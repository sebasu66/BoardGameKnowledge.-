origin. American and British games such as Monopoly, Scrabble, Cluedo, and Acquire were popular in German households. Ravensburger realized they needed to start publishing original
games, so they nurtured an in-­house design team to develop distinctly German games.

Other German game publishers and designers followed suit; however, customers were
unsure just which games were worth their time and money. German newspapers started running reviews of games. Specialty magazines Spielezeitschrift, Spielbox, and Die Popple-­Revue
emerged and were devoted exclusively to board and card games. To help consumers decide,
the Spiel des Jarhes (Game of the Year) prize was established in 1978 with the purpose of
rewarding family-­friendly game design and promoting excellent games in the German market. The criteria are that the game must be published in Germany and is judged by a panel on
four categories: game concept, rule structure, layout, and design.

Publishers soon noticed that the winners experienced a significant increase in sales, sometimes as high as 500,000 copies after winning the award. Since its creation, other categories
were added including best children’s games (KinderSpiel) and the Connoisseur’s choice
(KennerSpiel) as well as the Sonderpreis Schones Spiel (most beautiful game), Sonderpries
Komplezes Spiel (best complex game) and the Sonderpries Literatur im Spiel (best use of literature in game).
By the 1990s, there was a wide selection of board games for German consumers to choose
from. Early hits include Modern Art (1992), Manhattan (1994), El Grande (1995), and Die
Siedler von Catan (1995), which became one of the best-­selling board games of all time.
Another major influence on German board gaming culture was the rise of gaming conventions. The Essen Game Fair (or The Spiel) is the largest board game show in Germany, drawing crowds of more than 140,000 attendees. It is estimated that more than 1,000 new board
games debut every year at The Spiel alone!
This opportunity to sell games to such a large audience attracted independent game designers to The Spiel. These self-­publishing creators soon grew in numbers, giving rise to a growing
indie publishing scene. Many of these self-­starters who began at The Spiel have gone on to
become some of the industry’s biggest names including Friedmann Friese, Richard Breese,
and Matt Leacock.

As German gamers learned the names of their favorite game inventors and eagerly awaited
their next creators, the designers themselves weren’t always getting credit. In those days, if
you weren’t publishing your own game, it was unlikely that you were getting your name on
the front of the box. We will discuss why this is so important to you and all game designers
in Chapter 10 when we talk about the business of board games.

In 1988, 13 German game designers attending the Nuremburg Toy Fair signed their names
to a document (actually a drink coaster from the hotel bar!) on which was written “we commit to not sell games to companies that would not print the designer’s name on the box.”
This “Beer Coaster Proclamation” was an important step forward for all game designers.
Apart from a few larger publishers, it is standard practice for hobby game publishers to credit
the game designer on the box’s cover.

The German Game Becomes the Euro-­Game
Gamers from other countries started attending The Spiel and other German gaming conventions. They bought and brought these “German games” back home to their native countries.
Bilingual speakers translated their rules and posted them online. Discussions started to
appear on the forums of rec.games.board, the Game Closet, and Board Game Geek. Their
players raved about their simplicity, elegance, and beauty.
The popularity of German games spread throughout the board gaming world. In 1990,
designer Alan Moon held a get-­together known as the Gathering of Friends. In attendance
were several American game designers who got their first taste of German games, and soon
their mechanisms and traits began showing up in their designs. As a result, the term German
game just wasn’t applicable anymore. They no longer described games designed and

CHAPTER 8

239

published exclusively in Germany. These types of games were rechristened as Euro-­games and
subsequently Euro-­style games.

If you want to read more about the origins and evolution of Euro-­games, I highly recommend
the book Euro-­games: The Design, Culture, and Play of Modern European Board Games by
Stewart Woods (McFarlane and Co., 2012).

Euro-­Game Traits
So, how does a Euro-­game differ from all the other styles of games we’ve already discussed?
I’m glad you asked!
There are several traits that a Euro-­game exhibits—­especially in those games from the late
90s and early 2000s—­that are unique to this genre. These include the following:
■■
■■
■■
■■

Lack of “luck”
Lack of conflict
Loss
Emphasis on construction/growth

Let’s look at them, the good and bad.

Lack of “Luck”2
While many Euro-­games may include randomizers such as decks of cards, drawn tiles, and
even dice, their results usually don’t alter the outcome of the player’s action. Rather than
generating “good” or “bad” luck, they create opportunity, introduce diversity, and give you
more choices. For example, in Stone Age (2008), you roll dice3 to see how many resources are
available for your cave people to collect, while in Tiny Epic Galaxies (2015), you roll dice to
determine which actions you may perform on your turn.
If randomization occurs in a Euro-­game, it happens before the player acts—­which is called
input randomness. Remember input randomness from Chapter 3? Euro-­gamers love input
randomness because they can see the result of the randomizer and then have time to think
and plan how to use the result.

3

Ugh. There’s that word again. As a game designer, we really know it means randomness and probability.
You roll dice using a very thematic leather cup!

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

But when the random occurs after your plans are set, the random result can screw up all your
carefully made plans and strategies. This is, of course, output randomness. This is why so
many Euro-­gamers don’t like playing games with dice in them! They hate the lack of predictability and the lack of control on their turn. Heck, I know some Euro-­gamers that won’t even
play a game if there is a die in it! (That’s crazy! Dice are great! Besides, don’t they realize that
cards and bags of tokens are randomizers too?)
There are many ways that dice (and other randomizers) can be used in a Euro-­game. We covered many of them in Chapter 4, and we’ll discuss other mechanisms and strategies later in
this chapter.

Lack of Conflict
After the two world wars, German society was understandably fed up with anything to do
with warfare, conquering, and destruction. German game designs moved away from these
themes. That’s not to say that these themes of conflict (or even games set during this era) are
nonexistent, but the conflict found in them is often de-­emphasized or represented symbolically. For example, sometimes combat is represented by area control, but the results of that
interaction can vary—­from a player losing a piece to a piece retreating to where it came from.
More importantly, conflict between players is often avoided or nonexistent in Euro-­
games. That’s not to say that there isn’t competition between players, but direct conflict and
“take that” mechanisms are often minimized or excluded altogether. Gameplay that can lead
to bad feelings or antagonism is usually missing—­giving a Euro-­game a much more “peaceful” feeling for the players during play.

241

242

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

A by-­product coming from this lack of conflict is a lack of player elimination, in which a
player loses and is “out” for the rest of the game. Players might be able to reset their status,
choose a new character, get a temporary penalty, or return to play but with a slight handicap.
Personally, it is my favorite aspect of Euro-­
games. No one wants to not be able to
play the game!
Of course, some detractors feel that this lack of conflict deprives the players from interacting
with each other. Multiplayer solitaire is a pejorative term sometimes used to describe these
kinds of Euro-­games. It is used to describe the lack of interaction found, as in the other players might as well not be present as you play!

Loss
Loss is another thing that is de-­emphasized in Euro-­games. There may also be loss during the
game, but it is often conditional. In Catan (1995), when you encounter the robber piece, you
must reduce your hand by half but if you have more than seven cards in your hand. It is only
the “richer” players who are being punished when this event occurs.

Emphasis on Construction/Growth
When the German game industry avoided publishing games about warfare, conquering, and
destruction, German game designers looked elsewhere for inspiration. Remembering games
from their childhood such as Acquire (1964), 1829 (1974), Diplomacy (1959), and Hare and
Tortoise (1974), they concentrated on themes such as building, growth, negotiation,
and racing.

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

Dirk Henn, the designer of the game Wallenstein (2002) remembers, “I wanted to get the
game away from games like Risk, where you easily know what to do—­conquer as much as
you can. I really wanted to give the player an alternative way of winning the game, a more
defensive and constructive one. And when the girls in my testing groups liked the game, too,
I knew that it was as I wanted it to be.”4
Certain themes became prevalent: castle and city building, farming, route-­building (especially train tracks), political intrigue, racing (automotive and other), and economic
simulations.

Exotic Settings
A hallmark of Euro-­games are their settings based on real-­world locations. Why is this? Is it
that Europeans like to vacation abroad so they are exposed to these foreign lands? Are Euro-­
games an inexpensive way to “see the world”? Perhaps.
If a Euro-­game isn’t set in Northern Europe (Troyes, Bruges, Carcassonne), then they are set in
the South Seas (Bali, Goa, Java, Macao), South America (Puerto Rico, San Juan, Havana, El
Dorado), Southern Europe (Concordia, Pax Romana, Advanced Civilization), or the Middle East
(Marrakech, Timbuktu, Thebes, Alhambra). Dice Tower host and reviewer Tom Vasel once joked
that there are so many Euro-­games set in these locations that the genre should be called
“trading in the Mediterranean.”5

Game designers Geoff Engelstein and Ryan Sturm took inspiration from the trope when they designed their own
Eurogame Trade on the Tigris (2018). You can hear the development of the game on their podcast Ludology, starting
with episode 37: ludology.libsyn.com/ludology-­episode-­37-­the-­empty-­box

243

244

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Another trope of Euro-­games is that they are set in either the medieval or renaissance period:
Caylus, Orleans, The Castles of Burgundy, Fresco, Medici, Pax Renaissance. Is it that ancient
times are more romantic and simpler than modern times? Or is it that Europeans are constantly surrounded by their ancient past more than American designers?
In the earlier days of Euro-­gaming, many titles took place during the era of European colonization, which led to the criticism that Euro-­games glorify or at least potentially ignoring the
wording to the horrors of that era, including genocide and slavery.
In 2017, an article on the website Vice criticized Andreas Seyfarth’s 2002 board game Puerto
Rico, “It feels disrespectful for Seyfarth to disregard slavery so completely. By using slavery
as a gameplay mechanic without acknowledging the human cost of it (or even using its name
directly), by rendering the institution to a mere tool, the true costs of running your economic
engine are ignored. It almost seems to uncritically adopt the slavers’ mindset, without any
self-­awareness. The effect is to make players gathered around a table for a game of Puerto
Rico into unwitting moral accomplices in the horrors of human servitude.“6
As a result of these changing views, the game industry and designers have shied away from
making games about colonization. Puerto Rico (2002) was redesigned into Puerto Rico 1897
(2022). In it, the game takes place after the country attained autonomy from Spanish colonizers and abolished slavery.

Lack of Theming
Another criticism leveled at Euro-­game designs is that they focus so strongly on mechanisms
that theming is treated as an afterthought. Loot (1992), Lost Cities (1999), Splendor (2014),
Codenames (2015), and Great Western Trail (2016) are all popular Euro-­games that have been
accused of having pasted-­on themes. This criticism comes when the theme isn’t strongly
integrated with the mechanisms, as is the case of thematic games.
However, this criticism can be unfair for two reasons. First, we don’t know what the designer’s initial thoughts and designs were when creating the game.7 Second, there is a semi-­true
belief among the gaming audience that publishers will change the theme of a game (almost)
arbitrarily if it means reaching a bigger audience.

Goals
What Euro-­games might lack in theming, they more than make up for in giving a player
goals. Goals can be small steppingstones or prerequisites that lead to obtaining larger
rewards, or they can be the big reward at the end of the game. Or they can be an ongoing goal
that the player can focus on over the entire course of the game.
There are three types of goals—­short-term, mid-­term, and long-­term. As a designer, we
should strive to give players all three of these types of goals over the course of the game. In
my opinion, the best strategic games are ones that have you constantly shifting your strategy
and your goals over the course of the game. You might collect coins early in the game to buy
cards that activate abilities or actions during the middle of the game, which then allow you to

increase the output of your engine or build your card deck to generate even more points or
take bigger, riskier actions at the end of the game. This escalation of goals and the risk
involved in getting them is a big part of why we find board games so exciting!
During a Euro-­game, there will often be opportunities for you to score your goals as the
gameplay progresses or even during rounds. In Quacks of Quedlinburg (2018), players score
after they’ve either “busted” by going over seven points or decided to stop and not push their
luck any further. The game is scored, and the distance between the players may give trailing
players a handicap for the next round. In the farming game Agricola (2007), the scoring is
more complex. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a harvest at the end of
each stage (after rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).
There were so many diverse ways for players to score points in The Castles of Burgundy
(2011)—­such as placing a particular type of tile, filling in particular areas on the board, shipping goods, or having cash or resources left over at the end of the game—­that the term
point salad was used to describe the diversity of points. Critics of point salad say that by
having so many ways to earn points makes it hard to strategize, especially if you are new to
the game. And focusing so much on points as a concept takes the player out of the theme of
the game. There are those who defend it saying that by having so many ways to earn points,
you can try new strategies in each game. You can also get positive feedback when they earn
short-­term rewards that keep the player excited and engaged. Just like eating a salad, I think
it’s just a matter of taste.

Balancing Mechanisms
Going first often gives you better choices and puts other players at a disadvantage. Fairness
and balance are important to a Euro-­gamer, and designs often try to mitigate or remove this
first-­player advantage.
In Through the Desert (1998), the first player gets one action on their first turn, while all other
players get two actions on the first turn. From then on, all players get two actions. In Magic
the Gathering (1993), the player who goes first isn’t allowed to draw a card on their first turn.
In Go (–2200 AD), the second player gets additional points at the start of the game.

Catch-­up Mechanisms
Catch-­up mechanisms allow losing players an opportunity to still win. It might create a
handicap for a player who is doing better than the rest. In the game Kingsburg (2007), the
player who rolled the highest at the start of the round is the last to place their dice during the
round. The victory track of The Quacks of Quedlinburg has illustrations of rats on it. The number of rats between the winning player’s position and the other’s grants a rat token, which is
placed in the player’s scoring cauldron to advance its starting value.

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

Other mechanisms include giving players lower in the turn order more resources at the start
of the game, drafting hands of cards to equally distribute “good” cards to all players, or penalizing players with more resources such as the robber in Catan.

Shorter Playing Time
Another hallmark of Euro-­games is a short playing time. The average Euro-­games plays in
about 60 to 90 minutes, or 25–30 minutes per player. However, this isn’t always the case.
Some Euro-­games have been criticized for not having the playtime listed on the box be the
actual playing time. For example, a game’s box might say it takes 60 minutes to play, but in
reality, it takes the players 90 minutes to play, or even longer if players are learning the game
for the first time.

Wood Components Rather Than Plastic
When I first discovered Euro-­games, one of the most striking features of them was their use
of wooden components. These games featured wooden cubes and discs, wooden dice, and
whimsical player pieces in the shape of little people. When gamer Alison Hansel first saw the
wooden people in Carcassonne, she exclaimed, “I love my people!” However, it somehow
came out as “I love my meeple!” and the term stuck. A meeple can be any wooden character—­a pirate, a jungle explorer, a farmer, an elephant8—­that the player uses in the game.
Up until I discovered Euro-­games, I was used to board games having either plastic or metal
pieces. Wooden components, especially wooden components that were either painted or
carved into interesting shapes, felt luxurious, looked charming, and were interesting to the
touch. Remember, the tactile and aesthetic elements of board gaming are one of the great
pleasures for many.

The one exception is the sheeple, while used to describe sheep-­shaped meeples, the term was first popularized by
conspiracy theorist William Cooper.

Crunchiness and Weightiness
If you have been exploring the world of Euro-­gaming, you might have come across the term
crunchiness—­as in “This game is crunchy.9” Calling a game crunchy tends to mean that
there are several interacting rules that can be manipulated to the player’s benefit and mechanisms that can be manipulated by the player to interact in interesting ways. A game can have
a “low crunch,” “medium crunch,” or “high crunch” depending on its complexity. Dice Tower
podcaster Eric Summerer describes crunchiness this way:
“A crunchy game offers lots of levers to pull, parameters to tweak, and paths to follow. Small decisions
that can have sometimes unforeseen consequences, and a need to think through these decisions, are also
hallmarks of these games. Contrast this with a game that you can play more intuitively, from the gut,
without having to process too many steps at once.”

Crunchiness is often viewed as a positive attribute for a game to possess, but some players
can be turned off by it. “This game is too crunchy!” you might say.10 (Don’t talk with your
mouth full.) These games are often called brain-­burners because they offer so many
options that it becomes hard to determine what is the right or optimal choice. Your brain
“burns” thinking about all the choices and what consequences there are for a decision. Even
a simple card game can be considered a brain-­burner because of the decision space it offers.
Complexity and what to do to mitigate it in your design will be discussed in the next chapter!
While Euro-­games have traditionally been known to have lighter, easier rulesets and shorter
playtimes, there are also Euro-­games with complex, elaborate rules, many components, and
interacting mechanisms and arcane scoring systems. Games such as Civilization (1980),
Kanban: Automotive Revolution (2014), Food Chain Magnate (2015), and Root (2018) all spring
to mind when thinking of crunchy games. If you look at a game’s entry on Board Game
Geek.com, you’ll see a rating referring from 1 to 5 regarding a game’s weight. Weight, like
crunchiness, refers to a game’s complexity, but in slightly different terms. Weight refers to
questions such as “How easy is it to learn?” and “How hard is it to play?” and “How long does
it take to play?” These factors all apply to a game’s weight. Candy Land (1949), which has
almost no decision space, is a light-­weight game with a rank of 1.1 on BoardGameGeek.
Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition (2017), which has tons of decisions to be made, is a heavy-­
weight game11 with a 4.29. And just like crunchy games, some players love a weighty game,
and other players shy away from them.

The term has its roots in the mathematical term “number crunching”—which generally refers to taking large
amounts of related numerical data and organizing it into a more useful format.
10
What do you expect from a game made from wood and plastic? Pro-­tip: Never put games in your mouth.

Twilight Imperium isn’t even the highest weighted game on boardgamegeek.com! That honor currently
belongs to The Campaign for North Africa: The Desert War 1940-­43 (1979) with a weight rating of 4.74.

There’s nothing wrong with a game being or not being crunchy or weighty. It all comes down
to the kind of game you want to design. Now that we know Euro-­gaming’s traits, let’s look at
the mechanisms used to create its unique style of gameplay.

Euro-­Game Mechanisms
While we’ve talked about some of these mechanisms before, the following are the mechanisms that are predominantly found in most Euro-­games. These mechanisms tend to promote the gameplay found in this genre—­a lack of conflict, an emphasis on growth, a “race”
toward victory by tracking points and de-­emphasizing output randomness. These are examples of how they can be used to make a Eurostyle game:

Action Points
Action points (APs) are a specified number of points that players “spend” on gameplay
actions. Common actions in Euro-­games include movement (a single piece or multiple
pieces), building something, placing workers or tiles, crafting items, drawing a card, and rolling or re-­rolling dice, or they can even be used to grant another player an action! It’s like
wishing for more wishes! Some games allow a player to spend their points on the same action
several times in a row or on another player’s turn. The game Flashpoint: Fire Rescue (2011)
allows you to save actions for use on another turn.

249

250

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Each action has a predetermined cost dictated by the “strength” of the action. For example,
in the game Tikal (1999), players have 10 action points to spend each turn. Actions cost anywhere from 1 to 10 APs. Moving a member between two camps costs 1 action point and may
be performed many times on your turn. Excavating a treasure costs 3 APs, while establishing
a forward camp costs 5 APs. Your choice becomes “How do I best spend my points to gain the
best results each turn?”
Sometimes the number of action points that a player can spend is situational. In Photosynthesis
(2017), the number of actions you have available to use each turn is determined by how
much light falls on your pieces.
I like to use action points in my designs, because it gives players many meaningful choices
regarding what they can spend their points on. Of course, the actions must all be helpful to
the player in some way. It’s even better if players can combine the actions so that they can
create powerful combos.

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

Action/Role Selection
The term action/role-­selection can be applied to two different types of mechanisms. The
difference between the two is when the player can make the selection.
The first type is when you choose a character or role from several at the beginning of the
game. The choice is usually a unique ability that can be used situationally (such as once a
game) or on every turn. In most games, the roles are personified by characters and their special ability matches the action.
For example, in Pandemic (2008), if you are playing the dispatcher role, you can move other
players on your turn. If you play as the researcher, you may give any card to another player
if they’re in the same city, or another player may take any city card from the researcher if
they’re in the same city. Both roles have their usefulness, but each of them requires a totally
different strategy to play.
When designing this type of character role, you want to make sure each player’s action is
radically different from the next, so playing them will give the player a totally different play
experience. This also motivates the player to replay the game and try new roles.
The other type of selection occurs on your turn. It is often known as action selection because
you are usually selecting an action, not necessarily a role. This means that on every turn you
can choose an entirely different character and use its unique ability on your turn.
An example of this is found in Citadels (2000). On your turn, you select a new role. The selection not only grants you a unique power but also determines the order that it is played as
cards are prioritized in numeric order from lowest to highest. Lower-­numbered card abilities
are activated before higher-­numbered cards, sometimes affecting or nullifying the abilities of
the higher cards.
I used action selection in my game Rayguns and Rocketships: Retaliation (2024). Players have a
hand of action cards, and they select one each turn. Cards are revealed simultaneously and
are resolved in order from lowest to highest. This allows for certain actions to happen before
others—­which may protect a player from more powerful attack actions on higher cards.
However, if players reveal the same action on the turn, they are penalized by having limited
actions to choose from.
When you design an action selection game, make sure that the actions are distinct from each
other. The choices should all be good so that it comes down to when the player plays them to
make a difference between success or failure.

Arrangement
Arrangement often plays an important part in tile placement games. In Carcassonne, tiles
must be positioned so that they connect in “legal” ways. Roads must connect to roads, castle
walls must help complete castles, etc.
But tile placement games aren’t the only type of games where the concept of arrangement
matters. Some games require players to arrange resources in a particular pattern to complete
objectives and score points, such as creating buildings in Tiny Towns (2020) or creating tile
patterns to score points in Azul (2017).
In Honey Buzz (2020), each tile represents a different action. Whenever a group of tiles creates a specific pattern, a series of actions is triggered. The Castles of Burgundy (2011) has players match settlement tiles with colors on their player board to gain special abilities and
end-­game points while players of Calico (2020) arrange tiles into colorful patterns to lure cats
onto their cozy quilts!

Auction/Bidding
An auctions and bidding mechanism has you place a bid, usually money but sometimes
resources, on a good or an action. Players compete for the good by placing bids until one
winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the good or perform the action.
Once the items are purchased, new items will be offered. Usually, the item bid on becomes
useful later in the game. In Power Grid (2004), players take turns to bid on four power plants.
Once a bid is won, the player adds the power plant to their inventory. Provided the player has
the resources to power it, it will create power for the player that turn.

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

Sometimes there is a rule where the pot (a pool of resources) increases if the good or action
isn’t purchased or the cost of the good or action decreases, making it more appealing for you
to try players to bid on it.

Building
The theme of many Euro-­games is about building—­whether it’s a city, a castle, a farm, or a
spaceship. This emphasis on construction is in stark contrast to destruction featured in
Ameritrash games.12
The classic game Acquire (1964) has players placing square tiles onto a grid city. Hotel chains
grow, merge, and expand, increasing the player’s share in stock. In Expancity (2018), building is much more literal as you stack and construct tiny buildings on a shared city map.
Suburbia (2012) forgoes the literal buildings as you expand your urban sprawl in the form of
hexagonal tiles.
Galaxy Trucker (2007) has players construct a spaceship out of random parts. The ship is
then flown through meteor storms as they hope that enough of the ship is left over to reach
their destination!
Buildings in these types of games can often be upgraded. A great example of this is found in
Machi Koro (2012), where players can pay to “build” a landmark card that increase your abilities and the rewards you get on your turn.
There are some games where the building is even more literal, where the player constructs
physical structures that then are scored in a variety of ways. In The Climbers (2005), your goal
is to race up a structure of blocks that you move and rotate. In Pueblo (2002), you cooperatively construct a home for the Hopi chieftain, who inspects your work and awards points.
Santorini (2004) has you build temples for your loyal followers to climb and reach the
Greek gods.
For these types of designs, you can use wooden building blocks for your prototype, such as
LEGO or other construction toys, or if you have the means, you can 3D print your components. We’ll talk more about this when miniatures are discussed in Chapter 9.

Bag-­Builder
A bag-­builder mechanism involves a draw bag and some components—­usually tokens or
cubes. Despite its title, this mechanism isn’t about building a bag but rather its contents. On
each turn, players purchase or draft resources to be added into a cloth bag. The bag usually
starts with an assortment of good and bad resources. Adding to the bag increases the probability that the player will draw something good on their turn. However, more bad resources
will occasionally be added to prevent the player from drawing only positive results. Back
building and draw bags can be used in a variety of ways.
The Quacks of Quedlinburg (2018) has you begin with a small amount of good and bad
resources. Players buy more good resources to add to their bag. Each turn, the player draws
resources until they either decide to push their luck or go bust by drawing resources that
exceed a predetermined number. The game adds bad resources halfway through to keep
things interesting.
Clank! A Deck Building Adventure (2016) starts with black cubes in a dragon bag. Over the
course of the game, you add “noise” cubes to the bag whenever certain cards are drawn. If a
dragon attack is triggered, you draw from the bag. If a black cube is drawn, nothing happens.
If your color is drawn, you lose health.
Thebes (2007) has several bags—­each represents an archeological site. Players spend actions
to draw tokens from a bag. If you draw a treasure token, you keep it. If you draw a sand
token, it is added back to the bag. The more times you visit the location, the less likely you are
to find treasure and only sand.

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

When creating a bag-­builder, make sure that the components are the same size, shape,
weight, and texture. You don’t want a player to be able to tell the difference of the component by feel!

Buying/Market
Several Euro-­games feature a market where players can buy and/or sell resources—­such as
items, cards, or resources. The prices of these goods can vary over the course of a turn or the
entire game, often driven by a track or a deck of cards that informs the current price.
When creating a market, you will want to offer the player several choices. I find three to five
items in the market (cards, resources, etc.) is a good number to start with (you can always
adjust it with more playtesting).
You might want to let players also choose to buy the top card of the market deck as a blind
buy at a fixed price. This is risky because the player might buy an item that is worth less than
the fixed price, but on the other hand, they might buy a card that is worth more!
Some games have market items phase out or be replaced if they aren’t popular using what is
called a river mechanism. The cards on the river “flow” down. Think of it as a conveyer belt
of cards that gets pushed down as a new card is added. The cost of the cards decreases as the
card travels down the river, but once the first card in the river reaches a predetermined point
(for example, the market can have only five cards in it), then it is discarded from the game.

Choosing
In Euro-­games, choosing is often a way to balance out the game—­preventing one player
from getting too many advantages or powerful cards. One such application of this is known
as “I cut; you choose.”
One player creates two or more pools of resources/cards/dice with revealed values, and the
other player gets to pick which one they get first. There is a strategic element to this in which
you might want to make one pool more desirable than another while handicapping it at the
same time.
For example, let’s say we are playing a game where we roll six dice, and I must make two pools
of dice. I roll 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 6. I create one pool of 1, 1, 6, and the other are 2, 4, 4. Will my
opponent pick the high number die or go for the other pool with lower but more distributed values?

255

256

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

The other application of choosing is to give a player a choice rather than or in addition to a
blind draw. In Ticket to Ride (2004), players can choose from five face-­up ticket cards, or they
can draw from the face-­down deck. If they choose a more versatile wild card, they cannot
choose a second card. However, if they blindly draw a wild card first, they may still draw or
select a second nonwild card. The risk of the blind draw mitigates the benefit of knowing that
they are getting a wild card.
Yet another application of choosing is drafting, which we covered in Chapter 5. Remember,
this is where all of the available cards or resources are passed around the table and the player
is allowed to select one and pass the rest around to the other players. Drafting allows for an
equal and (somewhat) fair distribution of cards/resources to all the players.

Cooperation
Cooperation games are where players must work together to win. If one player is eliminated or if the players fail to accomplish several objectives within a predetermined time limit
or number of rounds, they lose the game.
Reiner Knizia’s Lord of the Rings (2000) is an early example of a cooperative Euro-­game.13
Each player plays one of the hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power. The
players all work together to overcome hardships as they approach Mount Doom. All players
either win or lose together.
Often players will be playing against an overlord player or an AI system that is working
against them, as in World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (2021), or a player who is helping
the others but in a limited or restricted capacity, such as the “ghost player” in Mysterium
(2015). We’ll talk more about designing AI in Chapter 9 when we discuss thematic games.

Knizia’s Lord of the Rings was an inspiration to game designer Matt Leacock to design the cooperative
game Pandemic.

Engine-­Builder
Engine building is a subgenre of the building genre. In it, players construct an “engine” made
of components that, when activated, score points and generate resources for the player. The
player’s goal is to create an efficient engine that gets better and yields a higher output each
round. After the first round or two, players will have many more resources at their disposal,
giving the player more choices and options.
In 7 Wonders (2012), players stack cards under their “wonder board” to gain more and more
resources on each consecutive turn. Wingspan (2018) has players building an engine out of
nests of birds. Then they spend resources to chain their bird’s special abilities and create as
many combos as possible for even more rewards and points.
The challenge for players of engine-­builders is to anticipate their need later in the game.
There’s a good chance that they might end up with a surplus of goods that they can’t use or
don’t want while other goods become difficult to obtain as other players have taken them.
There are a few ways to mitigate this: either allow for players to exchange resources at a
higher rate such as 2:1 or 3:1 or allow players to trade resources during a dedicated trading
round. By adding these rules, players won’t feel so “jammed” by their resources even if they’ve
made poor choices early in the game.
Another gameplay aspect you want to consider is allowing players to “switch gears” later in
the game. I’ve found that often in engine-­builders, if you’ve made uninformed or poor
choices early on, you are stuck for the rest of the game with the consequences of your choices.
While this is a good lesson to help improve players learning to play the game, no one likes to
sit through a game knowing that they are going to lose. Letting players exchange, trash, or
trade elements of their engine (with some sort of penalty for doing so) at least gives the
player a “fighting chance” to try to win the game even if the beginning of their game is not
optimal. No one is perfect, so create gameplay mechanisms to compensate for that.

Income
Income is where you gain an allotment of resources, either money, meeples, cubes, tokens,
etc. This can either happen by performing an action—­such as placing a worker onto a space
or during a specific phase during the game. For example, in Troyes (2010), you receive 10
coins at the beginning of a new turn, while a player of The Isle of Cats (2019) begins each
round with 20 fish! Others offer players a choice of income. In Western Legends (2018), every
player starts their turn by choosing to draw either $20, or two poker cards, or $10 and one
poker card.

257

258

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Some income is granted only if you have achieved a goal, position, or status in the game.
In Risk (1959), you get armies at the start of every turn based on what territory you control.
In Rival Restaurants (2019), at the start of the “money and move” phase, every chef gets an
income of 300 coins (or more if they have upgraded their restaurant). Income is a great way
to start players off on equal footing or to get them to the “good parts” of gameplay faster.
Designer Klaus Teuber discovered this when designing The Settlers of Catan (1995). His playtesters liked the game but complained that it was too slow at the beginning. He discovered
the solution was to “start the game on turn 3” by giving them resources they could place and
play right away.

Negotiation
Games with negotiation encourage players to make deals and alliances with each other.
Sometimes negotiation can take the form of a blatant offer—­which can be accepted or
declined. Negotiating might be an outright bribe to another player, which might be a way to
prevent a more powerful opponent from attacking you or taking an action you don’t want
them to. You might even try to bribe another player to convince them to team up with you or
another player!
If your design utilizes negotiation, have the rules allow for time for the players to negotiate.
In Werewolf (1986), players get three minutes to debate about which players might be the
traitorous werewolf.
Of course, just like with trading, you need to provide the player with valuable resources that
they can negotiate with. Follow the same rules as mentioned earlier to help stimulate negotiation in your games.

Placement
Another popular action found in Euro-­games is placement. This is where a player has a
choice of components and places them on a board or in relationship to another component
to gain a benefit. Three different mechanisms using placement are dice placement, tile placement, and worker placement.

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

Dice Placement
In a dice placement game, the dice are rolled first14 and then are placed onto the board or
player mat using their value or color to score points, bid for resources or points, or control a
territory.
They often have some prerequisites for placement. For example, in Sagrada (2017), players
can choose to place a die by number or color provided they aren’t in conflict with the rules of
placement (i.e., you can’t have two dice with the same number adjacent to each other).
In Achaia (2015), the value on dice is used to represent the strength of a warrior unit.
A 6 value on a die represents 6 strength, making it more powerful than a die with a value of
4. The player with the most strength gains control of the space. In Dice Hospital (2018), low
scores on the dice indicate the low health of a patient. The closer a patient gets to 1, the
closer they are to dying!
These games often have ways for the player to mitigate the results of the dice—­such as an
ability or item that can be purchased by the player. Please see Chapter 5 for more information on dice mitigation.

Tile Placement
Tile placement games require you to place a tile on your turn (usually a square cardboard tile)
to trigger actions, score points, or complete a map or some other geography. Tiles can be
positioned based on color, visual information (such as an image of a road on the tile), or even
trying to complete a specific shape or pattern.
Carcassonne (2000) is one of the most famous tile-­laying games. In it, players place square
tiles to create a board. Roads, castles, and pastures are connected on which meeples are
placed and scored. Kingdomino (2016) has similar play, but in this game the tiles are domino-­
shaped, making placement more challenging. Qwirkle (2006) requires players to connect tiles
to score based on a sequence of color or patterns. In Castles of Mad King Ludwig (2014), you
build a castle out of random room tiles. Rewards and penalties are given if specific rooms are
adjacent to each other—­such as the music room placed next to a bedroom. Turn off that
chamber music!
Tile placement is also commonly found in the 18xx family of games. Starting with designer
Francis Tresham’s 1829 (1974), this subgenre is about building train tracks and manipulating the stock market to earn dividends. The tiles used in 18xx games are hexagonal—­which
allows for more directions for route connections to occur.

Worker Placement
In a worker placement game, a set of actions is available to all players, usually defined by
spaces on the board. In turn, you place a component onto a space indicating that you want to
take that action. However, often there are a limited number of available spaces, resulting in
another player being “blocked” from using that space. Once all the components have been
placed, actions are resolved, and you gain the resources, benefits, etc., indicated by the
action space.
Sometimes, a space might have a requirement or cost for you to place your worker there. It
can be the color of the meeple or a cost in coins or resources.
Some spaces might accommodate many meeples. This is often a space that generates “common” resource—­such as a single coin or food resource. Other times the number of resources
available might be randomly generated using dice, as seen in Stone Age (2008). In some

261

262

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

games, there might be a queue for the workers. Depending on the order in which workers are
“in line,” you might come away with a low number of (or even no) resources.
Some worker placement games allow workers to remain on a space over subsequent turns to
continually generate a resource or benefit. Another player can “bump” your worker from that
space and place their own worker there. Either your worker is returned to you for reuse or
you might suffer a temporary penalty for being bumped.
In Raiders of the North Sea (2015), you may choose to replace a previously placed worker
(placed by anyone) with one of your own. The worker is returned to its owner, who can then
use it again on their turn. The turn ends once all players have placed their workers. The benefit of this happening is that you might get more actions on your turn, giving you more
opportunities on that turn. In all these types of games, you cannot keep replacing workers
that have been placed that turn (preventing an “infinite replacement loop” exploit).
In the game Dwellings of Eldervale (2020), if a worker is removed from play (usually during
combat), they go to an “underworld” location where they gain an additional benefit. This
removes some of the sting of having that piece removed from play.
Dwellings of Eldervale also have workers with abilities different than the “common” workers.
The wizard can be placed anywhere (doesn’t need to be adjacent to an already placed worker),
while the knight and the dragon grant two or three dice during combat, respectively. These
are represented by differently shaped and slightly larger meeples that help you tell the difference between them.

Follow Action
A follow action is a great mechanism because it not only acts as a balancing mechanism but
also keeps players engaged when it isn’t their turn.
A follow action happens this way: I place a worker at a space to gain its benefit, say five coins.
You may then take follow action by placing a worker there too, but the reward is often
reduced from the original action, so in this case you might get two coins. (Hey, it’s better
than nothing!)
In other games, a follow action costs resources instead of a worker, so your participation is
limited by whatever funds you might have. You can find follow actions in Euro-­games Puerto
Rico (2002), Villages of Valeria (2017), Tiny Towns (2019), and Fort (2020).

Seeking Information
Social deduction and the traitor mechanisms were previously discussed, but there are other
ways to seek information in games. Some games allow players an action to see a card, such as
in the deduction game Rear Window (2022). In The Mind (2018), a player can choose to discard a card, allowing the number of that card to become public information. A card might
grant you the ability to look at another player’s hand of cards or look at the top card or cards
of a deck to see what’s coming and take steps to avoid or gain it. The results of getting this
information can help inform voting or what actions to take.
When designing a game with this mechanism, think about how this knowledge will help the
player. Remember that you will lose the element of surprise if you allow this to happen too
often. It’s better that this is used as a “sometimes” mechanism.

Set Collection
Players are awarded points for collecting sets of things—­most often cards, but it can be
other components or even actions or locations on a map. Points might increase the more of
each thing you have. Often, these points are awarded at the end of the game, giving players
