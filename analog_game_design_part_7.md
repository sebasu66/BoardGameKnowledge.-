do. And so a game intended to teach about the environmental impact of plastic wrap may really provide players with improved hand-eye coordination and spatial awareness. Or a game
about immigration may really make players better at answering multiple choice questions
and optimizing their test-taking skills.
Consider Pandemic in this light. The game avoids ludopedagogical dissonance because it
was designed to be a game rather than as a ludic pamphlet or a play-powered film strip. The
premise of the game is containing and curing four virulent diseases by taking on the roles
of five CDC employees. One might say the subject of the game is the methods by which the
CDC controls and prevents disease, or the incredible complexities of containing disease.
Leacock does not seem to view the game as a tool for teaching players how to eradicate
the next plague. Though the game does impart a logically consistent high-level abstraction
of the CDC’s methods, that is not really the point. If you listen to Leacock discuss the game,
he focuses not on the narrative conceit, but on the design of the mechanics, the balance of
the roles and the tuning of the difficulty in achieving the win condition. These are all things
relating to the play experience. Leacock seems to view the pandemic containment premise as
the scaffolding players use to grasp the game’s goal and the mechanics enacted in its pursuit
and as a tool for expressing the internal logic of the game system. The game still provides
many insights and strengthens player skills — collective problem solving, probability analysis, decision-making within a tight choice space, and of course a high-level understanding of
the way the CDC approaches pandemics.
Pandemic supports the idea that games have a premise and not a subject. This may seem
like a subtle distinction, but it is an important point. A premise is something akin to the
set up of an improvisational theater piece, and not a strict plot to be followed from beat to
beat. In the course of following Pandemic’s premise, the players are, on the surface, wrestling
with the containment and cure of a set of diseases. But they are really doing something else
altogether. The players are exploring and working to navigate a ball and stick diagram overlaying a map and two sets of randomized cards with their only tools to fight back being an
economy of eight shared actions and a set of unique, per-role actions.

A friend of mine, the stop-motion animator M.T. Maloney, speaks of stop-motion animation being to film what poetry is to prose. Games are more like stop-motion animation or
poetry than film. To strive for high-fidelity themes, to perfectly model a phenomenon, denies
the potential of games, and in particular their expressive power; games need the freedom to
take liberties, to bend and break the known models of the world. This is necessary to create
a space of possibility within which play can unfold.
If you look under the hood, games are systems populated by objects with certain attributes that interact within a specified environment. While this might sound like the recipe for
simulations, it is more than that in the case of games. With serious games, we can certainly
attempt to accurately model our world and its phenomenon so that our audiences can grok
them. But unless you have lots of time, money and expertise, games are not good at providing high fidelity models of phenomena. And even then, the role of the player pushes back on
pure simulation. How can the player accurately model their role in the simulation without
losing most of their agency and freedom?

In the case of Pandemic, there is a nominal amount of understanding developed around
the fighting of pandemics by the CDC. The roles assumed by players roughly model the
kinds of people working on containing and eradicating disease; the general process by which
they go about the task— responding to the local spread of disease, tamping down hotspots,
responding to unforeseen epidemics, developing strategies for containing and ultimately
curing disease— is represented in a highly abstracted form. The genius mechanic for shuffling the played Infection cards and putting them at the top of the Infector draw pile every
time an Epidemic card is played seems to approximate the likelihood of an already-infected
region having additional outbreaks. But beyond this surface level detail embedded in the
thematic skin of the game, there isn’t really that much in Pandemic to accurately model the
process by which the CDC addresses virulent disease. If the CDC were ever to use the game
as a training tool, I imagine Leacock would be horrified.
VI.

A big part of the problem with serious games is the assumption that videogames are
the best approach. The reasons for this are complicated and are difficult to fully unwind,
but there are a few core reasons: many of the funders of this sort of work are particularly
interested in computing as a platform for enacting change; many of the people involved in
making the games are involved in the videogame industry and videogame education; the
target audience of most serious games is K-12 and college students, who are believed to live
in a digital world. But objectively, none of these should obligate the creation of serious videogames. As much as computation can and has done to augment human intellect, the solution
to every problem is not a serious videogame. Non-digital games are still a viable, sometimes
more appropriate solution.
In the case of Pandemic, the game and the play experience it affords as a boardgame would
suffer greatly from transposition to a videogame. The procedural characteristics of videogames would mask and obscure the most tangible and important contact points with the
game’s systems. The interaction with the Infection and City cards as physical objects give a
much more palpable engagement with the probabilities of epidemic outbreaks and the placement of virus cubes and the movement of player pawns create a direct connection to the
gameworld. All of this would be stripped away and automated in a digital form. Sometimes
we do not need or benefit from the advantages computation affords. Sometimes computation
subtracts or reduces rather than augments. Pandemic is such a case.
VII.
Serious games can learn a good deal from Leacock’s game and other German-style board
games: that games are practices, not products or media; that games are not a didactic form;
that games are more than simulations; and that games are often better off in non-digital
form. The bigger point is that Leacock approached the design project as a game. He wasn’t
seeking to convince anyone of how or why the CDC should do their job. He was designing a
board game that happens to lead to a number of different learning outcomes. If only serious
games were approached the same way more often.

DESIGN LESSONS FROM POKER
by Richard Garfield

Historically games were less designed than evolved. Not many of these games are credited
with a designer, and for those games that are, the contribution of the “designer” is usually a
small variation of an existing game. It is often worth going back to these traditional games
and looking at their characteristics, what made them work in their time and culture, or for
those that have survived to the current day, what makes them work across the times and
cultures in which they were popular. Poker is an interesting case from which I have learned
a lot.
Poker has Luck and Skill
One of Poker’s distinctions is how much luck it has. Anyone can win a hand of Poker. Yet
there is a lot of skill to the game. This betrays one of the
popular myths in game design – that skill and luck are
opposites. They are better considered as two axes.
As a game designer it is important to consider how
much chance you want in your game. I believe game designers in general have a bias toward reducing chance in
a game, perhaps because they tend to be excellent game
players and the games with less luck tend to showcase
their talent.
One of the most important things about a game
with a little more luck is that a larger breadth of
players can play it. This is not as important for

137

138

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

computer games, where you can draw on the player base of the world to find an opponent, but for analog games – you are often stuck with the folk who are currently
in your living room. Those people will not always be happy sitting down to a Chess
tournament, or a Starcraft game. They are much more likely to play a game like Poker, with a little more luck, a game where a player can always come back from behind.
Poker is Quick
An excellent characteristic for a game with a lot of luck is a short playtime. No one wants
to invest hours in a game and then have it lost on a coin toss. With Poker each hand only lasts
a few minutes – so having a lot of skill will – probabilistically – show itself within a fairly
short time, even if not in every hand.
An additional feature of a game with a short length like Poker is that it can fit into
any schedule – you can play Poker for a few minutes, or hours on end. You can link the
hands into a tournament, or have people flow in and out of the game, or even do what
some pals of mine at Adobe do – keeping track of the game over the course of years.
Poker has a Simple and Flexible Framework
It is easy to learn Poker, but when you learn it you have learned much more than a single
game. You have learned an operating system for a family of games. Going from 5 Card Draw
to 7 Card Stud to Texas Hold’em to Omaha to Dyslexic Blind Anaconda is easy once you know the
rank of the hands and the general play pattern. A couple of ways this idea can be applied to
game design are Magic: The Gathering or Dominion, where the rules are modified only by the
components, or the Mystery Rummy Series by Mike Fitzgerald, where the rules change from
game to game – but the general structure is the same. This idea can also be used simply by
leveraging the rules for different games the players already know – for example, role playing
games often use elements like levels and experience, saving their innovation for different
parts of the game. Every unusual rule in a game has a cost to the new player, and a designer
should make sure that the cost is worth the benefit.
Poker is Customizable
Poker is extremely customizable. There are many different types of Poker and many different styles of game. Dealer’s Choice Poker even takes this to the extreme, with the dealer choosing the game to be played when they deal. The concept of players really taking ownership
of their play experience in this way is unusual, it is much more common for players to look
to the game rules or the game publisher for “the right” way to play. As a designer, one can
explore different ways to play one’s game and present some of these to the players, with an
invitation for them to customize the play for the tastes of their playgroup.
Poker has Hidden Information
When one player knows something that another player doesn’t a world of game opportunity opens up. This opens the door to game theory – where there is bluffing and misdirection, and the play of the game can leap from the dry statistics of the rules into things like
reading the opponents and smelling fear. At its best it allows a heady mix of intuition and
reason that is hard to match. Hidden information is not appropriate for all games, but I never
design any game without considering it long and hard.
Like luck in games, hidden information can increase the breadth of players that will play
it. Whenever I learn a new game with no hidden (or inconsequential) information I know
there are some players in my playgroup that will make that game a misery to play. They are
not doing it to be abusive – but they can’t help themselves when the optimum line of play is

Game Analyses

there to be calculated. Even the luck of dice may not reduce their calculation – because they
can always seek the probabilistically best move. But if there is meaningful hidden information they can’t overcalculate because they know that other people might be misleading them.
And they also can make more arbitrary moves because they know that this may mislead the
opponent.
Poker is not Very Political
It is difficult to pick on a player in Poker. For very casual players this is not so important;
given the opportunity to pick on another player in a game like Risk, for example, they will
always pick on the leader or take the most obviously advantageous move that they see. With
more sophisticated players however, the politics can easily become the central feature of the
game: alliances will form and players will be picked on not for their position but for their
allegiance or lack of allegiance. In itself, this is not a bad thing – there are many excellent
games that focus on this (most notably Diplomacy), but it is a characteristic of the game that
will dominate all other parts of the game if the politics becomes too pronounced.
Poker has Stakes
Typically Poker is played for money. Most players find that unless it is played for money
it is pointless. If you experiment a bit, however, for some playgroups one may find that there
are some ways around this – for example, playing a tournament where you can’t buy back
into the game. In this case the stakes are elimination from the game. My pals from Adobe
have another solution as mentioned above, they keep track of the results over the course of
years – and players value their “score” because it is being recorded. The score is a measure
of game honor.
Playing for stakes has an interesting effect on a game, whether or not the stakes are money or honor. The stakes make it so that players are playing for more than just first place, they
are competing every hand to win and it means something to them even if they are still in
dead last. I have used this mindset to completely alter the nature of a Hearts league I played
in, where we played as if we were playing for money and kept track of the results. It is amazing how that change alters the play of good players!
Ways this might be leveraged in an original game design might be to link together small
game scores into a larger metagame that takes place over hours or even months. When the
metagame is nearing the end, players will start playing in a different way as they begin to
worry more about their rank relative to the other players and less about their particular
score. You can see this happen in games like Hearts, in which players start off just worrying
about their score, then later in the game the person in the lead is simply trying to get points
on the person furthest behind to end the game.
Last Thought
Several years ago I saw a panel of distinguished computer game designers which included Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari. They were asked what games they drew inspiration
from – and while his copanelists mentioned computer games which were occasionally so
recent they couldn’t really have had much formative impact – Nolan said “Golf.” It was long
enough ago I am sure my memory embellishes this – but I imagine a giggle running through
the audience simply because my experience has been that so few people really pay attention
to the truly classic games like Golf, or Poker with regard to what makes them well “designed”
games that have endured over a century. To lose sight of that not only costs a designer a rich
supply of ideas, but more tragically, cuts them off from our heritage of games which extends
back not twenty-five or fifty years but millennia.

APPLYING DESIGN CONCEPTS FROM RA TO DIGITAL GAMES
by Brian Magerko

My interest in boardgames used to be solidly focused on playing Chess. My notion of other
boardgames was that they were either boring versions of Candyland or party games, neither
of which held my attention very long. The only exception to this view was my experience
with Eberle et al.’s Cosmic Encounter in graduate school, a fantastic game experience that I
enjoyed but never took as any indication that there was a plethora of other game design innovations out there to discover. It was not until a friend in Chicago introduced me to his
boardgame group that I discovered, quite embarrassingly late in my career as a researcher
in digital games, that boardgames were not only played often by adults, but also that a renaissance of boardgame design had taken place. Instead of games that involved simple die
rolls and moving around a board or trading card games like Magic, which did not interest
me, there was an entire spectrum of new kind of games to experience that provided a deep,
intricate, often elegant experience with game mechanics that did not overly rely on chance
nor have obvious strategies. My first and most memorable such experience was with the
Reiner Knizia game, Ra.
Ra is about playing through the major historical epochs of ancient Egypt (the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom) and collecting fame points through the
acquisition of different valued tiles at auction. This game represents a wholly unique experience, especially for a newcomer to modern boardgames. The board is hardly significant. As
opposed to focusing on moving game pieces around a board, this three-to-five player game
is essentially a competitive auction. Unlike Chess, in which materiel and position contribute
heavily to a single goal of capturing the opposing king, Ra creates an experience where there
are multiple possible goals to pursue, and what a player decides to follow can change from

141

142

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

game to game and within a single game. Playing Ra felt more like playing a game like the
digital game Starcraft in which players have multi-dimensional goals to consider in a strategy, than a boardgame like I was used to playing. I was hooked.
This chapter will briefly explore the main mechanics of the game, though I highly recommend playing it. It will then discuss what makes this game unique. Finally, it will follow
through the exercise that the Digital Tabletop project (digitaltabletop.org) typically undergoes
– a comparison between the interesting mechanics present in a boardgame (in this case, Ra)
with what is / isn’t done in modern digital games. The purpose of this comparison is to better inform game design in both domains as a practice.
The Game
The game mechanics of Ra are fairly simply. A game lasts three rounds (called epochs).
Players take turns choosing among a) drawing a tile from a bag and placing it on the ‘auction block’ on the board, b) starting a voluntary auction to set off a round of bidding on the
items on the auction block, or c) discarding a God tile to grab a tile off of the auction block
(see below). Tiles drawn are either: Gods (worth +2 at the end of an epoch or can be used as
an action to grab one tile off of the auction block), Niles and Floods (Niles are worth +1 if you
have a flood), Civilization (-5 if you don’t have any at the end of a epoch, worth points if you
have multiple Civilizations of different types), Monuments (worth multiple points at the end
of the game), Gold (worth +3 at the end of a round), and the Ra tile, which instantly starts an
involuntary auction when a player draws it from the bag.
An auction involves each player getting exactly one bid on all of the tiles on the auction
block. Highest bid wins. When a player wins an auction, they pick up all of the tiles on
the auction block and exchange the single Sun used for winning the auction. The next auction winner then exchanges for that Sun, etc. The Sun obtained by the winner is theirs and
turned face down, to be used in the next epoch.
Once a certain number of Ra tiles have been drawn, then the epoch is over. Players add up
their points for that epoch, which are affected by the tiles they currently hold or don’t hold,
and begin the next epoch with the same Suns that they held in the previous epoch. If they
have some Suns still face up (i.e. they didn’t use them to buy anything during this epoch),
then they were simply not used. This is common when players hold onto high value Suns
and then the epoch suddenly ends.
Why Is It So Compelling?
The use of Ra tiles to count down each epoch is of particular interest. Ra tiles serve as a
probabilistic device for reaching the end of an epoch. It is possible that players will never
draw a Ra tile, but will instead go through all of the valuable tiles in succession. It is also
possible that players will draw Ra tiles until the end of an epoch without ever drawing a
tile of value. It is much more likely that a combination of both will be drawn, but this is
a core feature of Ra that makes it so fascinating – players always have to keep in mind the
likelihood of the epoch ending at a certain time. As discussed below, this likelihood plays
prominently into how tiles are valued, player long-term and short-term strategy, and buying
decisions.
The complexity of the evaluation function that players attempt to use during nearly every
single tile draw is part of what makes this game so compelling. For each player at the table,
there is likely a very different evaluation going on. Even if an auction doesn’t happen, when
a new value tile (i.e. not a Ra tile) is drawn, players are constantly reconsidering their current

Game Analyses

strategies, considering the value of the current auction set to the other players, and pondering the use of a God tile if they have one. When an auction does occur, a player’s evaluation
of how much they should bid is dependent on a wide array of factors, and the influence of
those factors depend on the player’s strategy for winning, what epoch the game is in, and
how many Ra tiles are out on the board (i.e. how probable it is that the game will end soon).
A key unifying feature of the game is that the values and probabilities (of tiles and Suns)
change with each new non-Ra tile drawn; with each new Ra drawn, signifying that an epoch
is getting closer to ending; and with each new epoch, which means that the game as a whole
is closer to the end. If an epoch is one Ra away from ending, players are faced with spending
that precious twelve Sun on what earlier in the epoch would have been bought with possibly
a four or a five.
The relationship between decision-making and drawing tiles is connected to the fact
that the likelihood of drawing a certain tile at any given time is dependent on the previous
draws. Players are drawing from a fixed and continually decreasing resource. Just as in
Scrabble, there are n tiles in the bag and once a tile is drawn, the bag has n-1 tiles remaining.
In other words, if there are multiple civilizations that are drawn early in the game, players
may note that civilizations will be a scarce resource in later epochs.
The fact that there isn’t a clear mapping, as pointed out above, from early or mid-game
state to player success, makes it all the more interesting when trying to make decisions as a
player. A large part of the experience of a player is trying to figure out how much an auction
is worth to them versus forcing another player to spend more than they would want to. All
the players are on a journey of trying to mentally summarize how well everyone is doing,
how well everyone is likely to do given the game history to this point, and what to do at this
moment (do I start an auction? what should I bid right now?). The factors for deciding if /
what to bid are:
• What tiles the player and everyone else has
• Their absolute value
• Their relative value
• What sets are desired for this epoch (e.g. wanting one more Civilization to get
extra points)
• What tiles are desired for the last epoch (e.g. wanting more Monuments to get
extra points)
• What numbered tiles players are primed to start with next epoch
• What the current epoch is
• How many Ra tiles are on the board
• How many Ra tiles have been discarded in previous epochs
• How full the auction row currently is
• How many of each tile have been previously drawn
• What bids are on the table for the current auction, if any
• How many Suns each player has left
• Everyone’s projected score
• What Sun would be gained with the current auction

143

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

As mentioned above, there is a ton to compute. It is immeasurably difficult for even an intermediate player (I cannot say much for experts, since I am not one nor know any) to say with certainty
what a winning strategy will be in the first two epochs of any given game. The actual leader of
the game does not generally materialize until at least the last half of the second epoch, if not later.
Comparison to Digital Games
My academic research is mainly involved with the design and development of game-based
experiences that have AI as a core component. It has led me to think about the design of digital games, give lectures on design to undergraduate and graduate students, and think about
the affordances that different approaches to AI can bring to a digital game experience. When
the floodgates to boardgames opened with my introduction to Ra, I was suddenly exposed to a
wealth of game experiences that I really hadn’t considered before. Boardgames had their own
set of game mechanic clichés and innovations that had some overlap in the digital realm, but
was definitely separate. I co-founded the Digital Tabletop (thedigitaltabletop.org) as a means of
collaboratively exploring the relationship between digital games and boardgames. As stated in
the mission on the project website, the purpose of the group is to engage in “…discussing the
game mechanics used in designer boardgames & other tabletop games, their relationship or possible influence on digital games, and a meta-level discussion about the intersection of non-digital
games and digital games within the context of academic game studies.”
Ra was truly the catalyst for the creation of this group and the first boardgame studied. Our
main finding was that the main experience in gameplay – the auctioning of non-replenishing
resources with the value of both the currency and the resources changing over time - has no
obvious parallel in the digital (or even the non-digital, to the best of my knowledge) game world.
Basic auctioning mechanisms occur in MMO’s for example, but they are more of the traditional
type rather than the kind seen in Ra. The key feature here is that the value of any given set of tiles
or resources is highly contextual. This goes beyond the concept of picking a strategy to best match
your opponent’s (e.g. catapults in some Civilization games may be less useful if nearby opposing cities have knights that have multiple movements per turn). The decision to obtain more
resources for auctioning (i.e. drawing from the tile bag) has a direct effect on the value of those
resources (i.e. you may draw a Ra tile, making the end of the epoch that much sooner).
Considering the auctioning mechanism in Ra could lead to some interesting interactions in
existing games. For example, Counterstrike: Source allows you to purchase weaponry and armor
before each battle. One could imagine a Ra-style auctioning mechanism that blends battle success
(e.g. if you kill someone, you swap your lowest sun with their second-highest) with between-battle auctioning. In other words, more thought would need to go into who you attacked (similar to
which auction you decide to start or bid on) based on how it would affect future attacks (similar
to what Sun you wind up with when you win an auction). The addition of having fixed resources
could also be expanded in games (e.g. only some percentage of civilizations in Civilization can
learn any given technology or only so many sniper rifles exist for purchase in a round of CounterStrike: Source) with an inclusion of a Ra tile-esque component that, when it appears, counts down
a timer that will effect which resources are accessible (e.g. temples are unavailable in Civilization
after a certain number of ticks on the timer go by). This would lead to the kind of game theoretic
situations that occur in Ra, where players not only reason about the absolute value of obtaining
resources but also the relative value according to how much of that resource is left and how much
longer it will be available.

Game Analyses

The approach of conducting a transmedia comparison of mechanics across digital games and
boardgames has been an interesting design path to travel. It has lead to multiple novel concepts
for digital games via the discussions on the Digital Tabletop blog. However, like any design ideas,
the real test of how these ideas would work out is in implementing the ideas in actual playable
games. The examples provided above are not so much obvious amazing improvements to the
games discussed, but more so thoughtful attempts at how we as designers of digital games can
learn from the rich mechanics in boardgames like Ra when considering new game designs or
updating takes on standard digital game genres.

TRAIN: FROM BLACK BOX TO WHITE CUBE
Simon Ferrari

Train is part three of Brenda Brathwaite’s “The Mechanic is the Message” project.40 It is a
game about one of modern history’s most traumatic events, meant to teach through interaction rather than narrative. Train is a work of fevered inspiration, declared a work of Torah by
a respected rabbi.41 It is undeniably the work of an artist, though it is unclear exactly what
the term means in an era when many consider the very concept of art to be dead. Brathwaite
brings Train with her around the country, like a circuit preacher, carrying the precious cargo
in her transport of choice: a German sports car. Clad in leather and one of her many pairs of
fabulous shoes, she summons the work into a space and then walks away as people begin to
play it.
Presenting at an academic conference on the art history of games, Brathwaite stood before
a crowd of jaded intellectuals and stated, “I’m an artist, and I’m sensitive about my shit.”42
It’s difficult to separate Train from Brathwaite’s charismatic persona. This means that judgments of the game almost always collapse into judgments of Brathwaite herself. People take
Train personally. Either they instantly see how the game works and why it’s so effective for
them, or they question the depth of its design and intent, or they lash out in disbelief at
Brathwaite’s nerve and poor taste: “She made a game about the Holocaust?” Or is it “out of
the Holocaust?”
Of course, many people make these same judgments about Train and its creator, positive
and negative, without even playing it. Discourse around the game is fragmentary to say the
least. In order to avoid retreading old ground and the common pitfalls plaguing many articles on Train, I’d like to begin with a question that I haven’t seen asked before: “Why trains?”
If the purpose of the game is to remind us of the brutality of the Holocaust, or to make us

147

148

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

think about it in a way that we haven’t before, why would this one aspect be singled out?
Although we can point to a few examples of games that focus on the development and traversal of railway, the answer, I think, lies in the wider tradition of tabletop train play outside
the history of formal game design.
Many children desire at some point to be a train conductor or engineer, in much the same
way that they go through periods of wanting to be a fireman, an astronaut, or even a garbage
collector.43 The vehicles coupled to these professions wear their functions on their sleeves,
so it’s easy for children to comprehend their purposes and aspire to controlling them. This
impulse is actively marketed to, so there are miniature trains for every age range imaginable—from a child’s first wooden Brio set to the intricate models of adult hobbyists. Typically
arranged in a loop and surrounded by miniatures of small town civilization, toy and model
trains don’t “go” anywhere. They’re based on a nostalgic picture of how local rail works, a
larger than life, sexy contrast to the contemporary reality of subway systems.
Most importantly, train sets create a spatial form of storytelling: passengers go in the carriages, the engineer in the engine, and the cargo in the freight cars. Ask any child about the
trains they’re playing with, and they’ll be able to describe, in detail, the daily life of the town
ands its people that surround the track. And when Brathwaite was testing Train to make sure
that its mechanics made for enjoyable play without its infamous reveal moment, she told her
daughters that the train was headed to Disney World.44 It is our failure to remember this
storytelling function of train sets that Train exploits.
Adult train play is more about the machine than about the people who ride it. When I
was younger, my father and I volunteered to run a model train competition at a local train
show. This competition—a sort of logistics race—focused solely on the procedural aspects of
train operation. Three players were tasked with linking a series of freight cars to an engine
they controlled. This required driving the engine forward, switching a junction, and then
reversing slowly to catch a latch between the engine and the target freight car. Once three
freight cars were attached in the proper sequence, the players proceeded to the end of a linear course, stopping only to reconnect cars if they became detached.
As one can expect, nobody asked where the trains were headed or what they were carrying. The freight and the track’s terminus had nothing to do with the task at hand.
Train as game
Looking at Train, any game designer or convinced ludologist probably asks at some point:
“Is Train a good game? Why would I play it instead of any other game about trains?”
Anyone with an iDevice need not travel across the country to play a well-designed railroad game. Trainyard, a puzzle game by Mark Rix, performed remarkably well in the iDevice
App Store in late 2010, even in the face of overwhelming competition from the far more popular genre of simple physics games.45 Players trace tracks into existence with their fingers,
connecting starting hubs to endpoints while avoiding collisions. The game layers obstacles
and mechanics steadily, requiring players to navigate around rocks or combine two trains of
different color before they can enter an endpoint. Mid-level play requires a basic understanding of track switching, and the game affords easy track erasing and editing for fluid testing
and execution. Like the model train competition mentioned above, Trainyard has no fiction,
though each puzzle does bear the name of a city.
We don’t even need to look outside the tabletop to find other examples. Ticket to Ride, a
German-style boardgame designed by Alan Moon in 2004, tasks competing players with
connecting real-world cities by claiming routes along a network of predetermined, color-

Game Analyses

coded tracks.46 The game is remarkably minimalist, allowing players to take only one of
three actions per turn: draw two color-coded train cars, choose (at least one of three randomly-drawn) destination cards linking one city to another, or claim one section of track.
Strategy here is a combination of cost-benefit analysis—measuring one’s ability to connect
two locations and claim destination points against the likelihood of failing to do so (and thus
losing points at the end of the game)—and underhanded sabotage—purposefully claiming
tracks that one’s opponents need to complete their own destination cards.
Both of these games focus on the creation of tracks, their destinations predetermined.
They make no mention of what the trains are carrying, their common color-coded designs
creating challenge rather than denoting anything special about the trains themselves. Trainyard and Ticket to Ride possess a number of qualities we associate with good design: they are
mechanically elegant, allowing players to do a lot without having to memorize too many
rules; thus they’re easy to pick up, yet difficult to master; and they provide ample amounts
of replayability, the former through an exhaustive puzzle list and the latter by way of a large
possibility space and optional expansions.
In contrast, Train can be awkward to play. Players have to constantly refer back to the
rules, which are sometimes purposefully vague and difficult to read on account of their
printing method. And, after playing Train, few players seem to want to come back for a second helping. Even if they desired to replay the game, they’d have to travel to the one place
where it’s currently on display to do so. So why was Train quickly canonized as a premiere
example of the expressive power of games? What does it have that other railroad games
don’t?
There’s an austere beauty to Train’s board, pieces, and instructions: muted browns and
steely grays predominate, striking a powerful contrast with the bright yellow of the “people”
pieces. The little yellow people are almost weightless, especially compared to the heft of
Train’s cardboard action cards. This imbues fragility to the people pieces and gravity to one’s
choices. Surrounding the track board are two fetish objects: an antique typewriter, which
Brathwaite uses to produce the game’s rulebook, and a broken window pane that the players
are encouraged to smash with a hammer at the beginning of the game. Even if players don’t
immediately recognize the significance of these objects, they are presented in a straightforward and solemn way that informs how they should be interacted with.
The rules don’t try to explain what Train is “about”; they simply tell players their allowed
actions and the order of play. Each of three players controls a train car on its own track,
which is staggered against the other two. Each turn, a player takes one of four actions: load
her train car, move her car, draw an action card, or play an action card. The actions cards
allow a player to accelerate her car, damage a track, repair a track, join her car with another,
or derail a train to make it lose half its passengers. Players are told that they get “100,000” for
each of the 60 tiny yellow game pieces they bring to the end of a railway. Once a car reaches
the end of a track, the player must remove its pieces and place them on a Terminus card.
“Train,” the final rule reads, “is over when it ends.”
This ruleset and the tracks are designed for genuine tactical complexity: it is fun to try to
stymie the efforts of other players to reach their Terminus, to break their tracks, to pack as
many tiny yellow people into the cars as one possibly can. And then the game makes a major
reversal once the first Terminus is reached. The Terminus cards reveal to what concentration
camp a train car has arrived. Each of the 60 yellow pieces represents 100,000 human lives,
totaling the 6 million lost during the Holocaust. This is a snap contextualization, a kind of
narrative twist called anagnorisis—realizing that Bruce Willis was a ghost all along in The

149

150

Sixth Sense or that Oedipus is the son of Jocasta and Laius.47 Players now realize the meaning
of the two fetish objects: the typewriter was manufactured for use by the Schutzstaffel (SS),
while the broken window was meant to invoke Kristallnacht.
According to Brathwaite, all but a few games of Train have ended once the first Terminus
card has been drawn. To those who have not seen or experienced Train, it might seem that the
game relies too heavily on this realization for its strength, that “the Holocaust is not a twist
ending.” The game’s greatest defense comes from Ian Bogost, who argues that it is a “game
of gestures.”48 Players modify their attitude toward the game and its pieces, according to
Bogost, once they realize what’s happening. For instance, he observed that a number of players made it a personal rule to always organize the yellow game people into neat little groups
after every turn. After the Terminus reveal, this ordering retroactively becomes a signifier of
crowd control. A contextualization such as this takes on greater meaning in a game than it
could in any other dramatic medium.
Brathwaite does not intercede at any point during the game, and she won’t comment
on its meaning. Bogost himself holds that the game “never makes an argument about the
Holocaust.”49 Yet surely it simulates something: first the mind of a strategic mass murderer
who has mentally converted human beings into numbers, second the sobering process of
realization experienced by the German people after the fall of Berlin. This goes far beyond
creating a feeling of complicity in the player. Complicity only exists within a specific legal
context, and morality is a social construction. In the cultural logic of Nazi rule, players have
committed no crime or moral violation. Instead, Train is a game about the banality of evil.
It’s about what happens when we accept the rules and instructions handed down to us by a
higher authority. Train is a game about playing games.
One under-discussed aspect of the game’s re-contextualization is the meaning of the
competition between players. Perhaps the players were Nazi commanders vying against
each other for a promotion. Or maybe it’s an indictment of organizational politics in general.
What’s clear from all our examples of competitive train-based games is that an agonistic relationship between players leads to less discussion about fictive context. This is something that
most “pure” game designers actively desire: why waste time discussing where the trains are
going when there are tactics to master and opponents to best?
Jean Lave has argued that task-oriented cognition is better understood as the setting of
expectations, or “potential resolution shapes,” rather than the planning of explicit goals.50
In competitive games, goals and expectations are clearly more conflated than they are in
everyday cognition. One expects only that, in satisfying the win conditions, one will be
duly recognized as the best player of the lot. We don’t expect our in-game actions to signify
anything outside the “magic circle” of play, except perhaps producing some small amount
of pride for being generally clever enough to have won. Train thus foregrounds the subdued
cognitive formation of expectations characteristic of competitive play.
Our hypothetical ludologist or pure game designer may now re-emerge to ask one final
question: “Why should I play Train once I already know how it ends?” One measure of a
game is not what designers and critics think about it, but what players do with it.
As with any well-designed game, there’s more than one way to play Train. During some
play sessions, the players have openly discussed how the game works. Some have used the
“derail” card to free as many yellow pieces as possible, interpreting the loss of half the car’s
passengers as them escaping from their captors. But this interpretation is messy; we all know
what happens when a train derails—people die. For my play session, I devised a different
strategy. In the wake of common knowledge about its context, players consciously bear the

Game Analyses

role of a Nazi officer; therefore, they may revel in their brutality, to see how it feels. Their efforts to be the best at delivering human beings to slaughter emulate the openly competitive
nature of a military hierarchy.
But if a player of Train foregoes the two mechanics of loading and moving trains, it frees
up a considerable amount of turns for accruing and spending resource cards.51 The pool of
cards is limited, so this player will eventually be able to collect every “repair” card within
the deck. Once she has done so, she has only got to break each of the three train tracks to end
the game in a stalemate (“Train is over when it ends”). If one balances the collection of cards
with stalling tactics, it is possible to finish a game of Train without any tiny yellow people
reaching a Terminus. The game becomes even more exciting once the players filling the roles
of dutiful Nazis realize the strategy: they will begin racing to a Terminus or trying to pull a
repair card in an effort to prevent their own failure. Instead of competing against each other
for a higher score, the Nazi players cooperate to quash their shared enemy. Train effectively
becomes a simulation of wartime resistance.
It is Train’s spatial simplification of the German transportation system that makes this
alternate play style possible. The design expresses universality to a series of population displacements that in fact occurred quite distantly (spatially and temporally) from each other.
In the dominant reading of the game first discussed, this placement of the tracks next to each
other helps simulate the mentality of the Nazi officer who has turned people into numbers
and their displacement into a uniform process. But because the entirety of the nation’s rail
network is reduced to three contiguous tracks, and because the three Termini exist alongside
each other, one is able to bottleneck movement in a way that wouldn’t be feasible during the
actual conflict.
Train’s value is best understood not as a laundry list of traditionally desirable features
but as an aesthetic experience uniquely rendered by the manipulation of a now-dead rule
system. In Newsgames: Journalism at Play, my co-authors and I discern three categories of realism in “documentary games,” or games that recreate historical events.52 The weakest realism is spatial, the reconstruction of a historical space for casual, unguided exploration. The
middle ground is operational reality, guiding the player through a historical problem space
by the establishment of a specific role and a series of tasks. The most promising category of
documentary reality is procedural; it models a historical rule system to expose “the behaviors underlying a situation, rather than merely telling stories of their effects.”53 And it is this
truest form of ludic documentary work that Train exemplifies.
Train as art
Many contemporary games raise questions about the relationship between games and
art, but few actually help answer these questions. Train comes at a time when many game
designers struggle for popular recognition of their work as art, as the building blocks of a
new expressive medium. The reasons for this are many, but the primary motivation may
come from two fundamental misunderstandings—first, that games lack some form of legitimacy, and second, that artistic merit is the highest measure of cultural value. Games predate humanity, narrative, and art. Nothing so old and integral as play need ask for cultural
legitimacy. Nevertheless, attaining the recognized status of art grants one’s work notoriety,
increased chances for funding, and a guarantee of archival preservation.
Train has now been played at game industry conferences and academic symposia, in galleries and the Strong Museum of Play. It fits traditional display contexts, with its strong
visual rhetoric of the yellow people pieces standing out against the somber tones of the

151

152

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

rest of the board. Yet, alongside other recent examples of “gallery games,” its place in these
formerly hallowed places becomes problematic. When I played Train at the Kai Lin Art Gallery, alcohol was served. Although those in attendance were expected to drink only a polite
amount, things tend to get rowdy when games are involved. A few feet away, crowds were
laughing and shouting during a heated game of Sixteen Tons.54 Grinning as he sauntered up
to the table bearing Train, one of my soon-to-be opponents made an exclamatory, drunken
joke about how we were “gonna kill some Jews.”
It wouldn’t make sense to demand that visitors to a gallery featuring games be completely quiet, serious, and contemplative. Why clip the wings of a form that inspires exuberance,
roughhousing, and trashtalking when so few pieces of art are able to muster such behavior?
Even the flippant bigotry of my Train opponent has to be accommodated in some way for the
spirit of play to remain alive inside art’s white cube. The Dutch historian Johan Huizinga
noted that games were set apart as not-seriousness because of their separation from the real
world and its concerns, yet also that games were able to inspire absolute seriousness during
play.55 One of Train’s strengths is its ability to contrast with the space around in it, in much
the same way that it conceptually contrasts with the mainstream game industry. Passersby
watch Train in play, a public context that adds to the game’s sense of unease and trepidation.
We can select three broad lenses from aesthetic theory and the philosophy of art to understand why Train succeeds so well as an artgame: the Enlightenment aesthetics of Immanuel Kant, the sociopolitical aesthetics of the Frankfurt School, and the contemporary
philosophy of art after Wittgenstein.
In The Critique of Judgment, Kant argues that there are necessary and sufficient conditions,
or “rules,” by which we can identify an artifact as belonging to the class of objects we call
“artistic.” Yet, these rules cannot be “determinate,” or derived a priori from a rational concept. This presents a problem that, for Kant, can only be solved by a “genius”:
