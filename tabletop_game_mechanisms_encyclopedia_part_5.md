rolls are typically not opposed by the defender, as in the High Number
Mechanism. The defender may get to respond, but as a separate check. For
example, in Warhammer, defending figures may be able to cancel hits by
making a Saving Roll of 3+. Performing a series of Stat Checks lengthens

118

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

the game, but also increases tension and can simplify the rules as modifiers
and other effects are localized.
Some games keep the target number the same but differentiate units by
the type of dice rolled. For example, in the 1986 Fortress America, the target
number is always a “5” or greater. But some units roll a six-sided die, some an
eight-sided die, and others a ten-sided die. This makes it easier for the player
to perform combat, as there is only one target number to remember.
In the 2012 reprint, this was simplified further by simply having “hit” or
“miss” symbols on the relevant dice, so only two sides of the six-sided die have
the Hit symbol, but four sides of the eight-sided die do. While this system
was a visual improvement, it was more opaque as to the strengths of the dice.
Players would have to examine all sides of the dice and memorize their odds,
which was fiddlier than with the target number system.
Some games combine a Stat Check with a High Score system. One example
is the miniatures game Infinity. The Infinity mechanism has each player trying
to roll below their stat using a 20-sided die, but higher than their opponent.
For example, let’s say two units are shooting at each other, and one has a skill
of 17, and the other a skill of 12. First, a player is only eligible to hit if they
roll less than or equal to their target. If only one player succeeds on the Stat
Check, that player hits their opponent. If both miss, then there is no effect.
If both hit, then the player with the higher roll (but still below the target)
succeeds and the other fails. Combining systems like this gives a compact and
fluid method for a variety of results.
Stat Checks can incorporate modifiers. The same considerations that are
discussed in High Number apply here.

Critical Hits and Failures

Description
Dice are rolled, and those exceeding a target number generate a success.
Certain rolls (typically the highest and/or lowest on the die) generate
additional success or extreme failure.

Discussion
Critical Hits (and Critical Failures) add variance to a resolution system, in essence
lengthening the “tail” of the result distribution. They also add excitement by
creating jackpot effects, similar to a slot machine. You have a pretty good idea
of what the result range may be, but Critical Hits and Failures, depending on
implementation, can give bonuses that make success possible where it normally
might not be, or add tension to an overwhelming attack.
In its standard implementation, Critical Hits double the damage of an
attack, or improve the result in other ways. However, there are several novel
uses of Critical results.
Uncharted Seas and Dystopian Wars, miniatures games from Spartan
Games, have an “exploding dice” critical system. In this system, players roll
a number of six-sided dice, and get a success on a 4 or higher. On a roll of a
6, however, the player gets two successes, and also gets to reroll those dice.
Additional 6s on the rerolls will yield additional double-successes and more
rerolls. In this system, it is theoretically possible to get any number of hits
on any attack, which can make for dramatic moments as dice are rolled and
rerolled, and successes accumulate.

120

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Warmachine/Hordes allows for a critical hit any time at least two dice in an
attack show the same result. Normally an attack is made with two dice, but
this number may be increased or decreased, naturally changing the frequency
of critical hits or removing their possibility (as in the case of a one-die attack)
without any additional rules overhead.
Advanced Squad Leader generates extra effects (both positive and negative)
on rolls of 2 or 12 on two six-sided dice. A 2 causes a Heat of Battle effect,
which may cause a hero to emerge, a unit to upgrade, or the squad to go
berserk and charge the enemy; a 12 may cause weapons to break or other
negative results, resolved by rolling on a separate chart (RES-04). These
add a lot of variety to combat results and force players to adapt to changing
circumstances.
Several games convert special symbols or excess successes (if rolling against
a target) into a type of currency that can be spent on various beneficial effects.
Sometimes called Surges, these can also give a lot of tools to the player to use
tactically, beyond simply resolving the combat. The miniatures game Malifaux
adapts this by using a card flipping system to generate random combat
strengths, but allowing special abilities to trigger if the correct suit flips.

Ratio/Combat Results Table

Description
The Attacker and Defender each total their strength. This is then expressed as
a ratio and is used to index into a Combat Results Table (CRT). A dice roll
then determines the result of the conflict.

Discussion
Pioneered in the earliest war games, the CRT has become a staple of the genre.
CRTs are typically indexed by calculating the ratio of the attacker’s strength
to the defender’s. For example, if the attacker has a strength of 8, and the
defender a strength of 4, the 2:1 column would be used, as 8 is two times 4.
Typically, these are rounded down in favor of the defender, so a 9–4 attack
would also be resolved on the 2:1 column.
Once the correct column is determined, a die is rolled to determine the final
result. In war games, this is typically some combination of force eliminations,
damage, or retreats.

122

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

The use of the CRT gives the designer a lot of control over potential results.
It is possible to have a tightly grouped range of outcomes from 1 to 6, or a wild
variation. In addition, the designer has many hooks to apply other effects.
For example, the attacker or defender strength can be modified, the final die
roll can be modified, or the column used can be shifted left or right. This
flexibility has led to its continued popularity in the wargaming community.
Designs have taken the CRT in a wide variety of directions. Squad Leader
eschews strength ratios, and simply has the column chosen by the firepower
of the attacker. It also includes a mechanism called Cowering, where if
doubles are rolled (two dice are rolled in Squad Leader), the column used is
shifted one to the left, to a weaker column. Elite troops are typically immune
to Cowering. This is a good example of the opportunities CRTs offer to
differentiate and apply various effects.
Some games have the column selected by a differential between Attacker
and Defender rather than a ratio. This has the benefit of simplicity, as division
can be confusing when the strengths get large. Differentials are less realistic,
however, as they will treat a 10–8 attack the same as a 3–1 attack. However,
if the values are bounded within a reasonable range, differential CRTs can
give a lighter feel.
Some games use charts with various conditions as the columns to resolve
Actions and random events. Down with the King has charts that players roll on
to determine the result. For example, there are separate charts for Gambling,
Seducing, and Carousing. The solitaire game B-17: Queen of the Skies includes
charts for damage from German fighters, bombing accuracy, and the result
of crew member injuries.
While charts can encapsulate a large amount of information and give a lot
of flexibility to the designer, they can be intimidating to players and tedious
to use, and are considered old-fashioned. However, in the right situations,
they can be quite useful.

Die Icons

Description
The player rolls a number of dice. Any die showing the target icon is a
success.

Discussion
This mechanism is typically a subset of High Number (RES-01) or Stat
Check (RES-02), as the number of successes ultimately reduces to one of
these. However, we are listing this as a separate mechanism due to some
subtleties in the implementation and player interaction.
The use of Die Icons has several advantages over traditional dice with
numbers on the sides. First, using an icon makes it simpler for players to
interpret the result, if they are properly chosen. Counting icons is inherently
simpler from a cognitive perspective than adding numbers or checking to see
if numbers on dice exceed certain values. This ease increases as the number
of dice rolled increases and is particularly true if the target value may vary
depending on the game situation. In this case, icons are easier to parse at a
glance, especially if they are thematic.

124

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

For example, contrast Warhammer with Memoir ’44. In Warhammer,
a player may roll four dice for an attack, looking for a 5 or higher for a
success (a 5+, in the parlance). After rolling, the player needs to look at the
dice, remembering the target number. Memoir ’44, like Warhammer, bases
the number of dice rolled on the nature of the attacking unit. The icon
that counts as a hit is based on what is being targeted. When attacking an
Infantry, each Infantry symbol counts as a hit. When attacking Armor, each
Armor symbol counts as a hit. In addition, the grenade icon always counts
as an additional hit. Since there are two infantry icons, one armor icon,
and one grenade icon on a die, an attack on infantry is equivalent to a 4+,
and an attack on armor a 5+. But the player does not need to have a chart
of those numbers or track them in any way. It is intuitively obvious to look
for the icons of what you are attacking, and just count them up. Advanced
players can understand the symbol distribution, but it is not necessary. The
die does the heavy lifting.
The distribution of icons also gives the designer fine-grained control over
possible combat outcomes and allows for multiple effects to be determined.
The Memoir ’44 dice also include a Retreat icon, which applies in conjunction
with the removal effects, allowing for a wide variety of outcomes.
A disadvantage of icons is that it is very difficult to deal with modifiers,
or other ways to modify attacks based on, for example, terrain, or different
quality forces.
Some games, like Descent, deal with this by having dice of different
qualities, relating to the power and skill of the character, weapon, armor, or
other equipment. The dice can be segregated into types like attack, defense,
knockback, special, and others, again allowing the designer fine-grained
control over possible outcomes while making it simple for the player to
interpret. They just need to see what color dice need to be rolled, and then
read off the icons to see the results.
Eclipse is a hybrid of this system, with three colors of dice representing
different powers—yellow (the weakest), orange, and red. However, Eclipse
does not use icons on the dice. Standard numeric pips are used, but with
non-standard distributions to model the varying power levels.
At the extreme end, Dragon Dice has custom dice for every single unit in
the game. The same effect can be represented by different icons for different
units. For example, Move icons may be boot prints for one creature and hoof
prints for another. Although it increases thematic immersion, having so many
icons can make it difficult for players to quickly parse results. It can also create
production challenges, and indeed, Quarriors!, the game that launched the

Resolution

125

concept of collectible dice games, struggled to find a publisher because of the
manufacturing challenge the game presented.
While they are most commonly used on dice, icons can be placed on cards
to be flipped for resolution as well. Similar considerations apply, except that
it is rare to have draws from multiple different decks the same way games like
Descent: Journeys in the Dark have players roll different dice.

Card Play

Description
Each player simultaneously or sequentially plays one or more cards. These modify
the base outcome of a conflict and allow various special abilities to apply.

Discussion
This resolution system places more control in the hands of the players. In
its simplest form, the player plays a number card to be added to the base
results, as in Cosmic Encounter. However, this can be taken in a wide variety
of directions to make combat more tactical.
Kemet resolves conflict by giving players a strength based on the units in
the battle. The players then each select a single Combat Card that modifies
the outcome. It has three values: strength bonus, shield value, and damage
caused. The strength bonus is added to the unit strength to determine the
victory, while the shield value and damage bonuses determine how many
opposing units are killed. Units are only removed based on those values, not
winning or losing the battle. Players may know they are most likely to lose,
and choose a Combat Card with little strength bonus, but high damage value,
so they destroy as many units as possible, possibly setting up for a counterattack, or even a Pyrrhic victory, should they succeed in eliminating all the
attacking forces. This type of counter-play leads to a lot of Yomi (UNC-01),
as players try to outguess their opponent’s intent.

Resolution

127

Kemet also has players exhaust Combat Cards that they use, plus one
additional card, in each battle. When all cards are exhausted, they are
recovered, similar to an Action Retrieval system (ACT-03). This gives players
more decisions to make and gives savvy players the opportunity to track
which Combat Cards may still be in play for their opponents.
A variety of other games allow players to play cards that modify the battle in
more extreme ways. Starship Samurai allows each player to include one battle card,
the effects of which may range from a simple strength addition, to the ability to
redeploy units into or out of the battle, changing the situation drastically. Magic:
The Gathering and other collectible card games (CCGs) use card-based Interrupts
(TRN-17) to allow for a wide variety of different effects.
Card systems can get quite complex. We the People has players draw a hand of
tactics cards to resolve battles, the size of which is based on a variety of factors,
including strength. Players then alternate playing or matching an opponent
play. The first player who is not able to match the opponent loses the battle, so
the player with more cards will typically win, but not always, and seizing the
ability to lead the card play becomes a critical tactic. In Starcraft: The Board
Game, players have a small hand of cards that have abilities that trigger based
on the units involved in the battle. As in We the People, players alternate card
play to gain an advantage. Starcraft allows players to purchase upgraded tech
cards to shuffle into their combat decks, but there is no guarantee they will be
available, leading to opportunities for bluffing (UNC-01).
The disadvantage of the more sophisticated card-based systems is that they
slow down play quite a bit as battles are resolved. In a two-player game,
this may not be an issue, but it is a consideration with higher player counts.
Nonetheless, these systems can offer enormous design opportunities, and the
ability to model a wide range of thematic moments and stratagems, as a play
of War of the Ring will demonstrate.

Rock, Paper, Scissors

Description
There are three possible options, and they are cyclically superior (A beats B,
B beats C, and C beats A).

Discussion
Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) is one of the core resolution mechanisms. Unlike
High Number or Stat Check, it is intransitive. A transitive relationship
means that if A beats B and B beats C, then A beats C. For example, simply
comparing strengths leads to a transitive relationship.
Adding intransitive elements to conflict resolution leads to interesting and
novel decisions for the players. For example, many Napoleonic wargames
treat the relationship between infantry, cavalry, and artillery as intransitive.
Infantry beats cavalry (defending in a square), cavalry beats artillery, and
artillery beats infantry. Note that “beats” in this context means “has an
advantage over.” It does not typically mean wins 100% of the time. Age of
Mythology: The Board Game is an example of this type of system.
There are a variety of ways to implement an RPS-based resolution system.
Some games, like Secret Labyrinth and Darkover, have players secretly select
one of three options (literally, RPS in the case of Secret Labyrinth), reveal,
and compare. Others will give bonuses or penalties to players based on their
choices, such as a modifier in a High Number system (RES-01), varying the
number of dice to be rolled, or changing or adding target icons.

Resolution

129

One system that is infrequently used is Intransitive Dice. In this
implementation, there are three different dice with varying values on the
faces. These are mathematically designed so that, on average, die A will roll
higher than die B, die B higher than die C, and die C higher than die A.
Typically the advantage is around 55–45, so it can be difficult to engineer a
dominant advantage, but over the course of many rolls the player that gets
the best matchups will come out ahead.
The RPS mechanism can also arise indirectly from the interaction of player
choices. For example, in Hoity Toity, players who go to the Auction House
may choose to play a Cash card, to buy an artifact; a Thief, to steal a Cash
card; or a Detective, to catch a Thief. Similarly, in Nobody But Us Chickens,
players can play a Chicken for points, a Fox to catch a Chicken, or a Dog to
catch a Fox. If there are more than three players, the interactions and choices
can get complex for players to decide, while being easy to resolve.
Hoity Toity has the additional wrinkle that if multiple players select Thief,
they cancel out, which has shades of the Prisoner’s Dilemma (RES-08) and
Sealed Bid with Cancellation (AUC-05).
Many games extend a hierarchical system by including a wrap-around
with the weakest piece defeating the strongest. For example, in Stratego, the
Marshall is the strongest piece, but it can be defeated by the Spy, the weakest.
Similarly, in Frank’s Zoo the Elephant is the strongest card, but it is defeated
by the Mouse. This adds a beneficial layer of uncertainty to these games.
Stratego without the possibility of losing your Marshall would be a much
poorer game.

Prisoner’s Dilemma

Description
Each player has a choice between Cooperating or Defecting. Total payoff
is maximized if both players Cooperate, but if one Defects and the other
Cooperates, the Defector will score more individual points.

Discussion
The Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) is one of the core Resolution mechanisms.
Players choose to either cooperate with each other, or defect. A typical payoff
chart is shown in the diagram above. Since the payoffs if both defect or both
cooperate are equivalent for both players, this system only works if there
are more than two players, even if only two are involved in the PD. If there
are only two players, neither gains ground if they select the same option, so
picking Defect is always the correct strategy.
As indicated by the traditional choice names of Cooperate and Defect,
the PD brings elements of trust to the forefront, and strong elements of Yomi

Resolution

131

(UNC-01). This can lead to emotional investment by the players, or reaction
to being betrayed, particularly in longer games where the outcome can have
a significant impact on player position.
An example of this is Diplomacy, a 6–8 hour game of conquest in Europe.
The players representing Austria and Italy start with two key spaces and
armies, Venice and Trieste, adjacent to each other at the start of the game, the
only such situation among the seven players. In Diplomacy, players write down
orders and reveal them simultaneously (TRN-09, for more on Simultaneous
Action Selection). After the initial negotiation phase, Italy and Austria need
to decide if they will move away from their common border (Cooperate)
or invade (Defect). If both Cooperate, it can set them up for a reasonable
start and good long-term relationship. If both Defect, no one loses a home
supply center, but it will sow distrust and put them behind the other players
as their forces will not have moved. And if one Cooperates and the other
Defects, a home supply center will be lost, putting one player at a significant
disadvantage.
While Diplomacy frequently creates high emotional moments like this,
the Prisoner’s Dilemma does not always need to involve such high stakes. For
example, in Hoity Toity, players in the Auction House may choose to purchase
an item, play a Thief card to steal money, or a Detective card to catch a thief.
While this is fundamentally an RPS mechanic (RES-07), if multiple players
choose Thief, they cancel out and no thieves gain any benefit. This adds
elements of a PD, but in a lighter way as there is no negotiation in Hoity Toity,
and for players the stakes are much lower.
Another example of this is Incan Gold, where each turn players need to
decide simultaneously if they are continuing to explore an abandoned temple
in search of treasure or will return home. Sometimes earlier treasure and
artifacts may be left behind players, to be scooped up by players who leave
the cave. In particular, artifacts create a PD, as they are only gained if a single
player chooses to leave the temple. If multiple players leave the cave on the
same turn, none gain the artifacts. This implementation also tends to be light
as there are potential benefits for both staying and leaving, and no negotiation
prior to selection.
Cosmic Encounter introduces the PD through Negotiation cards. Conflict
is resolved by both attacker and defender selecting a Number card from their
hand. The player with the highest Number card plus Force strength wins
the battle. Players also have the option to play a Negotiate card, if they have
one, instead of a Number card. If both players Negotiate, they are allowed
to negotiate a deal, which can be mutually beneficial. However, if only one

132

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Negotiates, that player automatically loses, and the player and their allies
lose all their involved forces. In an interesting twist, the player who chose a
Negotiate card in this situation gains a small compensating benefit, but not
Allies. Thus, inviting Allies to join you in a battle where you know you will
play a Negotiate is its own form of Defection, building a secondary PD into
the core mechanism.
Dead Last has two players dividing up four loot cards, and adds a third
option to the classic PD. In addition to Share and Steal (Cooperate/Defect),
players may also choose Grab One, which guarantees exactly one loot card,
possibly leaving three for the opponent.

Alternate Removal

Description
The player with fewer units removes one. Then players alternate removing
units until reaching a set number, one player is out of units, or some other
stopping mechanism.

Discussion
The system of Alternate Removal was first introduced in the 1980 game
Civilization. Conflict in Civilization only needs to be resolved if the total
number of tokens in an area exceeds its carrying capacity (representing
the fertility of the particular area), which ranges from 1 to 5. If the total
quantity exceeds this, the Alternating Removal process is initiated. Tokens
are removed, starting with the player with the fewest, until the total number
of tokens no longer exceeds the carrying capacity.
If players have equal numbers of tokens, the tied players each remove a
token at the same time.
This system has a variety of intriguing features. First, it is strictly
deterministic. It is a determinative process with no hidden information. This

134

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

is rare among conflict resolution mechanisms. Second, coexistence in an area
is allowed and common. Many games with conflict or battles for areas only
permit a single player to ultimately occupy an area or control it in the case
of Area Majority games (ARC-02). This gives more flexibility for players to
negotiate and settle borders.
Finally, it gives the design hooks for special abilities later in the game. For
example, if only one player in a Conflict has Metal Working, they are always
the last to remove a token.
Inis uses a similar removal system, except that players have the option of
removing a unit or discarding a card. In addition, players have the option,
after taking a casualty, to withdraw from the battle rather than pursue the
conflict. Notably, this doesn’t trigger a retreat from the disputed territory.

Physical Action

Description
A Physical Action needs to be performed by one or more players to determine
the outcome of the action.

Discussion
The most common type of Physical Action used for this type of resolution
is “flicking” a puck or disc towards a target zone. Catacombs uses flicking
for almost all resolutions. Heroes are represented by discs and are flicked to
move through the dungeon. When firing arrows or fireballs, smaller discs
are placed on the board and flicked towards the enemy to resolve the attack.
Ascending Empires and Seal Team Flix also have players flick on a map of the
playing surface to resolve actions. Space Cadets has an abstract target board
that determines whether the target is hit and the amount of damage.
Adding a physical element, like flicking, makes for an intuitive, tense, and
exciting play experience by adding Performance Uncertainty (Chapter 6). It
is somewhat skill-based, but also acts as a randomizer. However, its use does
give a game a lighter feel, as it can give a “toy” feel, as players interact with
the game pieces. In a highly strategic game, this can lead to a disconnect,
as the strategy is undercut by what can feel like a highly variable resolution
mechanism. It also can make players that are poor at performing the activity
feel like they are at a disadvantage throughout the game, and it is not
something that they can compensate for, leading to a negative experience.

136

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

While flicking is a popular implementation of a physical resolution
mechanism, there are a wide variety of alternatives. Flip Ships has a form of
flicking, with a ship being placed on a platform and flipped off of it. Dungeon
Fighter has players bounce a die off the table surface to land on a target.
Wallenstein introduced the Cube Tower. This is a tower with internal
ledges. Players resolve a conflict by taking a specific number of cubes of
different colors (the attacking and defending cubes, for example), and throw
them into the tower. The cubes that emerge at the bottom determine the
outcome. Cubes that get stuck inside are left behind and may emerge in future
conflicts. If a player knows he or she has many cubes stuck in the tower, he or
she may be more inclined to initiate conflicts, for example.
Stacking is used in a variety of games, including Junk Art, Animal Upon
Animal, and Bausack. Typically, in these games, the stacking is the core of
the game. It does not tell the player the outcome of some other action, like a
combat, but instead determines whether the player stays in the game or not
or is eliminated. However, Meeple Circus is a stacking game in which players
create their own stacks, attempting to include specific pieces in different
configurations to qualify for both private and public goals (VIC-11).
Other games have objects being removed, like Ker-Plunk and Don’t Break
the Ice. There are also games that combine removal with stacking, including
Jenga and Villa Paletti.
Finally, there are a variety of outlier physical mechanics, including
throwing darts in Dart Wars, distinguishing items by feel in Space Cadets,
egg-removal in Gulo Gulo, the pie launcher of Pie Face, finger gymnastics of
Climb!, and popping balloons in Kamasutra. A comprehensive listing of these
is far beyond the scope of this book.
Another variation on physical resolution is Speed Matching. Cards
(typically) are flipped up, and players need to see if two match, and either slap
the cards or grab a totem. Games that incorporate this type of system include
Jungle Speed and Scan. The inclusion of a physical action can give players an
opportunity to feint and induce a mistaken grab by other players, leading to
a penalty in some games. Jungle Speed incorporates this tactic.
Introducing a physical action gives the designer a chance to add physical
handicaps to mix up the challenges and make them harder. It also ups the
“zaniness” factor, giving games a lighter feel. Dungeon Fighter has players
act with their non-dominant hand, eyes closed, and various other physical
challenges.

RES-11

Static Capture

Description
Pieces are captured when another piece occupies or passes over their space.

Discussion
This is one of the oldest conflict resolution mechanisms, going back thousands
of years.
Typically combined with a movement system, a token is affected in some way
when another enters its space. For example, it may be captured (Chess, Checkers),
sent back to start (Parcheesi, Trouble, Sorry!, Backgammon) or switch sides (Shogi).
In order to make capturing challenging and meaningful, the movement
of pieces needs to be restricted in some fashion. Chess and Shogi allow pieces
to move to defined squares, while the Parcheesi family of games uses a
randomizer and the moved piece must, typically, move the full amount. More
information about Movement schemes is in Chapter 10, but a few features
are worth noting here.
In most cases, the moving piece will make the capture on its final space of
movement. This is particularly true of games where movement is controlled
by a randomizer, with pieces typically needing to land on an opposing piece
by exact count to make a capture. There are exceptions, of course. Sorry!

Resolution

139

has specific areas where a piece may slide through multiple spaces, sending
all pieces encountered back to start, and in Checkers pieces make jumps to
capture, and can string together multiple jumps as a single move.
Motion is not a requirement for this mechanism. Through the Desert allows
players to claim Palm Trees for points by extending a chain of camels across
the board. Camels do not move once placed, but players may only add to
chains in certain ways. Expedition has a similar chain mechanism, as players
attempt to “capture” certain cities on the board to earn points.
Tash Kalar: Arena of Legends has players placing pieces on the board, trying
to achieve certain patterns. When those patterns are realized, enemy pieces
may be captured.
While not truly Static Capture, there are games that feature pushing as
a means to capture, including Abalone. In these games, there are typically
restrictions on which pieces can move and be captured. In these games, pieces
or groups of pieces may push other pieces, typically with the intention of
pushing them off the board or into a dead space. Because of the physical
nature of pushing, particularly chain pushing, the physical design of the
board and pieces usually facilitates the mechanism. Abalone has a grooved
board that makes it easy to push marbles in the six hexagonal directions.

Enclosure

Description
Players are trying to surround pieces or key areas.

Discussion
Dating back thousands of years, Go is one of the most famous examples of
this type of conflict resolution. If a group of connected stones has no empty
spaces adjacent to it, it is captured. While the stones themselves are static, the
evolution of groups gives Go a dynamic feel.
Reversi implements Enclosure by allowing players to flip tiles of the
opposing color that are between two tiles of their own color.
The nature of Enclosure games makes certain regions of the board more
or less desirable. In Reversi the corner and edge spaces are more valuable, as
it is harder or impossible to surround pieces located there. Similarly in Go,
players typically start near corners, where it is easier to enclose territory and
make stones safe, and then extend down the sides and towards the middle.
Elements of Enclosure games can also be seen in games like Samurai,
where the objective is to surround board elements with tiles. These are both
Enclosure games and a type of Area Majority (ARC-02), where tiles can be

Resolution

141

placed so that they are adjacent to multiple objectives, contributing strength
towards both.
In general, good enclosure games are designed so that pieces are both
trying to enclose and at risk of being enclosed themselves, or there are several
possible ways they can be used for Enclosure.

Minimap

Description
When a conflict is initiated, pieces are moved to a separate board for resolution.

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanic, as it is a way of organizing conflict, and relies on
one of the other methods discussed here to actually resolve individual attacks.
One of the earliest examples of the Minimap mechanism is the 1962
game Bismarck. In this naval game, players secretly move task forces around
a search board. When they discover each other, task forces are moved to the
Battle Board, where the conflict is actually resolved (through a Stat Check
mechanism in Bismarck’s case). It is like “zooming in” on the battle to get
more tactical. Video games like Master of Orion and Heroes of Might and
Magic implement a similar system.
The Battle Board was later extended in Titan, where players move groups
of monsters (Legions) around a master board. When two opposing Legions
meet in the same space, they are transferred to a battle board to actually fight
the battle. Titan is notable in that it has a different battle board for each type
of terrain, and the side the defender sets up on depends on the direction from
which the attacker entered the space. This makes battles extremely variable
and tactical.

Resolution

143

A much simpler version of this mechanism is used in Axis & Allies, which
uses a Battle Board not to give tactical options to the players, but as a player
aid to help organize and keep track of the strength of units, what they need
to roll to hit, and which units are still able to fire. This is more of a graphic
design technique than a mechanism. A similar system is seen in many Force
Commitment games (ARC-06).
A variation on this can be seen in Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century,
which has both a solar system map and separate maps for each planet,
co-located on the board. Unlike Titan, which has many, many Jungle spaces,
all of which resolve on the Jungle board, here the planet maps are very specific
to the planets in the solar system, and act as a place for units on the planet to
be located, and for ground battles to be resolved.

RES-14

Force Commitment

Description
The players select how many of their forces they will commit to the battle to
different categories. The players then reveal their assignments, and resolve.

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanic that builds on other Resolution means. Typically,
players will reveal their strengths in different categories, with the High
Number gaining the benefit (RES-01). If the allocation portion of this
mechanism is done secretly, it is a Sealed Bid Auction, so considerations noted
in that section (AUC-05) apply here.
In one of the earlier implementers of this system, Dune, and its successor
Rex: Final Days of an Empire, have players allocating to just two categories:
in the battle or out of the battle. Units that a player commits to a battle
will be lost. In addition, all units from the loser are eliminated. This system
makes the players evaluate giving themselves a higher chance to win (by
committing larger forces), versus preserving as much of their force as possible,
by committing fewer forces.

Resolution

145

Dune augments the mechanism by allowing the players to also commit
leaders and bonus cards along with forces. This uncertainty is critical for this
system to work, so that the player with the larger force cannot just bid one
more than the size of the smaller.
A modified form of this system has the loser only losing part of its force,
not the full force. This makes the decision of Force Commitment for the
larger side more challenging, as it introduces more Yomi (UNC-01) by giving
a broader possible strength range of the commitment of the smaller force.
Cry Havoc and Rising Sun give more options to players for Force allocation.
In Cry Havoc, players may allocate forces to take control of the area being
fought over, cause casualties, or take prisoners. Control and Prisoners are
executed by the player with the most forces in that region, while Cause
Casualties is executed by all players who have units there. Tactics cards can
also be played to affect the battle in various ways.
Rising Sun has a similar system to Cry Havoc, except with slightly different
assignment options (the ability to sacrifice your own units for victory points,
for example). Also, while Rising Sun uses the same simultaneous secret
assignment of forces, Cry Havoc has the Attacker allocate first, followed by
the Defender. Secret assignment emphasizes the guessing nature and leads to
a lighter, more random feel, while sequential assignment removes luck, but
may give an advantage to the side that places last (the Defender, in the case
of Cry Havoc).
These types of systems give the players a lot of flexibility in the goals they
want to achieve in a battle. Are they trying to hold ground? Cause losses?
Earn points? The player can use the options to pursue a variety of strategies.

Voting

Description
Players vote on whether a proposed action will occur or not.

Discussion
The Voting mechanism is often used in games with a political theme, although
some, like Die Regeln Wir Shon, are more abstract. In some games, each player
gets one vote. In others, players may have multiple votes that they can apply.
Voting is in many ways an Area Majority mechanism (ARC-02), except
that players are either on the “Yay” or “Nay” sides, rather than only able to
win something individually. This can lead to shifting coalitions of players on
either side of an issue, as interests align and diverge, underscoring the political
nature of this resolution means.
The item being voted on can fit at various levels in the game. In Junta,
players are voting on whether the budget proposed by El Presidente passes,
and the money distributed to the players. This is an example of a sub-system
of the game that links to other key mechanisms. The Republic of Rome is
similar in that players are voting on which characters should gain offices, how
wars are conducted, and even execution of characters. These decisions then
feed into other systems to propel the game forward.
Some games have players vote on actual changes to the rules themselves.
Democrazy and Das Regeln Wir Shon are the prime examples of this, as
players play cards that contain possible game rules, and players vote on them.

Resolution

147

Proposing rules that help several players, including yourself, but yourself a
little bit more, is a key skill in the game, and can lead to intriguing and
exciting game play. These rules changes range from what actions are available
to players, how resources can be exchanged, how the game ends, and what
contributes towards victory.
Galactic Destiny, which includes a Galactic Senate mechanism, also has
players vote on new rules to be added, but these are not the core of the game.
They impact what actions players may perform, and what is legal or illegal.
As mentioned earlier, some voting games, like Das Regeln Wir Shon, give
one vote to each player, and a simple majority wins. However, there are other
variations. In Junta and Republic of Rome, the players represent factions, and
so they may have control of various characters or blocks of voters that give
them more than one vote. If players are powerful enough, they may even be
able to pass anything they want.
Some games vary from simple majority in votes. In Article 27: The UN
Security Council Game, a unanimous vote is required for a measure to pass.
Bribery and other inducements are encouraged to get players to vote your way.
While voting systems can be dynamic and interesting, they also encourage
negotiation, which can make this mechanism very time consuming. This
should be carefully considered by the designer when determining if it is
appropriate for the player experience desired.

Player Judge

Description
One player, the judge, decides the outcome of the Action.

Discussion
The standard use of this resolution mechanism is in games where players are
performing a task, and there is no objective criteria as to which is best, so one
player acts as Judge to select the winner. For example, in Apples to Apples, one
player is the Judge, and the other players select one of their noun cards to
match an adjective card. The Judge then selects which they think is closest.
Similarly, in The Big Idea, players use noun cards to pitch products that
fulfill a need, and the Judge selects which they like the most.
In these games, the role of Judge either rotates around the table in a regular
fashion, or passes to the player who won the last round. The latter is a type
of balancing mechanism as the Judge usually cannot score, so it gives other
players an opportunity to close the gap (VIC-18).
This Player Judge mechanism allows players to tailor their answers to the
Judge, and what their preferences might be. The best implementations of this
system have anonymous responses, as in Apples to Apples. In games where it
is known which player goes with which answer, the Judge may go against
the spirit of the game, and deliberately not select players due to their score,
rather than the intrinsic worth of their submission. Personal relationships that
are outside of the game may also impinge (like someone giving preferential
treatment to a spouse). While this mechanism is typically used in lighter games,

Resolution

149

so this may not be that much of an issue, it is still a consideration, particularly
when playing with children who may be more emotionally involved.
Some games, like Say Anything, sidestep this issue by having the players bet
on which answer the Judge will select. This makes it impossible for the Judge
to game the system and keeps players more involved in the game.

Targeted Clues

Description
A player gives clues that he or she wants some, but not all, players to guess.

Discussion
This resolution mechanism is often used in party games, or lighter social
games. The core idea is that one player is giving clues to the group about,
typically, a word or phrase, and the other players try to guess the answer.
However, it is bad for the clue-giver if either no players guess correctly, or if
all players guess correctly. The player scores the most points when some of the
players guess correctly, but not all.
For example, in Barbarossa, players make small clay sculptures to represent
something—a lion, for example. If no one guesses that it is supposed to be
a lion, or if everyone does, the sculpting player does not score. They need
to make a sculpture that is somewhere between obvious and obscure. Dixit
operates similarly but with pictures.
Decrypto is a variation on this idea. The players are broken up into two
teams. One team has a list of four words that all players on the team can
see. The clue giver needs to give a clue that will allow their team to select the

Resolution

151

right word from the list. The other team can hear those clues but does not see
the word list. Over several rounds, players need to give multiple clues for the
same word, and if the other team can figure out the word or concept, they can
win. Thus, clues need to be given that are straightforward enough for your
team to get it, without the opposing team figuring it out.

Tie-Breakers

Description
If a resolution results in a tie, players look to an alternate means to break it.

Discussion
While we include this in Resolution, this is a meta-mechanic that can apply
to Victory, Auctions, and many other mechanisms. While there are a wide
variety of tie-break mechanisms, they typically fall into one of these categories:
• Resource: The player with the most or least of a particular resource will
break the tie. For example, in Trade on the Tigris, if the score is tied
at the end of the game, the game is won by the player with the fewest
Barbarian tokens. If these are also tied, the win goes to the player with

Resolution

153

the most Culture tokens. In a two-player game this resource may take
the form of a Priority token, with the player holding the Priority token
breaking the tie, and then passing the token to their opponent. This is
similar to the Possession arrow in basketball.
• Positional: The player in a specific position in the turn order, or on a
track, will break the tie. A common tie-breaker is for the player who
is closest to the First Player will break the tie. As another example, in
Rising Sun, the player who is higher on the Honor track wins the tie.
In conflict games that use dice to resolve, ties will go to the defender.
Risk works this way, for example. If the defender rolls a 6, they will win
regardless of what the attacker rolls. Most often ties go to the defender,
but in some games that want to encourage aggression, ties may go to
the attacker.
• Random: Players roll off or use some other randomization means to
