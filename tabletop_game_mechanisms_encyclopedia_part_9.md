a level of randomness that may or may not match the design intent, and player
expectation. Designers also need to realize that players are poor judges of
what is a normal “streak” in a game like this and will perceive their frequency
as worse than average even when they are exactly as expected. The Catan
Event Cards expansion introduces a deck of 36 cards featuring each of the
different possible outcomes of a roll of 2d6. A reshuffle card sits 5 cards from
the bottom, indicating when the deck is to be reshuffled. Whether this is an
improvement or not is largely in the eyes of the beholder, and the designer.

Investment

Description
Players own a share of an entity.

Discussion
Typically, this Investment mechanism represents ownership in the form
of stock. Players may buy shares of stock and accrue benefits based on the
amount of stock owned.
The benefits take two basic forms. In the simplest, players earn a dividend
based on the number of shares owned. This may occur periodically, or at
specific trigger points. Other systems give benefits to the player who owns
the most shares, or to the top shareholders. This is very similar to an Area
Majority system (ARC-02), so the considerations there apply.
Often it is a combination of these two. In Acquire, for example, players
buy shares in hotel chains, which grow during the game, and merge if they
touch. When a chain merges, each share pays a set amount, with the top two
shareholders earning special bonuses.
In Airlines, scoring happens at variable intervals based on Card Draw
(CAR-04). Each airline awards points based on the number of flight paths
it has claimed on the board. The player with the most gains 1 victory point
(VP) per flight path, and the player with the second-most gains half of that.

Economics

269

The parallels with Area Majority are clear, as having one more share than
your opponent is just as good as owning 100% of the shares. The number of
shares that are available is usually limited. In Airlines it varies by company,
so players can lock in a guaranteed majority by having, for example, 4 shares
in a 7-share company. This is distinct from the typical Area Majority game,
where players can put as many resources as they like into a single entity. This
distinctive mechanism is sometimes referred to as Area Control.
Another instructive example in Airlines is the way values change for different
airlines. Each has a different number of markers that can be placed on the
map to claim more routes. Airlines with more shares have more markers.
This makes them potentially more valuable, but players must do more to gain
and have the most shares. See Connections (VIC-14) and Network Building
(SET-04) for further discussion.
An analogous but different form of Investment is Contribution. Players
who contribute to a particular effort are entitled to a share of the spoils. For
example, in Tobago, players contribute clues to narrow down the location of
a treasure. When it is located, players who contributed clues to the correct
location earn a reward. In Dragon’s Gold, players cooperate to slay a dragon,
and players who participate (no matter to what degree) are entitled to
participate in the negotiations to divide the treasure.

Ownership

Description
Players own entities, and perform actions for those entities, or collect benefits
if others use them.

Discussion
In Le Havre and Caylus, players may build buildings, which become new
action spaces that all workers can use (see “Worker Placement” in Chapter 9
for more details). Typically, the owner can use the space free-of-charge, but
when other players use the space, they must pay a fee to the owner.
This type of Ownership mechanism introduces a lot of different value
calculations for the player. If I invest in this building, is it attractive enough
that other players will use it and I will recoup my investment? If I take
advantage of a building owned by another player, will it benefit my opponent
more than me? As such, this mechanism can create a lot of player interaction.
In many rail games, including Empire Builder, Railway Rivals, and Rail
Baron, players may use tracks built by other players for a fixed cost. This leads
to decisions about how often a player may need to take a certain route in the
future and rent-vs.-buy calculations.
A more advanced form of Ownership is featured in 1830, 18xx games
more generally, Imperial, and more. In these games, players purchase shares
in companies (or countries in the case of Imperial), and the player with the
most shares is the executive owner and has the ability to take actions on
behalf of that entity. In 1830 players can build track and stations, buy trains,

Economics

271

and decide whether or not to issue dividends. In Imperial players may build
armies or navies, declare war on other countries, or build up their economy.
Typically, the money and assets of the company belong to the company.
Players have their own money and assets, and these are strictly separate. There
are specific means by which players can profit from running the company, not
all of which are to the benefit of the company or the other shareholders. Like
in real-world business, there are many strategies for enrichment, and these
games offer a high level of complexity and steeper learning curves.
If a player obtains more shares than the current owner, they take over
Ownership. This can lead to major shifts in board state. While owners usually
don’t like to lose their position, it can sometimes be an important tactic,
particularly in the 18xx series of games. In those, the corporations, which
represent railroad companies, must have trains. When trains become obsolete,
they are discarded, and new ones must be purchased. If the railroad does
not have enough money, the owner must pay for new trains out of pocket.
An important tactic is for the owner to drain money out of the company
treasury and then dump their shares to stick the almost-bankrupt company
with another player.
Greed Incorporated is also based around this idea, as the key strategy in
this game is getting Ownership of a company, getting it pay you bonuses, and
bailing out before it goes under.
Ownership of this type makes a game multilevel. Players need to consider
the individual player positions within companies, the companies’ positions
on the board, and the relative strengths and cash positions of all.

Contracts

Description
Players fulfill Contracts to earn rewards.

Discussion
Typically to complete a Contract, players turn in a specific combination of
goods and earn a reward, which is usually money or victory points (VPs).
Contracts can either be public or private. Public Contracts are face-up
and shared by all players who race to fulfill it first. Often the Contract is
discarded, but sometimes other players can fulfill the Contract later for a
lesser reward. Century: Spice Road is an example game with Public Contracts.
Private Contracts, by contrast, may only be fulfilled by the player that has
them. They may be known to all or kept hidden until fulfilled. In Empire
Builder, players have three Contract cards to deliver a specific good at a
specific city. These are face-up so all players can see them, but only the owner
may complete the delivery.
There are a variety of ways that players may obtain Contracts. They may be
obtained via random draw (as in Empire Builder or Century: Spice Road), by
selecting from a tableau, by drawing several and selecting which to keep and
which to discard, by draft, or even by auction (as in Mow Money).
Contracts give players immediate direction and goals, which can be
particularly important for new players. Public Contracts increase player
interaction, but also may lead to “feel-bad” moments if a player is really
close to completing a Contract but is scooped by an opponent at the last

Economics

273

second—particularly if 2nd place rewards aren’t available. In these cases, it is
helpful if whatever is used to fulfill the Contract is generally useful, so that
the effort to acquire that specific set of resources, or bring them to a specific
location, is not completely wasted.

Bribery

Description
Players offer bribes to other players to get them to perform specific actions.

Discussion
Bribery is a subset of the Trading mechanism (ECO-02); however, it is
typically more structured and given a different thematic basis. In a Bribery
mechanism, a player needs to make a decision, and the other players then
make monetary offers to entice the active player to make a particular choice.
Santiago uses this mechanism to great effect. Players are constructing
irrigation canals around fields. Each turn, one player is the overseer, and needs
to decide where they will be constructed. The other players may influence the
decision by laying a stick of their color in the direction they prefer, along with
some coins. If the overseer decides to build in a way that contains another
player’s bribe, they take it. However, they are free to build in a completely
different direction than any of the bribers would like. Bribes that are not
taken are returned to the players.
This system rewards players that are able to judge where the overseer may
want to build anyway, and also gives the overseer opportunity for bluff,
convincing the other players that the overseer wants to build in a different
direction than they truly do, to entice other players to place bribes where they
were planning to go anyway. The overseer also needs to value the benefit of a
particular build to their opponent, as opposed to the bribe that they would
receive.
While Bribery usually involves one active player and many potential bribers,
Tonga Bonga implements a multiplayer simultaneous bribe system. Players
have sailor tokens, but they cannot staff their own ships. Their sailors must be
sent to other players’ ships. At the start of each round, players place bribes on
different positions around those ships. Then, in sequence, each player places

Economics

275

a sailor on an available space, potentially gaining the bribe there. Sailors have
different ratings, and a higher-rated sailor can kick out a lower-rated sailor
from a position—a kind of Auction or Area Majority mechanism (ARC-02).
After all sailors have been placed, players gain coins on their spaces.
Players need to balance gaining coins, versus sending their best sailors
to help their opponents move their ship, which ultimately is the way to win
the game. Money is only a means towards an end and does not yield direct
victory points.
Sheriff of Nottingham uses Bribery as a one-on-one mechanism. Players are
trying to bring goods into the city and need to declare what they are bringing
in to the Sheriff, who is played by a different player each round. Players place
the cards they wish to get into the city in a sealed pouch, and must declare
the contents to the Sheriff, truthfully or not. The Sheriff has to decide whether
to inspect the bag or not. If the player was lying, the Sheriff gains, if not, the
player gains. Before the Sheriff decides to inspect or not, the player may offer
a bribe for them to not inspect, which can lead to interesting negotiations
and Yomi (UNC-01).

Increase Value of Unchosen Resources

Description
If players do not select certain Actions or Resources, then they increase in
value.

Discussion
Puerto Rico is one of the earliest examples of this mechanism. Each player
selects one role during a round, but there are more available roles than players.
The roles that are not chosen gain a coin at the end of each round. In the
future, when a players select that role they also gain the coins on it. This
mechanism is a specific type of Dutch Auction (AUC-08).
Small World and Century: Spice Road also implement this system in a
different guise. When a players select a new faction in Small World, they
select it from a queue. They may take any available faction in the queue but
must place a coin on each one that they skip over.
In Agricola, a worker placement game (Chapter 9), some spaces are stocked
with an addition resource each turn. If those spaces are not selected, they will

Economics

277

accumulate more and more resources, until a player claims them and takes all
the resources on the space.
These systems all have in common that they allow the players to value
the choices. The value of unselected options gradually increases, until the
value reaches a point that entices a player to choose it. While this doesn’t
eliminate the need for the designer to balance options, it gives some flexibility
to price options that have values that may change over the course of the game
or are random combinations that vary in power (as in Small World).

Negotiation

Description
Players make agreements about courses of action.

Discussion
Negotiation as a mechanism is very similar to Trading (ECO-02). We are
drawing a distinction here between the exchange of resources, which defines
Trading, and the influencing of actions that people take, usually in exchange
for a promised action by the negotiating player. Bribery (ECO-16) combines
these, exchanging resources for an action. The dividing line here is certainly
fuzzy, but useful.
Negotiation games often include deals that are non-binding. Diplomacy is a
classic example. Players can discuss and coordinate moves, but nothing in the
game binds players to follow through when they secretly write their orders.
Designers may include rules that mandate binding Negotiations. Typically,
these require that the terms of the deal be resolved immediately, and not

Economics

279

extend to future turns or actions. This is a practical matter, as it becomes
difficult to remember what the negotiated deal terms were and eliminates the
need to include rules for what happens of the agreed-upon action physically
cannot be performed.
Non-binding deals raise the emotional stakes for many players, because
they raise questions of honesty and loyalty, which are social rather than
economic norms. Negotiations can also dramatically lengthen games, and so
negotiation periods may need to be time-limited.
While any game is potentially subject to players negotiating, there are a
few techniques for designers to add it as a specific feature. One is to have
a dedicated Negotiation or discussion phase, as is done in Diplomacy or
The Resistance. The rules should contain some structure around length of
Negotiations and what is or is not binding.
Negotiation can also be encouraged through Voting (RES-15), Hidden
Roles (UNC-04) and Simultaneous Action Selection (TRN-09). These
mechanisms introduce discussion and negotiation naturally, although it
is recommended that the legality of negotiation (and again, the scope), be
referenced in the rules.
Finally, negotiation can be supported thematically. Games that are
modeling deals, or politics (like I’m the Boss or Republic of Rome) will naturally
lead to player negotiation.

Alliances

Description
Players have formal relationships that may change over the course of the
game.

Discussion
In pure Negotiation games (ECO-18), agreements to cooperate are informal
and can be made or broken at will. This mechanism differs in that there is
a formal step to enter into and leave an Alliance, and the game rules specify
how the Alliance operates.
For example, in Dune, each turn, cards are revealed from the Spice deck.
If one of them is a Worm card, the players are allowed to make and break
alliances. These alliances are in force until the next Worm card is revealed.
Players that are allied may not attack each other, combine their score for
winning purposes, win together, and may cooperate in other ways. When
the next Worm is revealed, players may decide if they want to continue the
alliance, ally with another player, or go it alone. Empires in Arms, a detailed
simulation of the Napoleonic Wars, has a robust and complex alliance system,
with a variety of possible formal relationships between players.

Economics

281

In Struggle of Empires, each Round begins with players bidding for the right
to divide the players into two teams of their choosing. Like Dune, players who
are allied fight together and may not attack each other. However, players still
win or lose individually, which creates interesting dynamics.
Cosmic Encounter has players trying to conquer planets from their
opponents. Each time this occurs, there is a formal alliance step, where players
may choose to ally with the attacker, defender, or stay out of it, and there are
defined benefits and penalties if their side wins or loses. So this is a similar
system, although it is much shorter in duration, lasting one turn.
There are a variety of other takes on this system. Through the Ages has Treaty
cards that players can offer to their opponents to gain mutual (sometimes
asymmetrical) benefits. The Trick-Taking card game (CAR-01) Mu has
partners assigned for the hand based on a bidding phase. Hidden Role games
(UNC-04) secretly put players on different teams.

Auctions

ӶӶ
A common concern in game design is how to allocate resources fairly among
players. One of the most versatile solutions is an auction. Auctions provide for
player agency, drama, interaction, strategy and calculation. They are engaging
and skill-testing, while providing players the opportunity to acquire whatever
they wish, as long as they are able to pay.
The branch of mathematics called Game Theory studies auctions
extensively, and game designers can draw on a rich trove of auction types with
widely varying dynamics. Auctions can help keep a game in balance because
players can dynamically adjust their pricing in response to fluctuations in the
value of goods in a game.
For a time, auction mechanisms were wildly popular, and Reiner Knizia,
the master of the auction, dominated the tabletop industry and the awards
circuit with a dizzying array of clever and innovative auction games. Other
genres, like 18xx, also incorporated auctions, especially on setup. Yet, over
time, the auction has waned in popularity, as Worker Placement (Chapter 9)
and Drafting Mechanisms (CAR-06) presented alternative methods for
allocating actions and resources in games.
Why did this shift occur? To some extent, gamer tastes change, like
fashion, but designers should be aware of some of the drawbacks of the auction
mechanism that contributed to its decline. Auctions depend on players being
able to make accurate valuations of the lots up for auction. As players gain
experience with a game, these assessments are easier to make, but for many
players, the first few plays can be very frustrating. Auctions are also fragile to
players who make bidding mistakes, like over-spending early. In many auction
games, one bad judgment can cripple a player for the rest of the game.

283

284

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

A challenging counterpoint to players being able to accurately judge value
is that they should not be able to judge it too accurately. As an example,
consider how much you would bid for a $10 bill. Any bid other than $10
doesn’t make sense: bid more and you’ll over-pay. Bid less, and you’ll be outbid. There needs to be some obscuring of the precise value of the lot up for
bid. Some ways to do that include hidden goals, having the values depend on
what lots may be available in the future, or a mechanism like set collection
(Chapter 12) which makes the same good have different values to different
players.
Auctions can also slow a game down quite a bit. While this isn’t a problem
when auctions are the central mechanism of the game, it can present problems
for pacing and play-time when they’re a sub-system in a bigger game.
Fortunately, there are many auction mechanics that are specifically designed
to address this challenge, and we discuss them in this chapter. Multiple-lot
auctions, simultaneous, or single-bid auctions, and auctions with substantial
constraints on bidding amounts all help make auctions work better in the
context of tabletop games.
As you read this section, you may find that many other mechanisms can be
described as a kind of auction or are isomorphic to an auction. We’ll point to
examples throughout this section that may be surprising or eye-opening. Keep
in mind, however, that the math underlying an auction, or any mechanism,
is only one piece of the puzzle. How players experience a mechanism, how it’s
presented, and the way it supports the game’s theme and setting are as much a
part of the mechanism as the underlying math. Nonetheless, auctions are like
the skeletal system of games. In many cases, it is their mathematical dynamics
and structure that support the rest of the structure.

Open Auction

Description
Players shout out bids as they will, with no turn order. While an Open
Auction will typically end when a certain amount of time with no increases
occurs, or it is clear that no one wishes to raise the current bid, a true Open
Auction allows a seller to accept any bid at any time and close the Auction.
Though the usual outcome is that the high bidder is the winner, no rule
requires this outcome.

Discussion
An Open Auction is quite unusual in that it has no auctioneer, and no rules—
not even the rule that the highest price must win. In a sense, an Open Auction
is more like an out-loud simultaneous negotiation. The reality is that very few
auctions, in the real world or in board games, are truly open. That’s because
Open Auctions are pretty messy! Multiple bidders often want to bid the same
amount, and the bidding increments can be all over the place. Some bidders
may not hear all the bids, and confusion is all too common. Without an
auctioneer, these auctions can be difficult to govern fairly. In the boardgame
context, it’s worth pointing out that they also tend to be really noisy and

286

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

frenetic. The only game we could find that uses Open Auctions is Monopoly.
In perhaps the most-overlooked rule in the game, when a player decides not to
buy a property from the bank, the property is sold at an Open Auction to any
player (including the one who chose not to buy it from the bank initially) at
any price. Given this example, designers should carefully consider whether an
Open Auction truly suits their game, or whether a different auction structure
might work better.
Despite their weaknesses, Open Auctions do have some important features.
First, iterative bidding provides a lot of information as players reveal their
preferences and for the goods up for auction. The auction integrates a means
for allocating resources with a way for players to trade opinions about how
valuable they are.
Another important feature of the Open Auction is that the dominant strategy
for any bidder is to stay in the auction until their value for the auctioned goods
is reached. This means that, absent external issues like very large disparities
in player wealth, the winner will pay a price close to the actual value for the
item—or, to be precise, they will pay one dollar (or other bidding increment)
more than the price at which the 2nd-highest bidder valued the item.
In general, Open Auctions are more theoretical than practical. There are
many small tweaks to the basic structure that create much more suitable
dynamics for use in tabletop games. We include the mechanism of Open
Auctions here to act as a basis for comparison.

English Auction

Description
An auctioneer asks for bids of a certain amount and players indicate their
willingness to bid at that amount, usually by holding up a hand or paddle, or
by calling out. Players are permitted to adjust the increment of the bid, usually
by shouting out their actual bid, though this is done infrequently, and usually
either to indicate a smaller increment than the auctioneer requests, or a much
larger one. When a certain amount of time with no increases occurs, or it is
clear that no one wishes to raise the current bid, the auctioneer declares that
the high bidder is the winner.

Discussion
The English Auction is probably what most people think of when they hear
the word “auction.” The auctioneer, at the front of the room, speaking in a
too-fast-to-follow cadence while various bidders use paddles to signal their
intent to bid in ever-increasing amounts until, at last, the “going, going,
gone!” is sounded and the winning bid is declared.
The primary differences between an English and an Open Auction are in
their governance. An English Auction employs an auctioneer to recognize
bidders, to determine which bids are valid, who the current winning bid

288

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

is, and what is the appropriate bid increment to maximize the settlement
price of the auction, while also bringing the auction to a swift conclusion.
The compensation of auctioneers in the real world suggests that these skills
are non-trivial, and that better auctioneers execute better auctions, which
produce higher prices for sellers.
For designers, the need for an auctioneer can make English Auctions
less appealing, even though the benefits they provide in terms of certainty,
fairness, and speed are substantial. Fortunately, designers can turn to a variety
of similar auctions that capture those benefits without requiring mediation—
including auctions in which the auctioneer may bid. We’ll look at those in
the next sections.
An overlooked feature of English Auctions is that the price of the auction
moves against the preferences of the bidders—that is, it goes up. While that’s
what most of us think of when we think of auctions, there are auctions in
which the price moves the other way, starting at some high number and them
moving down. See Dutch Auction (AUC-08) as an example.
English Auctions are dynamic and dramatic, but they share the core of the
open auction in that they reveal a lot of information to the bidders about one
another, and they have a weakly dominant strategy of simply staying in the
bidding until your value is reached.
There are some other strategies that bidders employ though, whose effects
are primarily psychological. Players might make a large jump in bid increment
to intimidate other bidders, or they might leave their paddle in the air (aka
“Lighthouse bidding”) to show they’re in for the long haul. Bidding quickly
and crisply is another way to demonstrate an intention to stay in the bidding
for a while. These strategies may have the desired effect of driving other players
off, but they can also inadvertently raise prices beyond what was necessary to
win the auction. Finally, a player may make a bid that is larger than her own
value for the lot in order to inflate the final settlement price of the auction.
This move can backfire, however, if no other bidder raises the bid further.
An important aspect of English Auctions, and auctions with auctioneers
more generally, is to whom the closing price is paid. In some auctions, rather
than paying the bank, the player who chooses the item up for bid receives
payment, unless they are the winner of the item, in which case payment is
made to the bank. In practice, the result of this mechanism, which is featured
in Modern Art, is that the auctioneer player, the one who put the item up for
bid, very rarely purchases it, because effectively, they pay double: the cost of
the item, and the forgone gains from letting someone else win it and collecting

Auctions

289

the payment. Thus, effectively, the player who puts the item up for bid plays as
the auctioneer, rather than an active bidder, for the duration of that auction.
The dynamic and engaging nature of English Auctions is exciting, but
designers will typically have to turn to another mechanism for implementation
at the table.

Turn Order Until Pass Auction

Description
Starting with one player and going in turn order, players may raise the current
bid or pass. When all players but one have passed, the player remaining in the
auction is the winner.
Normally players that pass may not re-enter the auction. However, allowing
re-entry is a variation that is not uncommon.

Discussion
The benefits of this Turn Order Until Pass mechanism are in its simplicity
and how it aligns with players’ expectations. Players are rarely confused by
how to run this kind of auction, so it doesn’t require an auctioneer. Popular
games, like Power Grid and Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization,

Auctions

291

feature this type of auction, and in a boardgame-adjacent space, auctions in
fantasy sports are typically of this kind, perhaps adding to the popularity and
familiarity of the mechanism.
From a game theory perspective, the dominant strategy for bidders is the
same as in an Open Auction: namely, to stay in the bidding until their value
for the item for bid is reached. This can help prevent any player from receiving
an unearned windfall simply because of the mechanics of the bidding.
Turn Order Until Pass provides a structure to govern the uncertainties that
normally exist in Open and English Auctions. A player may only bid on his
or her turn and must exceed the previous high bid. This ordered and clear
structure make it an excellent choice for board games.
Turn Order Until Pass does have some drawbacks. For one, it’s not as
dynamic as Open Auctions, as the ordered process of bidding removes some
of the energy from the auction process.
The imposition of a turn order on bidding also creates a bit of unfairness.
If the current bid is $10, and it’s not my turn, I can’t bid $11. If $11 is the
most I’m willing to pay, but the active player goes ahead and bids $11, there’s
nothing I can do. If nobody else bids, that player will win the auction at
$11 even though more than one bidder was willing to pay that amount.
In an English Auction, a skilled auctioneer will recognize when more than
one bidder is stuck on the same bid, and will cajole one or the other to raise
their bid. Failing that, the auctioneer will recognize the bid of whomever bid
first—which may not be perfectly fair either, but at least provides all bidders
with the theoretical opportunity to bid any number they wish. In a Turn
Order Until Pass Auction, by contrast, some players will simply not have the
opportunity to bid certain values.
Another issue introduced when there is no auctioneer is that an auction
can drag if players don’t increment their bids reasonably. In games where
players hold a lot of money, players incrementing their bids $1 at a time can be
painful. However, incrementing by $1 at a time is theoretically the dominant
strategy to avoid over-paying, so it’s tough to put the blame on the players for
doing so. It’s the designer’s responsibility to incentivize behavior that leads to
a better experience!
Turn Order Until Pass remains one of the easiest types of auctions to
implement, to run, and to participate in. The mechanism exists in many
different games as a relatively quick way to allocate resources or benefits.
However, games that place a central focus on the auction mechanism usually
introduce some additional twist. In recent years, Drafting (CAR-06) has
overtaken simple bidding as the preferred method for quick allocation of

292

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

resources—not least because auctions require more precise valuation by
players, which can be challenging, especially for new players. This issue is
not unique to this specific kind of auction and has been discussed at greater
length in the introduction to this section.
Re-entry after passing is a variant that allows players to pass but re-enter
the bidding when their turn comes around again. Passing is risky, in the sense
that if all but one player passes, the auction will close. However, re-entering
after passing does create some interesting drama, but at a high cost in terms
of play-time. When players pass, an auction speeds along since it has fewer
participants. When re-entry is allowed, the number of participants in the
auction never decreases. Perhaps the main advantage of allowing re-entry is
preventing accidental windfalls, by allowing a previously passed player to raise
the bid on a lot that should sell for more, but whose value is languishing for
whatever reason.

Sealed-Bid Auction

Description
Players secretly make a bid. All bids are revealed simultaneously, and the high
bidder wins.

Discussion
Sealed-Bid Auctions, also called Blind-Bid Auctions, compress all the
excitement of an auction into one tense bidding decision, followed by a big
reveal. Designers favor them for these features, as well as for their speed. In
games in which an auction is one sub-system in a larger game, or in which
there are many sequential auctions, a single sealed-bid system is perfect
for moving the game along. A good example of this is the Game of Thrones
board game, in which players run a gauntlet of three auctions in a row
every few turns. The consecutive auctions allocate special abilities among
the players, and thus must be quick and decisive, as the rest of the game
involves intricate and time-consuming planning, negotiations, and troop
movements.
Sealed-Bid Auctions sacrifice some of the informational value of other
iterative bid systems. Players who assess correctly that they will not be the

294

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

winners of an auction will often bid nothing, or perhaps a token amount, so as
to deny other players knowledge of their true valuation. This may be a feature
or a bug, depending on the intent of the designer and the needs of the design,
but is worth keeping in mind when employing this mechanism.
Sealed-bid systems typically require some type of tie-breaker, since
nothing stops players from bidding the same amount. Various tie-breaking
methods exist. In the aforementioned A Game of Thrones, one of the abilities
that players bid on is the ability to break ties—an ability that starts the game
with one of the players. Other common tie-breakers include turn order or
reverse order of current score (a kind of catch-up mechanism). Some games
feature rebidding by the tied players, like Spartacus: A Game of Blood and
Treachery, and Container. Fist of Dragonstones breaks ties through a rebid
with a special currency that is only used for that purpose. This approach is
decisive, but it lengthens the bidding process that sealed bidding is meant
to curtail.
An ergonomic consideration for sealed bidding is the componentry used
for currency. The easiest way to do sealed bidding is by placing currency in
a closed fist. Designers should carefully consider the size and material for
the currency to ensure that bids fit comfortably in most hands, that tokens
are easy to stack and pick up, and that they are at least somewhat resistant
to the palm-sweat these auctions engender. Other approaches to sealed bids
include using a dial to set a value, as in Dune, setting a die to a value, as in
Tiny Epic Kingdoms, or placing bids behind a screen, as in Modern Art.
Sealed-Bid Auctions are often used for combat resolution. In both Dune
and Tiny Epic Kingdoms, players bid military strength, which might be further
modified by other effects, to determine the victor of a military encounter.
Scythe offers a similar auction, but players bid a resource to power their mechs
rather than bidding actual troops.
Sealed bidding, more than any other type of bidding, may require losers
to pay their bids (sometimes referred to as an “all-pay” auction). This has
stronger thematic consonance when the bids represent a battle, rather than
the purchase of goods. The lost bids make sense when they represent battle
losses, but they make less sense when the bids are surrendered but no goods
are acquired in return. All-pay auctions are used in game theory to model,
among other things, elections and political contests, which perhaps makes
them more fitting for use in the Game of Thrones board game. There is a lot
of design space available in all-pay auctions, though players often express
strongly negative reactions to these auctions, so proceed with care. Note that
variants like loser-pays-half, as in For Sale (which is a turn-order auction, not

Auctions

295

a blind bid), can help remove some of the sting, while incentivizing higher
bids, ironically.

Sealed Bid with Cancellation

Description
Players secretly make a bid. All bids are revealed simultaneously, and the high
bidder wins, unless there are ties for high bidder. Tied bids cancel each other
out and are treated as the lowest bids.

Discussion
The purpose of ties cancelling out is in some sense a response to the challenge
of running auctions without an auctioneer. A skilled auctioneer can help sort
out two tied bidders and create some separation between them. Cancellation
acts as a kind of heavy-handed auctioneer who refuses to acknowledge tied
bids.
Mechanically, this type of auction works best when coupled with
constrained bids that increase the chances of ties. When players are working
from a defined and limited set of bid markers, they may have a much better
idea about what their opponents could bid. The bidding game begins to
resemble a bluffing or betting game more than a regular auction, as players
know that bidding big can’t guarantee their victory. If players are good at
tracking which markers players have already used to bid, they can deduce

Auctions

297

which low bids might actually win the auction, and which high bids are more
susceptible to cancellation. This interaction does echo real-world dynamics
in which the two strongest competitors can impede each other sufficiently to
allow a weaker competitor to emerge from the fray with the prize.
This counter-intuitive mechanism hasn’t proven especially popular over the
years. The non-thematic notion that a seller would ignore a higher bid simply
because more than one bidder made it flies in the face of economic rationalism.
As such, this is a mechanism that can feel “gamey,” or anti-thematic.
Another drawback to this mechanism is that bidders can find it quite
punishing while also feeling random. When players reveal their bids and
discover they both valued the lot really highly, but neither gets it, that can
be very frustrating.
However, this same feature can lead to fun and dramatic moments, and
increases the element of Yomi (UNC-01) for the players. As such, it works
best in lighter games with more chaos. Players looking for a highly strategic
experience will not be attracted to this mechanism.

Constrained Bidding

Description
This is a meta-mechanism that can modify other auction techniques. Players
may not bid any number that they wish. They may only bid based on
increments and/or combinations of certain resources.

Discussion
The greatest drawback of auctions as a game design mechanism is their
length. The second-biggest defect is that it is difficult for players to make
small distinctions in the value of the lots up for bid. Is some collection of
goods worth 13? 14? 15? At small increments, it can be very challenging to
make a determination.
Constrained Bidding offers a cure to both of these defects. Since there are
fewer valid bids, and the increment required to raise the bid is higher, auctions
come to a close more quickly. Players are rarely faced with the decision to
increase their bid by one or two units, and those larger increments make it
easier for players to value the lots up for bid.
One of the effects of Constrained Bidding is a reduction in the uncertainty
of auction outcomes. It’s easier for players to predict which other players
might be interested in a lot, and how they’ll bid. Some games will have

Auctions

299

bidding tokens be hidden information to retain some of the tension in
the auction.
Constrained Bidding is a favorite for designer Reiner Knizia, appearing in
designs of his, including Ra, Amun-Re and High Society. Yet it hasn’t caught
on as a generally popular auction mechanism, and designers should be aware
of some substantial drawbacks to it.
For one, Constrained Bidding, aside from the basic constraint of some
minimum bid increment, is an especially artificial device. The need to raise a
bid by a specific amount or based on the limitation of which bidding tokens
you hold doesn’t typically have any thematic justification. It’s hard to imagine
a real-world auction that would use this kind of mechanism.
Constrained Bidding also introduces a challenge in redistributing the
used bidding tokens. In most auction games, the money system is either
fixed, or based on some economy that enables you to buy and sell the goods
up for auction. But in a fixed token system, all the advantages those fixed
increments grant to speed of auction come at the cost of their non-liquidity.
Put simply, you can’t make change! Designers need to carefully consider both
the balance of initial apportionment of bid tokens and how they come back
to their owners after use.
One area in which there is still considerable design space is multiuse
bidding counters. Will you use a powerful card as currency to bid in an
auction? Or will you save its power for use in another aspect of the game?
One might see Twilight Struggle (and many other area majority games) as a
series of simultaneous auctions, with the multiuse cards representing a kind
of fixed bid. Admittedly, in Twilight Struggle, the cards, when used as action
points, are more liquid than a true Constrained Bid Auction, but it’s in the
same family.
Indeed, there is an entire category of games that are based on bidding
cards with multiple uses, often with players having duplicate decks. Libertalia
and Eggs & Empire come to mind immediately. The cards can be seen as a
kind of Constrained Bidding token, and players typically have to use each
card once before being allowed to pick up the discards. What distinguishes
these games from true auctions is twofold. First, the games don’t always have
an actual lot up for bid. The revealed cards may interact with a pot of gold,
for example, but they don’t represent contingent offers to purchase some lot
as in most auctions. Second, even when a lot or lots do exist, like in Eggs &
Empire, winning the auction doesn’t necessarily lead to winning the lot. More
generically, the player with the highest bid doesn’t necessarily win the auction.
Typically, in these games, in addition to the currency value on the card, there

300

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

are some additional effects and interactions that can impact the auction’s
outcomes dramatically. Nevertheless, these games merit a mention here as
they are a means of using the Constrained Bid structure in an engaging and
more thematically resonant way.

Once-Around Auction

Description
The players each have one opportunity to bid, either passing or raising the prior
bidder. The order of bids is determined by one of the Turn Order structures.
After the last player has their opportunity to bid, the high bidder wins.

Discussion
The Once-Around Auction structure takes a straightforward approach to
shortening auctions by simply collapsing the whole auction into one round.
This works very well for speeding the auction, but it does have disparate
impacts on players depending on their position in the turn order. The first
player is faced with the substantial challenge of making a bid without any
other information. Their bid will set the market and is vulnerable to being
outbid by any player, who can bid as little as one dollar more. By contrast,
the last player in turn order has perfect information. They know exactly how
much to bid to win the lot. Often, the player in the next-to-last place is faced
with a lot that is relatively inexpensive, but which they don’t actually want.
However, they feel like they must police the auction and raise the bid to
prevent the last player from getting a windfall.
Whether the strong left-right binding (the term used to describe games
that are strongly impacted by turn order, and specifically, the players seated to
the right and left of a given player) of this mechanism is positive or negative
is largely a matter of perspective, but it is something to design around. For
example, turn order can itself be priced in such a manner that the advantage
provided by going last in the auction is accounted for. Alternatively, going

302

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

first in other aspects of the game may be quite powerful, to help balance the
disadvantage of going first in the auction.
Another approach is to use constrained bids that require bidders to raise
the current winning bid by a more substantial increment, or to provide the
first bidder with the right to match the final bid and take the lot.
Once-Around Auctions aren’t that common in modern designs, having
been superseded by Sealed-Bid Auction (AUC-04) that are agnostic to turn
order, or by drafting mechanisms that eliminate the role of currency entirely.
Generally, they should be used when tight coupling to turn order is desirable
and turn order is central to the design.

Dutch Auction

Description
A simultaneous single-bid system in which the lot starts at a very high price, and
then is gradually decreased by the auctioneer or other controlling mechanism,
until someone agrees to claim the item at its current price, ending the auction.
The first bidder to accept the current price is the winner, such that there are
no ties. A Dutch Auction is sometimes also called a one-bid auction because of
this feature that the first bid made is also the only bid in the auction.

Discussion
The Dutch Auction has a storied history, having been invented in the
seventeenth century in Holland to manage the sale and trade of tulip bulbs
that arrived in Holland via the Ottoman Empire. A Dutch Auction maximizes
the price at which a good is sold, and incentivizes buyers to act quickly, since
once a bid is made there is no opportunity to counter the bid; the auction
is over!
Dutch Auctions only work well when there is a single item up for bid, or
a single lot. All bidders must receive information of the offer price dropping
simultaneously and must be able to respond immediately. Any bidder with an
informational time lag is highly disadvantaged in this kind of auction, whether
that time lag is on hearing the newly announced price, or in submitting a bid.

304

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

One way to execute a Dutch Auction is with an actual clock that counts
down prices, as in Merchants of Amsterdam, but the componentry alone makes
this an unusual approach.

Dutch Auctions spread over multiple turns are very common in board
games and are often implemented as a row or river of cards. Each position in
the row is tied to a price and players may purchase a card from any position.
When a card is purchased, more expensive cards slide down and become
cheaper. In many games, the last card is free, and in others, the cheapest card
will disappear from the market every turn, and a new card will enter at the
pricey side. Examples of this market row include Suburbia, Phil Eklund’s
Pax series, and Through the Ages. A common variant can be seen in Small
World, in which players can purchase the first card in the row for free or pay
1 coin per card they want to bypass until they reach the card they wish to
purchase. The trick here is that a player acquires any coins on a card they
