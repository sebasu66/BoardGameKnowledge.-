of players playing. Each player picks a card from his or her hand to keep,
then passes the hand to the left, and receives a hand from the player to the
right. Play continues until all cards are selected. This kind of draft accelerates
gameplay because all players are choosing at the same time. However, unlike
a Rochester draft, where all choices are visible at all times, and where players
have nearly equal access to every card, in a parallel draft, each player will
only see some fraction of the cards—as few as half in a 7-player game of 7
Wonders—and will simply not ever have the option of taking those cards.
Another consideration is if one player is particularly slow, he or she can create
a bottleneck, which often leads to confusion about which player is up to
which round of Drafting.
As mentioned earlier, Drafting, in nearly all its formats, presents two
questions. The first is what does the player value most. Many players will
stop their analysis here and select the card they like best. But, more skilled
players will ask whether they need to take that card right away, or whether,

460

when turn order wheels back around to them, that card will still be there. This
technique, called “wheeling,” adds tension and skill to Drafting.
Wheeling is particularly important to booster drafts of Magic: The
Gathering and other Collectible Card Games (CCG). What’s unique about
these styles of draft is that the pool of cards in the draft is unknown to any
player, since they come out of sealed booster packs. Moreover, in many CCGs,
card synergies are tightly coupled, such that once you begin drafting towards
some strategy or deck type, other cards drop to little or even negative value.
The extremes in valuation for cards between players make wheeling much
more likely to succeed, since the card that one player values the most may
have little use to the other players. When that disparity is large enough, it
might make sense to take a card that’s useless to you, simply to deny it to other
players, a move called hate-drafting.
Wheeling and hate-drafting are not mechanisms, they are behaviors that
emerges from the Drafting mechanism, and the underlying card distributions
and overall game system. They are part of what makes the Drafting
mechanism so engaging, and designers should evaluate their prototypes with
these behaviors in mind.
A few other variants on the parallel Drafting structure include whether
cards are played immediately after Drafting, as in Best Treehouse Ever, or in
turn order during a play phase, like in Medieval Academy. Sometimes, not all
cards drafted are played, as in Fairy Tale where only three of the five cards
drafted each round are played, and the other two are discarded. Another
variant is to allow players to mix their hand with the hand of cards being
passed. In this kind of setup, players may take as many cards as they wish
from the new hand, as long as they pass the correct number of cards to the
next player. Having players play a card immediately after drafting can also
help keep the draft on schedule, and avoids bottlenecking and confusion by
forcing all players to play at roughly the same cadence.
Drafting games can sometimes be played at 2 players, like in Seasons, but
they tend to be a little flat. Tides of Madness is a drafting game limited to 2
players only, and among its innovations is that players can be forced to collect
cards with madness symbols on them, and can even lose the game if they
collect too many.
7 Wonders Duel is a 2-player drafting game with quite a few mechanical
twists to ratchet up tension. Players can only draft cards on the bottom-most
revealed level of a structure, but by taking a card, they can reveal face-down
cards higher in the structure that become available for drafting. Cards can be
used for multiple purposes, including selling off for money, which incentivizes

hate-drafting. In addition, there are three possible win conditions, including
two in-game sudden-death wins. One win condition is tied to a tug-of-war
contest that requires both players to take enough military cards to prevent
being overrun by the other player. Another instant-win condition is subject
to a set-collection contest in which players must draft wisely to at least
prevent their opponents from assembling the winning set. These during-game
concerns, and the possibility of forcing certain lines of play because of them,
add richness to the Drafting choices.
