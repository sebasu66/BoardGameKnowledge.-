Building Actions and Rewards

Description
Buildings can offer varying rewards to different players, based on ownership
and turn order, or they may be upgraded to increase their rewards to all
players.

Discussion
Buildings may offer a greater reward for the first player to claim the building
and lesser rewards for players following. This is quite similar to selection
bonuses in a role selection game, a flavor of Action Drafting (ACT-02). Other
versions of reward choice allow for the player to choose among one of two
or more rewards, as in Caylus, where players may sometimes take two of one
resource or one of another. Yedo offers an extreme version of this mechanism:
players place workers in districts, rather than specific buildings, and may
choose from a variety of possible resolutions, including collecting resources,
purchasing weapons, or completing a mission specific to that district.

Worker Placement

343

One way buildings can vary in rewards is through improvements of
different kinds. In Wisdom of Solomon (originally released as Kingdom of
Solomon), players can build roads between different spaces, creating resource
regions that yield the cumulative benefit of all the connected spaces when
activated by a worker. In Agricola, and other Uwe Rosenberg designs, some
spaces will accumulate an additional resource from turn to turn, growing
richer and richer until a player finally selects them. Various games offer cards
or special abilities that improve the conversion rate of some building or set
of buildings that have a cost or offer some exchange. Conversely, buildings
may become deactivated or workers may be hindered from doing their work,
as with the Provost in Caylus or the City Watch in Yedo. A radical approach
to varying buildings can be seen in Fabled Fruit, in which buildings can be
replaced entirely with others in mid-play.

Turn Order and Resolution Order

Description
Worker placement is ultimately a drafting mechanism, and the order by which
actions are selected and resolved is an opportunity for design variations.

Discussion
Allocation of resources is a foundational concern of nearly every game, and
allocation by draft means that Turn Order is crucial. While some worker
placement games simply rotate Turn Order clockwise, like Stone Age, most fold
Turn Order into the worker placement engine itself. The simplest approach
is a building that grants Turn Order priority, as in Lords of Waterdeep. While
this is a simple approach, it has a substantial drawback in that it’s a choice
with strong left-right binding. In other words, the impacts on the players
adjacent to the new starting player are large: the player to the left gains an

Worker Placement

345

unearned windfall because they get to go second, and the player to the right,
through no fault of their own, is pushed to the end of line. One design answer
is to allow for multiple players to play into the Turn Order building, with the
player playing earliest getting the most favorable placement. More discussions
of this topic are in Claim Turn Order Action (TRN-05).
As discussed in Acquiring and Losing Workers (WPL-03), Last Will has
players draft a combination of Turn Order, workers available, and assistant
actions in one. Earlier positions in Turn Order have fewer workers and
abilities, while later positions have more.
An especially unusual mechanism for Turn Order is the master builder
token-pull system in Pillars of the Earth. Each player’s master builders are
placed in a bag and pulled at random, one at a time. The player whose builder
is pulled may choose to pay the current price in gold to take the action, or
may pass and accept a much later position in Turn Order. The price of the
action is then decreased by one gold. If this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s
another variation on the Vickrey auction (AUC-08, Dutch Auction). See also
Random Turn Order (TRN-11).
The randomness of this mechanism drew widespread critique, but it did
have a spiritual successor. In Lords of Waterdeep, up to three players can visit
Waterdeep Harbor to play an Intrigue card. In addition, once all players
have exhausted their available workers, the workers assigned to Waterdeep
Harbor can be reassigned to any available actions space. The similarity to the
mechanism in Pillars of the Earth is that placing a worker in Waterdeep Harbor
offers the reward of playing an Intrigue card, at the cost of having to wait for
the remaining workers to be placed before getting another choice at an action
with that worker. This implied cost goes down with every succeeding turn,
just as the explicit cost of the master builder goes down with each player’s
turn. The random aspect of Pillars of the Earth was not reproduced, but the
core notion of variable price for placement priority was retained.
Returning to variations on Turn Order, Francis Drake has Turn Order for
the following phase set by the previous phase. The player who takes the fewest
actions in the first phase goes first in the next phase. Belfort allows players to
spend a worker to exchange Turn Order position with another player during
the placement phase. However, the game features a strong polarity in the
benefits of Turn Order. In the worker placement phase, going early is best,
but in the building phase, which features an area majority contest, going last
is most advantageous.
This phase difference brings up another point of design distinction, which
is when worker actions get placed versus when they get resolved. The simplest

346

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

placement rule is that each player places one worker on their turn (Agricola),
which encourages good pace in play. Increasing the complexity, players may
be allowed to claim a building, even if it requires more than one worker
(Francis Drake), or may be allowed to play either one worker, or assign all
their remaining workers to a group of public action (Belfort). Sometimes, each
player places all their workers on their turn (Alien Frontiers).
Placement is not synonymous with resolution, however. Caylus resolved
placements and distributed rewards only at the end of the placement phase,
when all workers are out. This delay in resolution creates space for the provost
mechanism, which may cause buildings too far down the road to fail to
activate, even though they are staffed by workers. It also allows players to
set up combos, where resources gained earlier along the road can be used by
workers further down the road, regardless of the order that those workers were
placed in. Similarly, the Tzolk’ in escalating rewards case requires resolution to
occur when workers are recalled, rather than placed. However, in Tzolk’ in, the
decision is to either place a worker, or return all workers from one building,
rather than recalling the whole class of workers from across the board. Belfort
workers don’t collect their goods until all players have completed placement,
because the player with the most workers gathering in each building will gain
a bonus resource.
When workers return home is another element of the worker placement
mechanism that designers have experimented with. In The Manhattan Project
players resolve their actions on worker placement, but must spend a turn
retrieving workers. This tends to create a strong blocking dynamic, since
players receive benefits up front, and their workers continue to block other
players until they are retrieved. Timing your retrievals relative to other players
is critical for effective play. In Istanbul workers can be retrieved for free by
moving back through the spaces they were left on, or by spending a valuable
action recalling all workers to the fountain in the center of the bazaar.
Through careful planning, players can plot efficient courses, recover workers
for free, and gain an action advantage over their opponents.

Movement

ӶӶ
Perhaps the most common dynamic in games is movement. In large part this
is because movement is inherent in what games model, whether it’s an armed
conflict, a journey, or a race. Movement is an incredibly effective and powerful
tool in the designer’s arsenal because of how dense movement can be in terms
of information. Moving a single piece changes its relationship to every other
piece on the board. And yet, signaling that change, communicating that it
has occurred, is as simple as picking up a piece and placing it down again.
The most ancient board games we know of, like the Egyptian games
Mehen and Senet, have pieces moving around a board. Chess, Checkers, Shogi,
Parcheesi, Backgammon, Monopoly, and Candyland, all feature movement
as a key mechanism. Some of these games feature movement in a single
direction, along a fixed path, while others offer greater choice, or even free
play within a two-dimensional space. In some games, the pieces on the board
are all identical, while in others the power to move is encoded in the pieces
themselves. Some games have specific spaces that are more valuable to occupy,
while in others the positional value of any space can change as the board
develops.
Movement is a way of creating dynamic and evolving situations, which can
force players to change their plans and react to their opponents. Done well,
movement rules are easily understood, yet lead to emergent gameplay. But
movement rules are hard to get right. Dealing with questions like blocking,
line of sight, terrain types, movement along a diagonal, and more, can turn
what seems like an elegant and simple concept into a tangle of conflicting
and confusing rules. Among the innovations of the European design school
was an increasing abstraction of movement rules, or even total abandonment
of movement.
349

350

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Despite the challenges, movement remains a durable feature of many board
games. Movement is fun, and it lends itself well to many different kinds of
games in a huge variety of implementations and specific mechanisms, while
being conceptually familiar and intuitive, no matter what the context.

Tessellation

Description
The playing field is divided into spaces to regulate movement.

Discussion
There are several ways to sub-divide boards, all of which are covered in this
section.
The most basic is a one-dimensional division. This is often called a track,
and it is commonly used in Race games, Roll and Move games, and others.
There are several variations on the standard track.
First, there may be alternate paths that branch off of the main path. These
can be a shortcut that reduces the distance needed to travel, or a path that
gives bonuses or other information, as in Careers, where each potential career
choice has its own path.

352

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Second, certain spaces, or collections of spaces, may be divided into subspaces the width of the track. This is typically used in racing games to create
lanes, allowing multiple players to occupy the same space, and to create
“inside” and “outside” lanes. The number of lane spaces can be reduced,
sometimes even down to one, to create bottlenecks that create challenges
for players. This is used to great effect in Ave Caesar and Downforce, where
vehicles move a set number of spaces based on cards. Forcing players
to waste a good card because they cannot get through a bottleneck is a
key strategy.
Boards can also be laid out in two dimensions, either with a regular pattern
or irregular shapes. The most common regular patterns are squares (as in
Chess) and hexagons, used in many wargames, such as PanzerBlitz. Triangles
may also be used, but are uncommon as they limit options for adjacency, and
tend to look busy.
If squares are used, the designer needs to decide if pieces may move
diagonally. From a distance standpoint, a diagonal move is approximately
50% further than an orthogonal move, which needs to be compensated for
in games striving for realism. Hexagonal Tessellations do not have this issue,
and all natural moves are the same distance. This is why they are commonly
used for wargames and others require realistic movement. Note that a square
grid with each row shifted 50%, making a brick pattern, is isomorphic to
a hex grid (and easier to prototype, particularly when creating tiles—even
rectangular cards can be used for this purpose).
Some games need to model three-dimensional space, typically those that
take place in space, in the air, or under the sea. A common approach is a
dashboard or log sheet for each vehicle that tracks the altitude. This system
is used in Richtofen’s War and Air Force. Some, like Attack Vector: Tactical,
have tokens placed next to or beneath pieces to indicate height above or below
the playing surface. Others, like Chopper Strike and Sub Search, physically
create multiple levels of play area by vertically stacking boards, separated by
supports. These are physically striking and easy for players to interpret, but
need to limit the number of levels due to cost, physical size of the board, and
ease of reaching in between levels to reach pieces.
Irregular patterns are called Area Maps. Diplomacy is an example.
There are several design considerations for Area Maps. First, if they
regulate movement, the areas should be approximately the same size, or
at least “movement equivalent.” For example, a mountainous region may
be divided into smaller, more numerous spaces so it takes more moves to
traverse.

Movement

353

If possible, regions should not touch at a corner, they should only touch
along an edge.
Area maps are isomorphic to point-to-point movement, where boxes
or circles are connected by lines. Sometimes point-to-point maps can be
preferable, as they clearly show connections, and connection information (like
rivers or borders) may be more evident. Point-to-point maps are also common
in space games, where the connection between stars is shown.
Some maps are a combination of two-dimensional point-to-point and onedimensional tracks. For example, Trains and Stations has tracks in between
cities that players must build along.
If a region contains important information, like terrain type or resources,
the graphics should be visible and distinct even if pieces are present.

Roll and Move

Description
A randomizer is used to determine how far to move a piece. The space landed
on determines the action(s) a player can take.

Discussion
Roll-and-Move games are emblematic of many of the earliest games people
are exposed to. This Roll-and-Move mechanism has also been used in some
of the oldest known games, including Senet and Backgammon.
Because Roll and Move has been used in so many simplistic children’s
games, it has the reputation as an anti-pattern. Players do not feel in control
of their actions, and are at the mercy of the randomizer, which could be dice
(Monopoly), a spinner (Chutes and Ladders) or cards (Candyland).
To mitigate this, the designer should extend the mechanism to allow for
more player choice. One way is to give the players more ways to apply the
results of the randomizer, as in Backgammon, where the player can use the
dice in a variety of ways. Other options are to have mechanisms that allow
the players to modify, use a subset of the number, or choose direction, as
in Talisman, wager on movement as in Long Shot and Camel Up, or wrap
it in a Push-Your-Luck mechanism like Nur Peanuts!. Other options are
discussed in the following sections: Different Dice (MOV-07) and Probability
Management (UNC-09).

Pattern Movement

Description
Pieces move in a specific pattern relative to the board grid.

Discussion
This Pattern Movement mechanism gives pieces specific ways that they can
move relative to a grid. There are three basic styles:
1. Fixed Target Spaces: This is similar to the way that knights move in
Chess. There are a few specified target squares, and the piece may be
moved to any of them. They may or may not be able to jump over spaces
that are blocked by friendly or enemy pieces. These moves do not need
to be reversible. While a Chess knight may return to the square it came
from, a pawn may not move backwards. In Shogi the Gold, for example,
may move diagonally forward, but not diagonally backward (although
it may move straight backward).

358

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

2. Any Distance in a Direction: The Queen in Chess would be an example of
this movement style. Pieces may move any number of spaces in a given
direction, until blocked by another piece. Sometimes, the directions are
fixed relative to the board, so pieces cannot return to where they came
from. The Lance in Shogi, for example, may move any distance forward,
but may never move backward until it is promoted.
3. Jumping: Jumping over pieces may be a requirement for moving or may
be used to capture. Sometimes jumps can be chained, as in Draughts
(Checkers) and Chinese Checkers, which can lead to dynamic and
dramatic play.
Games with Pattern Movement often have a Promotion mechanism, where
pieces that reach the end of the board (or close to the end, as in Shogi) are
converted into a more powerful version of the piece.
Navia Dratp has pieces that promote by spending a currency to upgrade
them. It is earned by moving and capturing, and different pieces cost different
amounts to upgrade, which gives a great tool for balancing.
A different take on Promotion is shown by The Duke, where pieces are tiles
with different movement patterns on either side. When a piece is moved, it is
flipped over to its other side.
Movement Patterns can be difficult to learn if there is a different pattern for
each piece, and it is not part of the piece, as in Chess or Shogi. However, some
modern games, such as the aforementioned Navia Dratp and The Duke, print
the movement pattern directly onto the piece, which makes it much smoother
for newer players to learn and allows for even more different styles of pieces.
Nevertheless, games like The Duke do present players with the challenge of
remembering the movement pattern on the reverse side of each piece. Player
references can help alleviate these issues.

Movement Points

Description
A piece is given a number of points to spend on movement.

Discussion
This Movement Points mechanism allows the designer to differentiate units
as well as movement conditions. It is commonly used in wargames, as in
Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, for example, where infantry units have
three movement points, and armor units have six. However, it is also used
in train games like Empire Builder and racing games like Formula De to
control movement. Normally, each space takes one Movement Point, but
certain obstacles and terrain, like mountains, or swamps, may take more. In
more tactical games, rivers and roads may slow or accelerate movement by
controlling how many Movement Points are used. Movement Points may be
further generalized as Action Points (ACT-01), where movement is just one
of the actions that points may be spent on, as in Tikal.
Another extension is to allow normal Movement Points to be increased
by incurring some limitation or penalty. For example, many wargames allow
for units to “double-time” or “redeploy” at the expense of not being able to
conduct an attack or come within a certain distance of an opposing unit.
Others allow units to take on a status of “exhausted” by moving farther than
normal, but having their other skills degraded until a “rest” turn is taken.

Resource to Move

Description
Players expend a Resource to Move.

Discussion
Games where players are moving a limited number of pieces (typically one)
may give them a resource that needs to be expended to move. This can take
the form of a card with a numeric value, as in Ave Caesar or Ben Hur, or it
can be a currency such as fuel or something more abstract. In Hare & Tortoise,
players need to spend carrots to move, and can acquire them through various
actions.
The resource may also have to be expended to change velocity. This is
most commonly seen in space games, like Attack Vector: Tactical, where fuel
modifies velocities. However, it can also apply to traditional racing games,
like Mississippi Queen, where players are racing steamships on the Mississippi
River. In Mississippi Queen, players may normally increase or decrease their
speed by one. If they wish to accelerate or decelerate at a higher rate, they
must expend coal, which is a limited resource.
Scotland Yard gives players a limited number of tickets of different types—
Subway or Bus for example—one of which must be used each turn depending
on the type of transportation taken. If the detectives exhaust their tickets
before catching Mr. X, they lose the game.

Giving players a resource that they need to manage is one way to mitigate
the common issues with random Roll-and-Move games (MOV-02), as it
increases player choice.

Measurement

Description
Pieces may be moved up to a certain distance, measured by a ruler.

Discussion
In this Measurement system there is no grid or other tessellation breaking
up the map. Pieces are free to move any amount up to their movement limit,
expressed in inches, centimeters, or using a game-supply ruler. This system is
typically seen in miniatures games, which are played directly on a table top.
Because of the analog nature of Measurement, these systems have several
unique issues they need to deal with. First, attack, like movement, is also
expressed in the Measurement units. The designer needs to decide whether to
allow for Measurement at any time to determine range, or only after attacks
or moves have been declared. Not allowing premeasurement gives an edge
to players that are better at estimating ranges but tends to make for a lighter
experience as sophisticated plans and strategies may fall apart because a
charge falls a fraction of a centimeter short. Most modern games allow for
premeasurement, although this does slow things down.
This is compounded by the second issue, that there is always some
imprecision in moving and Measurement. These systems require players to
communicate about intent of moves, and to act in a reasonable fashion.

364

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Finally, unlike Movement Points systems (MOV-04), measuring can be
challenging with different terrain types. Does movement in difficult terrain
count as moving “farther” than in other terrain? How are those Measurements
handled? These considerations make games more complex. These downsides
are offset by games that feel more cinematic and realistic due to the openended nature of the scenery, movement, and combat.

Different Dice

Description
Different Dice are used to move depending on unit or game state.

Discussion
As an alternative to giving fixed Movement Points to units (MOV-04), this
mechanism assigns a particular die or dice that are rolled to determine how
far a unit may move. This introduces some randomness in movement rates
but allows the player (and designer) to control the range.
In Formula De, each gear is represented by a different die. Players roll the
specific gear die to see how far they will move. These are special dice that
have a specific min and max value—the D20 5th gear die, for example, goes
from 21 to 30.
Battleball assigns a different die to each unit—D6s for the slow linesman,
and D20s for the speedy wide receivers. In this case, however, the dice are
standard, and go from 1 to 6 or 1 to 20 in these particular cases. This makes
the wide receivers much more variable.
In the dog-sled racing game Mush, dogs are represented by different dice
depending on the type of weather they prefer.

366

One of the advantages of this system is that there is very little rules
overhead. Once the die is selected, you roll it to generate that number of
Movement Points.

Drift

Description
Two movement cards are played to move. The sum represents the distance
forward moved; the difference represents the sideways movement (Drift).

Discussion
First introduced in the dog-sled racing game, Snow Tails, this Drift system is
both thematic and gives players options for clever play. Each of the two dogs
pulling the sled has a number card placed on it. The sled is moved forward by
the sum of the numbers, and it must change lanes equal to the difference, in
the direction of the dog that was assigned the higher number.
Since players may only play one card per turn (with the card on the other
dog remaining the same), careful management of resource, and how you Drift
through the course, is essential for winning play.
While this system has not been used outside of Snow Tails and its successor
Mush! Mush!: Snow Tails 2, we feel that it is worth including here because
it shows how different movement mechanisms can be thematic, clever, and
straightforward. It may well be that the close consonance between theme and
mechanism is precisely why this hasn’t been reused.

Impulse

Description
A turn is broken up into a series of small Impulses. Depending on their speed,
units will be able to move in specific Impulses.

Discussion
Originally pioneered in Star Fleet Battles, this system simulates simultaneous
movement of player pieces. Rather than one player moving their full distance,
and then the next, moves are interleaved. There is a chart that shows which
Impulses a ship will move in for different speeds. When a ship becomes active,
it moves a single hex.
As an example, in Star Fleet Battles, ships may have speeds from 0 to 16,
so there are 16 Impulses. A ship that is moving at speed 4 will move every
fourth Impulse. A ship that is moving at speed 6 will move in Impulses 3, 6,
8, 11, 14, and 16.

This system increases realism by having ships gradually approach each
other, rather than jump to a new location and fire from there. However, it
does so at an increase in complexity and bookkeeping that requires one of
the players to keep track of the progress of the turn, and alert players to when
particular ships need to move.

Programmed Movement

Description
Players simultaneously program their movement, and then reveal and execute it.

Discussion
This is a subset of Action Queues (ACT-06), so the considerations there apply.
However, there are some specifics relating to movement to cover here.
First is the Right-Left issue. Programmed Movement games often have
turning as one of the orders. Robo Rally is an example. This can often be
difficult for players to visualize and can result in turning the wrong way. It
can be beneficial to have the turn cards labeled as Clockwise and CounterClockwise, rather than Right or Left, as these may be simpler for players to
visualize, but the issue remains.
To avoid this, some Programmed Movement games either have a generic
Turn action, allowing the players to choose facing at that time, or allow free
rotations. The Dragon & Flagon is an example.
Another is how challenging the spatial puzzle will be, and how that fits into
the game theme. Robo Rally creates a complex space for players to navigate by

372

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

constraining them in two ways. First, players draw a hand of nine cards, and
must select five to be programmed. It is frequent that players do not have the
exact cards they need to get where they would like to go, so that forces them to
evaluate a variety of alternatives. In addition, there are features on the board
like conveyor belts, pits, and pushers that, although deterministic, make it
even more challenging to picture the result of a sequence of cards. There is also
bumping—if players move into the same space as another robot, they push
it out of the square, which can have a huge effect on where that robot ends
up. Then, if robots take damage, they may have cards “locked” into place,
making coming up with a plan even more challenging. All of these elements
foster a feeling of chaos, which is the goal of Robo Rally, which players tend
to either love or hate.
Space Cadets uses a similar system, with cards being drawn and placed in
sequence to plot movement. But it gives a little more control to players, as
there are fewer obstacles on the board, and ships pass through each other or
may occupy the same space. Players also have more control, as they can slow
down, reducing the number of cards played, or allocating more of the Energy
resource to Helm, allowing for more cards to be drawn.
Another lever for the designer is the number of cards to be placed in the
queue. This materially impacts the complexity of planning. While Robo Rally
has players plot five cards, duck! duck! Go only has them plot one, befitting
its intended younger audience. Volt: Robot Battle Arena has players place a
die on a chart indicating the direction they want to move, with the die face
indicating the distance. There is no facing—robots can move or shoot in
any direction chosen. This puts the emphasis in Volt: Robot Battle Arena on
guessing what the opponents will do, rather than on how to control your
own robot.

Relative Position

Description
The precise location of units is not tracked. Only their Relative Position is
important.

Discussion
The standard use case for this mechanism is in racing games that track relative
order but not specific position. For example, in Formula Motor Racing, the
cars for the players are simply in sequence from first place to last. Players
take actions to try to move further up towards the front of the line and be in
first place when the game ends. The distance between first and second place
is always the same. There is no further representation of distance or gaps
between cars.
Similarly, in Get Bit!, players are swimmers trying to escape from a shark,
and only their relative position is tracked. The shark attacks the player last
in line.

374

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

This system has the benefit of simplicity and focuses on specific aspects of
racing. It also eliminates the need for a board, track, or lanes, and the rules
and space overhead that go with that. It also keeps the games competitive, as
it is literally impossible for a car to get too far into the lead to catch or drop
too far behind the leader. Everything is constrained.
Roadkill is a hybrid version of this system, which has a series of location
cards that players race through. Not all players need to be on the same location
card, but those that are placed in a ranked line.
Another type of Relative system is used in Up Front. This card-based tactical
combat game has squads that move toward or away from other squads. Their
location is represented by an abstract concept called Relative Range, which
goes from 1 (far away) to 5 (right on top of each other). Abstracting movement
in this way allows Up Front to focus on other tactical elements of the battle.
Racing or movement does not need to be the central metaphor for use of
this mechanism. In Guillotine, players manipulate a line a people, with the
character at the head of the line needing to put their head on the chopping
block.

Mancala

Description
Movement is based on the number of units at the starting location.

Discussion
This system arises from a family of games from Africa, most notably Mancala.
In Mancala, the board is a series of pits organized essentially in a ring. Various
numbers of playing pieces are in each pit. On their turn, a player selects a pit
and removes all the pieces in that pit, and places one in each successive pit in
a single direction. If there are three pieces in a pit, for example, one each will
be placed in each of the next three pits going around the ring.
A common variation on this mechanism is that only one piece moves, but
the distance it gets to move is exactly equal to the number of pieces in the
space it starts in. In Finca, this system is used to move around a Rondel for
action selection (ACT-10), and all pieces, regardless of owner, count toward
the distance moved. Finca also has the twist that the strength of the action
is based on the number of tokens in the destination space. In Downfall of
Pompeii, players begin the game by placing their pawns into buildings in the
city. After the first eruption, players can add pawns to a building equal to
the number of pawns already in the building, and finally, after the second

376

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

eruption, players move pawns a number of spaces equal to the number of
pawns on the originating space.
In Theseus: The Dark Orbit, players move their pieces around a space station,
again based on the number of pieces located in the starting area. However,
they have the choice of going clockwise or counter-clockwise.
These systems have a lot of opportunity for clever play and are highly
interactive as pieces from all players are commingled and directly impact the
options available to each.

Chaining

Description
Pieces are stationary but are built out in chains.

Discussion
While the pieces in these games are stationary, building them in chains gives
a dynamic feel of movement. In fact, most of these games are typically about
taking journeys and traveling.
In Expedition and Lazer Ryderz, players place a chain of arrow tokens or
templates to show the path they are taking. They are considered to be at the
tip of the chain. In both cases, if the chains cross, something special happens,
which is the rationale for leaving the chain.
In Through the Desert and Quartermaster General, players do not have to
play from the tip of the chain. They may extend from anywhere. This is more
in keeping with the themes of establishing caravans or supply lines.
Using chains, rather than just a single unit, creates opportunities to
blockade other players, forcing them to cross your path, or topologically
isolate them. The static nature of the placements makes these games simple
to teach but can open up tactical options for deeper play.

Bias

Description
Pieces automatically move in a certain direction, or it is easier to move in a
certain direction.

Discussion
The Bias mechanism is typically used to simulate wind, currents, conveyor
belts, and other physical systems. There are typically two types: Automatic
and Influencers. Automatic Bias mechanisms move pieces in a set direction,
typically at the end of each turn. An example is the conveyor belts in Robo
Rally, which automatically move all robots on them, as well as possibly rotating
them. Others are the rivers in Niagara and The Adventurers: The Temple of
Chac, which slide all pieces on the river toward the falls, or the magnets or
fans in Darter. This is also commonly seen as gravity in space games, such as
Demon’s Run, which move players that go too close to black holes.
These effects are often indicated to the player by arrows on the board
showing the effect on pieces. If movable elements are causing the effect,
iconography on the piece is often used.
Influencer mechanisms make it easier to move in certain directions. This
is very common in sailing games, but it can also be seen in other themes, like
mountain climbing. In Yacht Race, the distance a ship can move is directly
related to the wind direction.

380

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

This mechanism can give texture to an otherwise featureless map, as in a
sailing or space game. When players have some control over the element in
question (moving magnets in Darter, or changing wind direction in Yacht
Race), it can present the players with really interesting tactical possibilities. For
example, in Niagara players can influence how fast the river flows each turn.
These mechanisms need to be used with some care, particularly with
automatic biases when positioning is critical. If the system gets complicated,
it can be difficult for players to picture where they will be at the end of their
turn, particularly if this is combined with Programmed Movement (MOV-10),
as in Robo Rally.
There are more complex variations on the mechanism. One is Gravwell:
Escape from the 9th Dimension, where the Bias point depends on player location.
Players move relative to the closest ship to them, whether ahead or behind.
A related mechanism is used in Tutankhamen. Players move along a track
and may only move in one direction. They may move as far as they want,
but only get to use the ability of a piece they land on. This one-way nature
of the board gives the players challenging decisions of whether to race ahead
for a desirable space further along the track, or to move slowly and get more
actions, but have to use only those spaces skipped by other players.

Moving Multiple Units

Description
Actions may Move one or Multiple Units.

Discussion
This is a subset of Command Cards (ACT-05). The considerations there apply.
This mechanism is used in its Command Card form by Thunder Alley,
where players control a number of cars, and the cards are used to move a
subset of them.
There are also games where players play cards that move Multiple pieces
that may or may not belong to them. The Wolfgang Kramer card system,
which includes Daytona 500 and Downforce, gives players a hand of cards,
each of which moves cars that may belong to them or to opponents. The key
to the game is playing cards at a time when the cars you want to move a
long way forward are relatively clear and can use the full movement, whereas
cars you are not interested in are blocked in and waste some or all of the
movement.
This type of system is frequently associated with Betting (UNC-01),
allowing player interests to overlap or conflict at different points.
Another example is Panamax. In this game, ships move through the
Panama Canal, and certain sections are too narrow for ships to pass each
other. So, if you wish to move your ship in that section, it pushes ships ahead
of them, giving them free movement.

Map Addition

Description
The map is added to as it is explored.

Discussion
This Map Addition mechanism is commonly used in exploration games, as
players expose new areas of the map. There are two broad types of games in
this category: Constrained, where the shape of the board is known, and players
must explore within those bounds, and Unconstrained, where players are free
to explore as they wish (sometimes with some rules). There are also games
where the map shape is defined by the scenario or mission but is hidden by
the game mechanics, as in The 7th Continent, or known to only one player, as
in Descent: Journeys in the Dark.
This mechanism is often implemented with tiles, and so is a subset of Tile
Laying. Much of that discussion applies here. But there are some specific
points for map building.
If players can build in any direction, it may keep them somewhat separated
as each explores their own area. If more interaction is desired, some incentive

384

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

to move to the center needs to be included. The cooperative real-time game
Escape: The Curse of the Temple implements this rather bluntly, by requiring
players to gather on a single tile periodically. In the stress and hurry of a realtime game, it can be challenging to avoid getting spread out.
If using tiles, edges can be used to gate movement. For example, in Eclipse,
tiles may be marked with a gate or be blank. If two gates match up on adjacent
tiles, players may move between them. Later, a technology may be developed
that permits movement even if only one gate is between two tiles. This allows
for structure and movement restrictions even in the openness of space.
The Map Addition mechanism can also be used to introduce uncertainty
into an essentially linear track. In Mississippi Queen and The Mushroom Eaters,
new portions of the track are revealed as they are moved onto. In Mississippi
Queen, this acts as a type of Catch-The-Leader mechanism (VIC-18), as the
leader may be out of position to take advantage of the newly revealed tile.
Exploration can also be procedurally generated. In Source of the Nile, when
exploring an empty hex, players roll on a series of tables to determine the
base terrain type, rivers, and other features. The system cleverly incorporates
adjacent spaces to make it more likely, for example, for a block of adjacent
jungle spaces to emerge rather than a series of isolated jungle spaces.

Map Reduction

Description
Over the course of the game, the map shrinks.

Discussion
Removing parts of the map can be psychologically interesting for the players,
as they feel more constricted both in space and options. We are exposed to this
Map Reduction mechanism first as children through the game Musical Chairs.

386

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Isolation and Hey, That’s My Fish! are classic representatives of this
mechanism. In both, players take a move and then remove a tile. In Isolation,
it may be any tile on the board. In contrast, in Hey That’s My Fish, it must be
the tile that the player began their turn on.
In Sinking of the Titanic, the board is shrunk in a fixed fashion, rather
than under player control, as the ship rotates beneath the water board and
the board gradually becomes reduced more and more.
In some games, the board closing is something that happens toward the
end of the game. In The Omega Virus sectors of the board may suddenly be
closed to the players completely as the game nears its timed conclusion.
Also worth mentioning are the Survive: Escape From Atlantis series of
games, where the board as a whole does not shrink, but safe tiles (land tiles
in this case) are slowly removed, forcing players into shark-infested waters.
Many other games don’t shrink the physical board; they simply reduce the
options available to the players. Ticket to Ride and many other rails games
naturally reduce the options available to players as more and more routes
get claimed. To a substantial extent, the question of whether the board
gets smaller or the options on it become fewer is mostly a matter of thematic
consonance and what is practical given the physical components involved.

Map Deformation

Description
The map is modified during the course of the game through rotation or shifts.

Discussion
In this Map Deformation mechanism, the map is traditionally composed of
a series of (typically square) tiles, composed of smaller spaces. Player tokens
are located on these tiles. When the tiles are rotated or relocated, the player
tokens are moved along with them.
Because this can often radically change the game situation, this mechanism
introduces a large dose of chaos into the proceedings. It can also make it
difficult for certain players who may have spatial relation issues to visualize
the result of the deformation. This is particularly true as tiles with more spaces
on them are used.
This mechanism can be implemented through means other than tiles. In
Stay Alive players move sliders around the edge of the board to control where
holes are located, possibly dropping marbles out of the game. In both Dune
and Yedo, an entire section of the board is blocked each turn by the sandstorm
and watchman, respectively.
Because of the impact of Map Deformation, it is typically the centerpiece
of the game, and not a secondary mechanism.

Move Through Deck

Description
Players Move Through a Deck of cards.

Discussion
This mechanism gives players the feeling of movement by forcing them to
work through a deck to get to the bottom, or some goal card. In Chainsaw
Warrior, for example, the deck thematically represents the house players are
exploring, with cards representing rooms or encounters, and players take
“move” actions to delve deeper.
This mechanism is also used in Incan Gold, where players flip cards to move
deeper into the temple.
Adopting this metaphor allows designers to give players a sense of forward
momentum while keeping the game compact, eliminating the need for a
board or large map. It also makes it easier to randomize. The Gating and
Unlocking mechanism (ACT-15) is good to use here to tier difficulty.

Movement Template

Description
A defined Movement Template is used to determine where a piece moves to.

Discussion
First pioneered in Wings of War, this system has been widely used since,
most notably in the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game. Each turn, players
simultaneously select which Movement Template will be used by each of their
units. For example, it may be a Short Straight, a Gradual Left, or a Sharp
Right. Moves are revealed, and the templates are used to determine where
each piece will end.
Because of the use of the templates, this mechanism is best thematically
integrated with pieces that need to keep moving, such as airplanes.
These games are similar to Programmed Movement (MOV-10), except
