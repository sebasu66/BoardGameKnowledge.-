Gamification is not limited to manipulating consumers, however. researchers have
begun to consider ways to use gameplay to encourage other useful behaviors, taking
advantage of people’s natural enjoyment of games. a recent example includes Foldit, a
crowdsourced search for useful protein molecules characterized as a series of puzzles.
another is experts exchange, an online database of solutions to computer problems.
Participants compete to provide the most useful answer to a given question, earning
points for being chosen. The points earn them badges of achievement and free access to
the site.
at the moment, few gamification efforts have created games with real strategy or complexity, but they could. You can use the mechanics we discuss in this book to analyze and
develop gamification strategies.

ChAptEr 12

Gamification is the latest trend in the serious application of games. By applying gamelike
mechanics to activities not normally thought of as games, gamification seeks to change
people’s behavior or to make dull, but important, tasks enjoyable. The idea is not really
new; airlines have been doing it for decades with their frequent-flier programs. By offering rewards to loyal customers, airline companies try to dissuade people from flying with
competitors. even a simple loyalty card that earns the buyer a free cup of coffee for every
ten cups purchased is a trivial form of gamification.

Communication Theory
N OT E We include
subconscious thought
because some senders
seek to send messages
to people without the
receivers being consciously aware of it.
The signals are sent
as subliminal stimuli.
This is known to work
in certain kinds of psychological tests, but
there is insufficient evidence that subliminal
messages can change
purchase decisions or
political opinions.

Games are related to other media like films, books, or newspapers; they all communicate to their audience. Films and video games use audiovisual means, while
books, newspapers, and board games rely on static images and written text.
Communication theory has long studied how effective different media and particular media messages are at reaching their audiences. Communication theory looks
at all types of messages and meaning: advertisements, political statements, and personal opinion, but also personal artistic vision and humorous statements.
Communication theorists have developed a model of communication in which a
sender sends a message along a channel to a receiver (Figure 12.3). The model typically includes the following elements:
The sender is a person or a party who wants to reach the receiver with a particular
message.

n

n

The receiver is the audience, the people who need to understand the message.

The channel is the way the sender sends the message to the receiver. The channel
is often referred to as the medium—text, images, and so on.

n

The signal consists of the tangible, physical signals used to address the receiver.
In a book, the signal is built from words and letters. In music, the signal consists
of vibrations in the air that we recognize as sounds of different frequency and
character.

n

The message is the intangible part of the message that resides in our brain. You
might think of it as (sub)conscious thought or the meaning. The aim of communication is to transfer the message from the sender to the receiver.

n

FIGURe 12.3
a model of
communication

Different attributes of these elements affect communication in different ways. For
example, if the signal is constructed in such a way that it rhymes, it attracts more
attention and becomes easier to remember. A famous example is the old campaign
slogan for Dwight D. Eisenhower’s campaign for U.S. president: “I like Ike.” The
characteristics of the channel or the medium are also very important. Music is good

meaninGFUL mechanics

277

at evoking moods and emotions but poor at transmitting rational assertions. Every
medium has particular strengths and weaknesses that must be taken into account
when you want to communicate effectively.

art and entertainment
communication theory still applies to your game, even if your game isn’t a serious game
and has no message to convey apart from its innate entertainment or aesthetic value
(that is, if you are making a pure art or entertainment game). The russian scholar of
literature and poetry roman Jakobson used communication theory to explain the difference between poetry and literature on the one hand and other forms of written text
on the other (1960). he observed that communication can focus on different things. For
example, a message that is focused on the receiver is an instruction or a direct address.
a classic example would be the U.s. army recruiting poster with a picture of Uncle sam
pointing directly at the viewer and text reading “i want YOU for U.s. army.” in contrast,
a message that is focused on the sender is trying to enhance the sender’s reputation.
Jakobson called these different focuses functions. he also identified the poetic function.
The poetic function is in use when the focus of the communication is on the signal itself—
when it calls attention to itself because it is artfully constructed, because it rhymes,
and so on. What we call literature and poetry are forms of communication with a strong
poetic function, and part of appreciating this type of text comes from our admiration for
the craftsmanship that went into constructing the signal.

It is important to note that this model of communication assumes that the signal
travels in one direction. It suggests that a sender has a specific message and that
the receiver does not reply. This model fits broadcast media, in which one powerful
sender (for example, a newspaper or a television network) sends one signal to many
receivers at once. Mass communication of this sort is effective because senders often
have the time and resources to produce long, high-quality signals that are good at
conveying the intended message. However, it turns the audience into passive consumers of signals. This approach does not suit all applications equally well. In an
educational situation, you want the receivers (students) to be active participants and
to play with the message themselves to fully grasp it. That is why we list exercises at
the end of every chapter in this book and provide interactive examples on the companion website.

How the Medium Affects the Message
To communicate effectively, it is important to choose the most suitable medium.
You have probably heard Marshall McLuhan’s famous quote “the medium is the

ChAptEr 12

his observations are equally applicable to any other medium and art form, including
games. We appreciate art games but also entertainment games, in part because we
enjoy and appreciate their skillfully constructed signals.

278

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

message” before. McLuhan meant that the attributes of the chosen medium for
communication are more important than the actual signal. He was exaggerating
for dramatic effect, but he had a point. The medium you choose reveals a lot about
your intended message even before you send it. People have beliefs and prejudices
about media that are quite independent of the actual message. For example, writing
a book makes us look more authoritative than making a film would.
The strength of games as communication media is that they allow interactive communication, both between the designer and the players and among the players themselves.
In a game, the audience is actively involved with the signal. This has advantages
but, as we will see, also makes communicating with games harder, or at least different, from communicating with books or films. Many of the people who commission
and pay for serious games—a serious game designer’s clients—still think in terms of
broadcast media. They’re used to thinking about presenting data rather than giving the audience something interesting to do. While games retain some elements
of classic broadcast media, they are also crucially different. Some messages are well
suited to be told through games, but others are best mediated through other forms.

sometimes it is better to make a Film
Films communicate certain types of messages more effectively than games can. if you
have a particular story that you want to tell and that story is long, is detailed, and leaves
little room for interpretation or experimentation, film will be much more effective.
Games are a medium that needs active participation by its audience. When a player plays
a game with a story in it, he contributes events to the story through his actions, even
if they don’t change the plot or the ending. if your message leaves no room for active
participation, then you shouldn’t make it into a game.

Games possess a unique quality that sets them apart from all other media: They
are the only medium in which the signal is generated by mechanics. Games can
use audio, video, animation, and text—the presentational media—to deliver their
message, but their mechanics are their strength. If your game uses only presentational methods, then you might as well use some other medium that is better suited
to your message. As we have shown, the mechanics that govern a game’s internal
economy create emergent gameplay. To build meaningful games, you will need
everything you have learned about mechanics so far and use that knowledge to
create the right mechanics to fit your message.
Games and films share the quality that their signals have a high production value.
This creates expectations in the audience. When we watch a film or play a game, we
expect a high-quality production. We might pay a few dollars to see or buy it, but
we know it costs far more to create it. This probably explains why clients expect so
much when they order a serious game: They compare it with the latest production
out of Hollywood and the latest batch of triple-A game titles. Serious games with
smaller budgets have trouble living up to these expectations because, unlike film, a

meaninGFUL mechanics

279

lot more work remains invisible to the casual observer—all the software engineering, tuning, and testing that filmmakers don’t have to do. Games are interactive
devices and must accommodate different scenes and different endings. Unlike films,
games are not just signals; they are machines designed to create the signal that must
deliver your message.

How Mechanics Send Messages
Good games, serious games included, don’t lecture or preach. To use a game to communicate, you don’t just produce a clever signal to convey your message. Instead,
you construct a machine—the game’s mechanics—that produces the signal for you.
Figure 12.4 illustrates the idea. This isn’t as efficient as simply telling people things,
but for some messages it is a better way of creating understanding and acceptance in
your receiver. People infer your message by interacting with the game and observing
its output.

communicating
via games

In the original SimCity, the player could set the property tax rate and decide what
to spend the revenue on. The game included a mechanic that caused businesses to
leave town if the player raised taxes too high. Some people interpreted this to mean
that the game had a pro-business, capitalist agenda. But it also included a mechanic
whereby the player could increase the citizens’ happiness by spending tax money
on civic amenities like sports stadiums and public parks—indeed, in the game, the
citizens demand them. Some people interpreted that to mean that the game had a
socialist agenda. Both the right and the left read political messages into the internal
economy of SimCity. In fact, the game was a well-balanced simulation of a mediumsized American town. Both messages were intentional but never stated in the form
of an explicit assertion. Instead, the players discovered them through gameplay. If
you tried to play the game either as a high-tax socialist or as a low-tax libertarian,
you would lose. The former would drive the businesses out of town, and the latter

ChAptEr 12

It may not seem obvious how game mechanics send messages, especially when, in
video games, the mechanics are mostly hidden and observable only through their
outputs on the screen and their reactions to a player’s inputs. We’ve provided two
examples to show how the process works: SimCity and PeaceMaker.

280

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

would drive the residents out by never having enough money to build the facilities they wanted. By making choices about how the game’s mechanics work—and in
particular, what the player must do to succeed—the game sends some rather subtle
messages. The true, overarching message of SimCity is that extremist policies don’t
succeed, but a balanced approach does.
While SimCity was designed to be pure entertainment, PeaceMaker is a persuasive
game, one kind of serious game. PeaceMaker sends a much more direct political message. The object of the game is to achieve peace between the Palestinians and the
Israelis, and you can play as either the president of the Palestinian Authority or the
prime minister of Israel. But in either role, if you take a hawkish, hardline attitude,
you are doomed to fail. The mechanics are set up in such a way that only constructive engagement can succeed.
This raises an important point: What makes mechanics-as-messages work is the
effort that the player expends to win the game. Games punish certain behavior
and reward other behavior, and to win, the player must learn, and then do, what
the game wants. If you created a sandbox game that offered an unlimited supply
of resources and no negative consequences for anything the player did, the player
could ignore any message that your mechanics were supposed to send. In fact, she
would probably never become aware of a message at all, because the game would
not constrain her behavior in a particular direction.
The fact that the player has to act to produce the signal is an important quality of
games. Although delivering your message through the mechanics is more subtle
than direct presentation, the player is more likely to remember the message because
she deduces it for herself over a longer period. Having her doing things, and thinking about their consequences, is much more effective than simply telling her what
is expected.

Design Challenges
Writing an essay or making a documentary to send your message requires talent,
but at least you know that you have complete control over the signal you create.
Sending messages via mechanics is trickier. You have some control over what will
be in the signal—the computer’s outputs—because you provide the sounds and the
images the game can display. But the player’s own actions will affect the way the
signal is produced. The player may do things that reveal those sounds and images
in a different order, or perhaps not at all. Nor can you be certain that your player
will necessarily infer your intended message correctly. He might not be perceptive
enough, or he might not care enough to think about it. Really hardcore players
often treat a game simply as an abstract system to be optimized and pay little attention to context or meaning.

meaninGFUL mechanics

281

As a designer of a signal-producing machine, you have to be aware of all the possible signals that the game might produce. Look closely at the player actions that
the mechanics require of the player (as we mentioned earlier, things the player must
do to win) and at other actions that are available but optional. If shooting things is
a core mechanic in a game and required to win, there is no point in denying that
the game sends the message “violence succeeds.” If you want to offer a nonviolent
strategy in the game, it should be a clear and viable option, one that can also lead
to victory. The economic structure of a game will dictate how the game might be
played, and the most effective strategies will send their message more clearly than
less effective ones. If a player can win a game rapidly and easily through violence
but only slowly and with difficulty through nonviolence, that sends a message that
violence is an efficient way to solve problems.
Even though mechanics are a more subtle way of sending your message than presentation, they can still seem preachy if you aren’t careful. If you frequently offer a
player a choice of options (say, violence or negotiation) but always punish one, the
player will quickly realize that it’s a false choice. Role-playing games that require
players to behave in conformity with their chosen good or evil character alignment
often make this mistake, producing what’s known as the “Jesus/Hitler dichotomy.”
Players who choose to be good must be absolute saints, while those who choose
to be evil must be homicidal maniacs. Their mechanics for determining whether a
player is acting according to his alignment lack any subtlety.

Even abstract mechanics that lack any context or back story can still create a certain
emotional tone. A game produces a different message —and evokes different emotions—when resources accumulate faster and faster because of positive constructive
feedback than when no resources are produced and the players need to survive and
make do with what little they can hang on to. The theory and design methods we
discussed in the previous chapters will help you to understand what messages your
game sends.

ChAptEr 12

PeaceMaker, the game about Israel/Palestine diplomacy, avoids this problem by
requiring that the player conciliate the hawks on his own side. You have to make
peace, but it isn’t enough simply to be a dove all the time; that will get you thrown
out of office by your own people. No matter which side you play, you must deal
with your own side’s religious militants as well as the other side. In effect, to win
the game you have to reconcile two mechanics with different criteria for success:
the need to stay in office and the need to make peace. It requires a nice political
balancing act to pull it off. In the early stages of the game, your own side’s militants
are powerful. Later, as your policies begin to succeed, they don’t matter as much.

Games and ethics
The joint responsibility of players and designers for the signals a game produces creates
a morally gray zone. To what extent can a designer be held accountable to the signals a
game produces, and at what point does the player become responsible for what a game
means? if you make a game designed to take a stance against bullying at school, are you
responsible if a player subverts the mechanics in such a way that can actually use it as a
bully simulator?
in 2001 there was a considerable debate about Grand Theft Auto III when critics asserted
that the game required the player to murder prostitutes to advance. however, the game
never requires that of the player. Players would find their health boosted to 125% after
visiting a prostitute and could get back the $50 that they paid her if they killed her afterward. But the player did not need to kill her, and the $50 would make little difference
on the vast amounts of money the player would typically have in that game. On the other
hand, the game did provide all the basic building blocks to construct those signals: it
provided prostitutes and weapons. The fact that the game allows the player to perform
these actions, with no negative consequences, created an unplanned message. it seems
worse than having these events occur in a film where the audience cannot be responsible
for the events that occur in the film.
We will return to the case of Grand Theft Auto III later in the chapter.

The Semiotics of Games and Simulations
The field of semiotics offers another relevant theoretical perspective on meaning in
games. Semiotics examines the relationship between signals and their meaning (or
the message)—in other words, between what the receiver perceives (sounds, images,
words) and what the receiver understands them to mean. It is often called the theory
of the sign. In classical semiotics, a sign is a double entity that has a material signal that stands for an immaterial meaning (or message). Based on the relationship
between its signal and its meaning, signs are classified into three types:
An icon is a sign where its signal resembles its meaning. A good example is a picture of a person: The picture simply looks like the person. Certain words are also
icons: They sound like the thing they indicate (such as the barking of a dog), but
these are rare.

n

An index is a sign where the signal is causally related to its meaning. The classic
example is a footprint that signals that somebody has been there (meaning). Similarly,
smoke (signal) can indicate the presence of a fire (meaning).

n

meaninGFUL mechanics

283

A symbol is a sign where the signal is related only to its meaning by convention.
Individual names are a good example, as are many words. Names do not resemble
the people they indicate, and most words we use share nothing with the objects
they indicate; we need to learn them all. Another example are roses (signal) that can
stand for love (meaning). The roses have no inherent relationship with love, and
our association between them is learned from convention. Cultures in places where
no roses grow use other symbols to stand for love.

n

classic semiotic terminoloGy
The terminology we use in this book is slightly different from the classic terminology
used in semiotics. Where we say a sign is a double entity consisting of a signal and
its meaning, a semiotician would say a sign is a double entity consisting of a signifier
that stands for a signified. These are terms coined by Ferdinand de saussure (1915). The
relationship between signal and meaning, or signifier and signified, is indicated as a
form of representation: The signal represents its meaning. Thus, a book can represent
an philosophical argument, and a game can represent certain ideas on the qualities of
a particular product. From now on, we will often use the term representation to indicate
this relationship between a signal and its meaning.

According to semiotic theory, symbols play an important role in our knowledge of
the world. Symbolic signs such as words allow us to speak about things in the world
in general terms and transfer observations from individual cases to more general
situations. The word apples is just a sound we make with our mouths, or a series of
squiggles on a page, but it can refer to a particular collection of real apples or to the
general concept of apples, including ones of different varieties. It also has a whole
range of other connotations and usages. The Dutch word for potato is aardappel
(“earth apple”) because when potatoes first arrived from the New World the Dutch
had no name for them and chose to modify a familiar one. The sentence “you’re
comparing apples and oranges” isn’t even about apples at all; it means “you’re making
an invalid comparison.” Finally, the fruit that Eve ate in the Bible is often described
as an apple (though that’s not actually in the Bible), so the apple has come to stand
for eroticism in art (though that’s not in the Bible either). In sum, words provide
shortcuts with which we can communicate large and complex meanings efficiently.

ChAptEr 12

The categories of icon, index, and symbol were devised by charles sanders Peirce, most
of whose important work was published after his death in 1914 (Peirce 1932). Peirce didn’t
use the terms signifier and signified, but his work was later adapted to fit the foundations laid by saussure. if you are interested in finding out more about semiotics, we don’t
advise you to go back to original works of Peirce and saussure, because they are not very
accessible to a modern audience, and a good deal of research has taken place since their
day. We recommend that you look at John Fiske’s Introduction to Communication Studies
(2010), which offers a useful modern approach both to semiotics and to communication
theory generally.

284

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

Semiotics were developed to study signs in traditional and mostly static media: spoken
language, texts in books, film, visual art, and so on. Applying semiotics to games, we
need to consider what we classify as signs. We could use semiotics to look at the signals produced by the game machine in the same way as semiotics would look at the
signs and signals in any other media. In that case, we can talk about the realism of
the signal, or its resemblance to its intended meaning. We can also try to apply semiotic
theory to the game itself and not so much to its output. In that way, you could say
that a game (as a tangible system of rules) stands for another system. For example,
the game World of Warcraft (the game with all its mechanics) stands for an imaginary
fantasy world (with all its intended complexities and nuances). In general, this is
exactly how many people think about simulation, in which you create one system
(the simulation) to model another system (the weather system, for example).

Games and Simulations

N OT E Sine qua non
is a Latin expression
meaning (approximately) “indispensable
ingredient.”

Game developers have debated the kinship between games and simulations for
some time. They are similar because they both use a system of rules (or mechanics)
to represent another system (or rather an idea of another system). Yet they are also
different. Game designer, Chris Crawford, observed the following in his 1984 book
The Art of Computer Game Design:
Accuracy is the sine qua non of simulations; clarity the sine qua non of games. A simulation bears the same relationship to a game that a technical drawing bears to a painting.
A game is not merely a small simulation lacking the degree of detail that a simulation
possesses; a game deliberately suppresses detail to accentuate the broader message that the
designer wishes to present. Where a simulation is detailed a game is stylized (Crawford
1984, p. 9).
More recently, game scholar Jesper Juul observed the following:
Games are often stylized simulations; developed not just for fidelity to their source domain,
but for aesthetic purposes. These are adaptations of elements of the real world. The simulation is oriented toward the perceived interesting aspects of soccer, tennis or being a criminal
in a contemporary city (Juul 2005, p. 172).
Although Crawford distinguished between simulations and games, he was really
talking about simulations for science and engineering versus simulations for games.
Games simulate things too—they’re just different things for different reasons. In the
next two sections, we’ll contrast the way the simulations in scientific and engineering research work with the way simulations in entertainment games work.

simULaTiOns in science
In the ordinary practice of science, the scientist begins by making observations of
the real world. She then forms a hypothesis about how nature operates to explain
her observations. To test her hypothesis, she performs experiments on the real world
and makes further observations. The results of those experiments either support her
hypothesis or disprove it; if they disprove it, she revises the hypothesis and tries again.

meaninGFUL mechanics

285

However, some hypotheses are expensive or impossible to test in reality, including those about very large or very slow systems (such as the behavior of galaxies) or
events in the past (such as geological processes). In these cases, the scientist forms
a hypothesis from observations as before, but instead of running experiments, she
builds a simulation that models her hypothesis about how nature operates. She then
runs the simulation and compares its results with more data from the real world. If
the simulation produces results that differ from the real world, she revises both her
hypothesis and the simulation.
Once a hypothesis seems to be solid—it has been supported by many experiments
or observations and never disproven—it becomes a theory and can be used to predict
future events and plan construction or other activities. Scientists can use simulations
to predict such things as the time and place of the next solar eclipse, for example,
and engineers can use them to design buildings and aircraft.
Scientific simulations focus on accuracy: They model the important aspects of a
system as closely as they can within the limits of the available time and computing
hardware. It is very important that the simulation’s model resembles the real mechanisms of the system the simulation represents, and in order to refine the model,
scientists and engineers check it against available real-world data. In semiotic terms,
we might say that the simulations are iconic: The signal (the simulation rules) resembles its meaning (the real mechanisms).

In ordinary games the designer’s object is not accuracy but enjoyment. The designer
starts with a game idea and refines it into a game design. Although it may change
over time, the design is a static rather than an interactive thing, a collection of
documents and diagrams and notes taken at design meetings. Programmers then
write software that implements the systems specified by the design. In many genres,
the software simulates something: a vehicle, a battle, a city. Both the designer and
the programmers may borrow ideas from observations of reality (such as the law of
gravity or the performance characteristics of aircraft), but they often ignore or alter
real-world systems for entertainment purposes. This produces the peculiar conventions found in video games, such as cartoon physics: Characters can fall much
longer distances without hurting themselves.
Instead of testing a game’s simulation by comparing with reality, game developers
play test it for enjoyment. When we refine our simulation, we refine it to improve
the entertainment value it delivers, not the accuracy with which it reflects the real
world. We care about accuracy only if the players care about accuracy. With vehicle
simulations or sports games, the players frequently do care about some aspects of
accuracy; but in other genres, they care much less. It’s important to know just which
aspects matter to your audience.
In semiotic terms, games use indexical and symbolic signs much more frequently
than they do iconic ones. Instead of trying to actually show a fighter’s state of
health through the appearance of the fighter, which would require a very large

ChAptEr 12

simULaTiOns in Games

286

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

amount of animation, we show a power bar. It’s both more efficient (requiring fewer
visual assets) and more effective (the player can read it instantly). Besides, the simulation of the fighter’s health isn’t accurate anyway, because in the game the fighter
fights at full strength until the last moment. The game, a stylized simulation of
fighting, focuses on the most interesting aspects of the system it represents and shows
these aspects with much more clarity.
Considering this difference between games and simulations, it is curious that game
developers spend so much effort on making games more realistic. Realistic games are
like iconic simulations: They try to create mechanics that resemble the mechanisms of
the real thing they represent as closely as possible. Although realism and iconic simulation in games is not a bad thing, it’s generally a mistake to concentrate on realism
in games at the expense of enjoyable gameplay or to assume additional realism will
lead to more fun. Games for entertainment should concentrate on communicating
their ideas through other, noniconic forms of simulation instead. Later in this chapter, we will explore the notions of analogous and symbolic simulation in more detail.

aBsTracTiOn
In either a scientific or a game simulation, we have to build mechanisms that are
simpler than the mechanisms in real life. This is necessary because otherwise we
would build a replica of the original system, which would run at the same speed and
operate on the same scale. We wouldn’t be able to use a replica to fast-forward time
or test ideas in a safe environment. Because a simulation must be simpler than the
system it represents, the simulation designer makes the decision to leave out certain
details. This process is called abstraction.
There are two kinds of abstraction: elimination and simplification. In general, you
can safely eliminate factors from your simulation that have little or no effect on the
operation of the mechanics. In simulating the aerodynamics of an automobile, it
simply may not be worth going to the trouble of including the windshield wipers or
the radio antenna; their influence is too small to bother with. And of course some
details, such as the interior décor, are completely irrelevant.
When we abstract through simplification, we look for features of a simulation that
contribute to its overall mechanics but whose inner workings don’t really matter.
Then we model those features in a very simple way, without including those inner
details. An example will show what we mean. Suppose you are trying to model the
effects of military vehicle failure on military readiness on a grand scale—all the
vehicles in an entire nation’s armed forces. Suppose that you also know from collected
statistics that one in every 10,000 aircraft landings puts the airplane out of commission because of damage to the landing gear. Your job is not to actually figure out what’s
wrong with the landing gear but simply to include this factor in your model of overall military readiness. Instead of modeling the landing gear machinery in detail, you
just build in a random 1-in-10,000 loss factor for landing gear damage. You have
abstracted the landing gear problem to a simple random factor. When you run the

meaninGFUL mechanics

287

simulation, you can change the rate of loss to study the effects of improving the gear
on the overall system, even if you don’t know how to actually improve the gear itself.
When a game includes a feature in which the avatar carries cash around, it seldom
keeps track of the exact numbers and denominations of the notes and coins. It simply says the avatar has $25.37 and leaves it at that. The inner details about the cash
have been simplified out because the player doesn’t care and it doesn’t affect the
rest of the mechanics. Both scientific and game simulations do this kind of thing all
the time—games more frequently. Scientists and engineers also tend to abstract different features than game developers do, and for different reasons. A scientist wants
an accurate outcome, while a game developer wants an enjoyable one.

simulations can lie
The writer and semiotician Umberto eco once famously wrote that semiotics is “the
theory of the lie” (1976). What he meant is that signs are anything that potentially can be
used to lie, and therefore by extension semiotics concerns itself with lies as well as truth.

an interesting example is the game America’s Army. This multiplayer first-person shooter
game goes to great lengths to appear as realistic as possible. it even requires you to go
through weapons training before you are allowed to go on “real” missions. The game
was published by the U.s. army, and obviously they have a stake in the game seeming
realistic. after all, they use the game to recruit people into the army. however, you can
learn a great deal about this game by comparing the game’s visual appearance with reality. For example, in the game you don’t see much blood or gore. real combat is a messy
and shocking affair that nobody would stomach easily. But that’s not the message the
U.s. army wants to convey when trying to recruit people.
more interesting is the choice to create a multiplayer game in which teams of players can
fight against each other but at the same time to represent both sides as american soldiers. as a player, you see yourself and your teammates as american soldiers, while you
see the other team as insurgents. at the same time, the other team sees themselves as
american soldiers and see you as the insurgents. Understandably, the U.s. army did not
want to publish a game that people could potentially use to train in fighting american
soldiers. as a result, the gameplay is essentially symmetric: Both sides have american
equipment and use american tactics. This is in stark contrast with the asymmetric
warfare that the game claims to depict (americans fighting insurgents). For this reason,
America’s Army cannot train prospective soldiers in counterinsurgent tactics.

simulations, too, can be used to lie to people, either innocently or intentionally. Game
scholar ian Bogost warns us that no matter how realistic a simulation might seem, it is
always to some extent subjective (2006, p. 98–99). The process of abstraction creates the
subjectivity, because the designer has made a decision about what to exclude. so, no
matter how accurate a simulation seems, you should never mistake it for the real thing,
and always be aware of the choices the creators of the simulation made—and why they
made them.

simULaTiOn in seriOUs Games
The simulations in serious games fall somewhere between scientific and entertainment simulation, depending on the purpose of the game. A game that intends to
persuade will skew its mechanics to make its point, as PeaceMaker did. An educational game will make an effort to represent its subject matter correctly, as a
professional flight simulator does.

N OT E if you are hired
to develop a serious
game, you will probably
work with someone
called a subject-matter
expert. This will be a
person who knows the
subject very well but
probably doesn’t know
much about game
design. You will have
to work with him or
her to combine your
expertise to create an
accurate, informative,
and engaging game.
This can require much
more compromise
and diplomacy than
entertainment game
design does.

In entertainment games, we often abstract out details that aren’t fun. This is why
entertainment war games never deal with the logistics of transporting food and
fuel to the battlefront or transporting the wounded to hospitals, because they’re
not as much fun as the strategy and tactics of combat. But a serious game that
genuinely intends to educate people about the logistical challenges of warfare cannot
afford to completely ignore these aspects and needs to instead find a way to include
them. This can create a conflict between keeping the game fun and sending the correct message.
To resolve this problem, design your serious game directly around the subject that
you want to teach, and abstract out other areas even if they would be more fun in
an entertainment product. To design a serious game about logistics, research the
economics, challenges, and actions associated with logistics, and build mechanics
to simulate them. Eliminate or simplify the combat so that, while it may affect the
game, the player does not participate in it. Concentrate on making logistical challenges enjoyable in their own right, choosing game mechanics that complement
this focus, and make the subject accessible to the player without distracting him
with other issues.
Also, just because your mechanics must simulate your subject matter accurately in
a serious game, it does not mean that they must simulate everything else accurately
too. Serious does not mean serious about everything. It’s perfectly acceptable to make a
game about logistics with cartoon physics (and cartoon graphics, for that matter) as
long as your simulation still teaches the core principles correctly.
It is almost always a mistake to start designing a serious game by trying to copy an
existing entertainment game. Build your mechanics and gameplay around your subject matter.

Analogous Simulation
An inventory is an example of an analogous simulation. Ever since Adventure (1976),
video games have included an inventory. The game allows the player’s character
to pick up objects and carry them around. The player manages these objects in the
game’s inventory screen. For design purposes or physical memory reasons, most
games use some means to restrict the number of things that the character can carry.
The game may limit the player to a fixed number of items, or it may assign a weight
value to each item and restrict the player to a certain total load.

The inventory system introduced by Diablo is a good example of what might be
called an analogous simulation. The mechanics of that inventory system do not
resemble the mechanics behind the represented system directly, but the underlying
ideas are causally related. In semiotic terms, the inventory is an indexical sign.
Instead of trying to simulate all the details of an item, such as size, shape, and
weight, Diablo’s inventory system uses an item’s relative size as its main restricting factor (Figure 12.5). Each item takes up a number of inventory slots, and the
available slots are limited and organized in a grid. An item may take up 1x1, 2x2, or
1x4 slots, and so on. The player character can pick up an item only when there is
enough space for it in his inventory.

FIGURe 12.5

This type of inventory is an example of analogous simulation on games because
the main factors that limit what someone can carry in real life (shape, size, and
weight) are represented by easily understandable two-dimensional shapes. There is
a proportional relation between number of slots of the virtual items and the weight,
shape, and size of their simulated counterparts. The internal rules and constraints
of the inventory mechanics are immediately apparent and intuitive (not in the least
because they are tailored toward visual representation on a screen). Yet, the management problems the system gives rise to are very much like those problems in real
life. The system even allows players to make an inefficient mess of their inventory,
teaching them something about the need to organize their property to fit more items
in their inventory—although some find this a tedious chore in a fantasy game.
The Diablo inventory system takes a lot of complicated real-world factors and
replaces them all by a single mechanism that is well suited to the medium of the
video game. Obviously some accuracy of simulation is lost (in Diablo an item cannot be large and light at the same time), but the overall behavior is retained (the
players are limited in what they can carry). The cleverness of the Diablo inventory is
that it collapses all the nuances of managing an inventory into a size puzzle, which
is easily represented by a computer screen, instead of weight, which was the more
common choice in earlier games but which translates to the visual medium of the
computer less well.

Another example of analogous simulation is the way most games handle health.
The health of characters and units is often represented by a simple metric: a single
percentage or a discrete number of hit points. Obviously, in real life, the physical
health of a person or the structural integrity of a vehicle is a complex matter to
which many different aspects contribute. By using a generic health value for a character, most games bundle all these aspects into one convenient mechanism. Both
players and computers can easily work and understand the numerical metric to
represent the bundle.

Symbolic Simulation
Analogous simulations are based on a relationship between their source system
and their simulation mechanics, as in our example of the Diablo inventory mechanism described earlier. They make use of a similarity between the two systems: not
a sensory, iconic similarity but a causal, indexical one. (In other words, the shape
of a real sword bears a causal relationship to the shape of the sword in the game.)
Symbolic simulation goes one step further. The relationship between the original
system and the simulation’s mechanics is not causal but arbitrary and based on
convention. The use of dice in many board games tends to be symbolic. For example, the roll of a few dice can stand for the outcome of a complete battle in a game
of Risk. In this case, the relation between rolling dice and fighting is arbitrary, and
one simple action well-known from other games is used to simulate a multitude of
actions for which most players would lack expertise. Dice can replace these battles
because, for the purposes of the game, the player should have little influence over
the outcome of these battles. Risk is about global strategy, not about tactical maneuvers on the field of battle. A player cannot control the result of dice just as a supreme
army commander cannot conduct every battle personally. (He does have the power
to decide how many troops he will commit to the battle and when to withdraw.)
Something similar occurs in Kriegsspiel and many later war games. In contrast to
Risk, these other games are all about tactical maneuvering on a battlefield. As a
result, their rules are quite elaborate, but the rules covering individual combat are
left to dice and attrition tables. Again, these games were designed to train tactical
skills, not how to use a gun.
Dice are wonderful devices to create a nondeterministic effect without the need for
detailed rules. At a suitably high level of abstraction, a complex and nondeterministic system, such as individual combat, has a similar effect as rolling a few dice: a
complex system whose outcome is hard to predict and control. This is exactly the
same sort of abstraction that we described earlier in the section “Abstraction” when
we discussed aircraft landing gear. Especially when the player is not supposed to
have much influence over this system, dice mechanics can be used to replace the
more complex system. The characteristic randomness of different dice mechanics
can be used to match many superficial, nondeterministic patterns created by more
complex systems.

Other examples, such as jumping on top of enemies to dispose them in the classic
video game Super Mario Bros., fall somewhere in between symbolic and analogous
forms of simulation. Although the precise implementation differs from enemy to
enemy, and certainly does not work against all enemies, it is a frequent feature
throughout the game and the series to which it belongs. This method of fighting
is a little odd, to say the least, but is simple to implement in code. The ability to
inflict damage by jumping on top of an opponent has become a convention within
platform games that is instantly recognizable to gamers and ties in with that genre’s
defining action of jumping from platform to platform.

There is, however, some relationship between the skills needed to defeat enemies
in Super Mario Bros. and in real life. In the game, it requires timing and accuracy,
which are among the skills involved in real fighting. Our point is that the simple
representation in the game allows us to do more than to hone and train those skills.
The metaphor of jumping on top of enemies is easy to grasp by the player, but the
game then goes on by inviting the player to experiment and develop strategies. The
jumping-on-enemies mechanism is a very clever way of adding combat rules to a
jumping game; it introduces no new actions for the player. It does this by replacing
actions it tries to represent (fighting) by other, arbitrary rules already implemented
in the game (jumping). This reduces the number of actions the player needs to
learn, allowing him to quickly move on to a deeper, more tactical or strategic interaction with the game instead of fussing around with its interface. As we argue
shortly, symbolic simulation effectively reduces the system to a simpler construction
with more or less equivalent dynamic behavior.

less Is More
Analogous and symbolic simulations tend to create simpler game systems than realistic iconic simulation would, with beneficial effects. Simpler games are easier to
learn, yet they still can be quite difficult to master. Games are not the only medium
for which the expression less is more rings true. In almost any form of representational
art, people appreciate conciseness and economy—especially critics and connoisseurs.
One exactly correct word is preferable to 20 others that miss the mark.

The connection between jumping on top of something and defeating something
in real life is not completely arbitrary, but its use in platform games has become so
conventional it parallels the definition of a symbolic sign in language. In the real
world, there are creatures that can be squashed by jumping on top of them, but it’s
a peculiar thing to do to a robot or a turtle. What is more, this method of fighting in
Super Mario Bros. is motivated more by the fun of the genre’s most prominent action
of jumping than it is motivated by any claim to realism. The link between the simulation and what is simulated is both arbitrary and conventional—especially in the
multitude of platform games that followed the example set by Super Mario Bros. (In
Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic had only one type of attack in the whole game: jumping.)

is there a maximum number oF mechanisms?
it is impossible to state exactly how many mechanisms a game should have. each individual design has its own balance, and of course the answer depends a lot on the game’s
intended audience. children’s games should be less complex than those for adults, but
even adults can enjoy very simple games. We feel that a game’s mechanics should provide as many gameplay options as its audience will enjoy (and as are consistent with the
game’s fantasy), but not so many that they impose an unreasonable cognitive burden on
the player. That is the balance to be struck.
different audiences have different preferences, however, and if you adopt the player-centric approach that ernest adams advocates, you must keep your player’s wishes in mind
at all times. in recent years, a number of fighting games have simplified their mechanics
with Quick Time Events (prompted sequences of button presses in which the player is told
explicitly what to do), much to the disgust of the fans of more traditional fighting games.
antoine de saint-exupéry’s famous quote “it seems that perfection is reached not when
there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away” (1939) applies
well to game mechanics—so long as the players are happy!

We already know that relatively simple mechanisms can produce emergence, and
games can create interesting gameplay with a small set of mechanics. Using a small
number of design patterns to generate complex gameplay has many advantages.
