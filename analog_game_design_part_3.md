first, and the game designer could gain attention with little upfront cost.
Print on Demand Emerges
Around the turn of the century a new technology emerged known as Print on Demand
(POD). With this technology things like books and game mats could be printed one at a time,
when the customer ordered them. At the very least it allowed you to do very short runs
(10 at a time). It was no longer necessary to print thousands of copies of a game and hope
that they would sell. This blew the market wide open for indie game developers, especially
those developing RPGs. Companies like RPGNow.com specialize in POD books for gamers.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t until the mid 2000’s that board and card game designers could start
making use of this technology via companies like Guild of Blades (www.guildofblades.com).
It turns out it’s a lot harder to make a deck of cards one at a time than a book.
Like Print and Play, this new publishing mechanism once again opened the way for
designers. You could now get nearly the same quality of components that you’d get out of a
traditional print run, but you didn’t have to buy 5,000 copies of a game that would only ever
sell 500 copies. POD would open the market for niche games.

51

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

As a designer, designing for POD is virtually the same as designing for traditional offset
printing, although your color options are now black and white or full color. You can’t do a
single non-black color, and it is the same cost to print two colors as it is four. The ultimate
quality you get isn’t quite as good as a large run printing, but it’s certainly good enough. The
main challenge you face as a POD publisher is that your cost per game is increased by about
double what a traditional run will cost per game.
Just like with an offset printing company, you must design your game to fit a printing
and die template, whether that be for game boards, books, or cards. So you design your
artwork, put it into a specific layout to exacting specifications, then ship it out to the POD
printer.
POD printers typically print on smaller paper stock than an offset press, which opens up
a new variable for printing card games. This new technology means that you’re printing 12
to 20 cards per sheet rather than 40 or more. With each piece of paper your cost goes up, so
designing a deck around the printing process can save you money. If it’s a 16 card process,
then make sure your deck size is a multiple of 16.
Unfortunately, POD suffers from one of the weaknesses of print and play. You aren’t
going to get any game parts, unless you source them separately and add them to the box
yourself. Therefore, as you design your game, you have to take into account what parts the
player may have on-hand.
POD also has no built-in distribution channel. You get a few copies printed in advance,
and then you have to sell them yourself to retailers, or individuals, or whomever.
Many of the bigger publishing companies have started using print on demand to make
prototypes of their games, or to get small runs of their new games manufactured to test sales
at trade shows. This advantage can also work for indie designers as they can get production
quality copies made for playtesting, or to ship to large publishers to be added to their line-up.
Web to Print Arrives
Recently, print on demand has evolved into something new called web to print (W2P),
which has completely changed the game for designers. For independent designers, W2P is
pretty much the best possible scenario. There is one company which set the standard for how
web to print game publishing works, The Game Crafter (www.thegamecrafter.com).
Full Disclosure: The author of this essay is one of the principal owners of The Game
Crafter, LLC.
The Game Crafter’s web-to-print process provides the same print quality you get with
print on demand, but your costs are a bit lower, and the process is much easier. Black and
white and color printing cost the same, which enables you to design whatever works best
for your game. You can choose to make one game at a time, or you can order in bulk. You
also get a wide selection of parts to flesh out your game, so your target player doesn’t need
to have anything on-hand. The Game Crafter also provides the flexibility of allowing you to
design cards, game boards, player mats, tiles, tokens, and instructions to meet the needs of
your game. When your game is ready, you can put your game up for sale right on their online
store and collect royalties.
The design process for web to print is a bit easier than POD. Instead of designing all your
pieces of art and then formatting them into some sort of printing/cutting template, you simply upload your artwork one piece at a time (or in bulk via FTP) and the software automatically positions your artwork in the best possible position to maximize quality and minimize
production costs. You also have digital proofing tools at your disposal, so you have a good

Designing Tabletop Games

idea of what each component is going to look like before you print anything. The Game
Crafter also provides a wide array of parts to choose from so you don’t need to make sacrifices when designing the mechanics of your game around the parts the players may have.
W2P also provides a built-in distribution mechanism in the form of an online store,
which is not available in POD or traditional vanity publishing. It’s still your responsibility to
market your game, to take it to trade shows and play it at game shops, but you don’t have to
worry about warehousing and shipping, and you get paid at the end of each month for the
copies you sell. Perhaps the best part is that you can still order copies at cost for yourself to
take to trade shows or to play with your friends.
W2P doesn’t have the weaknesses of print and play either. W2P allows you to easily make
physical prototypes during play testing. If your game becomes popular, it’s more likely to get
picked up by a large publisher, because the game was never released as a free PDF, and you
don’t have to try to set up your own e-commerce web site to sell it.
W2P’s only weaknesses come to light when compared to a traditional publishing print
run. The cost per unit is higher so you likely won’t be able to sell your game through traditional distribution channels. Also, you have to design your components to meet the sizes and
shapes that the W2P allows, which is less flexible than a traditional run. However, you have
no up-front costs or warehousing, and you don’t need to find a publisher willing to pick up
your game.
Making the Choice
Now that there are more ways to publish, you need to choose the publishing type that’s
right for you. In doing so you’ll need to take into account the pleasures and perils that each
has to offer. There’s no right or wrong answer, and you don’t even need to settle on one. Just
as many video game companies publish CDs to sell in brick and mortar stores and digital
copies to download from various online distributors, you too can implement more than one
publishing strategy. The important thing is that you know your options up front, and design
your game to fit within the constraints of your strategy.

SIMPLY KNIZIA – THE ART IN KEEPING GAME DESIGN SIMPLE
Kevin Jacklin

Reiner Knizia designs simple boardgames, easily learned and most playable in less than one
hour. However that does not necessarily mean that they are simplistic; the converse is often
true. Knizia designs are often richly themed, the themes deeply embedded into the game
mechanics. This article explores how Reiner Knizia game designs reflect a philosophy of sufficiency (“enough and no more”) that leaves space to promote social interactivity and enjoyment. Additionally, these deep designs reward players who are prepared to follow Knizia’s
lead into that play space and explore for themselves.
Playing games is instinctive for young minds. A reading of the Knizia ludography1 reveals that a large proportion of the games are children’s titles. By necessity these are simple
and straightforward games, usually with a single game mechanic – Kangaroo and Schildkrötenrennen being typical examples. To be successful, a game for children must relate to the
common experiences of young players: shopping baskets or animals or fruits or tractors or
dragons. That is to say, it must be highly thematic. A recognisable theme is part of the ‘way
in’ to the game.2 Once that theme is acknowledged and understood, then the game rules will
describe a simple underlying relation between the components (a shopping basket can hold
six bananas but only two pineapples). Game success comes with realising (learning) that
simple relation. The same goes for adult titles, but the underlying ideas are more nuanced.
Take the game Modern Art. Auctions are real-life activities that lend themselves to a natural game mechanic, and selling art at auction needs little explanation. Other games explore
the same theme. Modern Art, however, manages to reveal two more underlying truths: a
market in particular artists is created, thereby making the works of some more lucrative than
others; the auction process inherently lends itself to natural role-playing as each auctioneer

55

56

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

attempts to promote the artist they are selling. There isn’t even a rule for this – many players
do it naturally and unconsciously. Thus the players, by bringing something of themselves to
the game, make it a more social activity.
What Modern Art does so well is build an underlying structure that players are free to
expand, fill in, and explore among themselves. Arguably Modern Art is Knizia’s most successful role-playing game. The inclusion of excellent artwork on the cards adds positively
to the atmosphere, and helps promote the communal ‘willing suspension of disbelief’ that
good games engender. 3
Finding themes that are generally accessible to a broad audience is a balancing act. If the
theme is too obscure, sales will suffer. The very largest games manufacturers will usually
only countenance a new game that can either be explained in the course of a thirty-second
television commercial, or one which exploits an already popular licence. Knizia’s best-selling
game is Lord of the Rings, originally published by Parker/Hasbro.4 The game recreates the
struggle of Frodo and his companions to dispose of the One Ring without being overcome
by the corrupting influence of Sauron. It is successful in recreating the sense of overwhelming dread as great and dark forces wheel around the heads of the players, and as they are
challenged by a seemingly never-ending series of perilous events. The game above all – like
Tolkien’s novel – demonstrates that struggle and sacrifice for the good of the mission may
have to come before personal safety. The lavish game components and outstanding artwork
help put the players in a ‘Middle Earth’ frame of mind.
Lord of the Rings is probably at the complexity limit of a mass-market boardgame, since
learning to play it is perceived as somewhat daunting. Not only are there a large number
of components, but players are required to cooperate with each other. The strong theme,
however, incentivises new players to persevere with the rules and – once the basics are understood5 – Lord of the Rings plays straightforwardly. Discussions (or indeed disputes) among
the players (“You can’t be so selfish! If we don’t summon Gandalf, then Sauron will eat us for
breakfast!”) become the interesting issue, not the rules of game itself.6 It is only now, some
ten years after the first appearance of Lord of the Rings, that cooperative games are finding
some greater acceptance among the gaming public. It may be a little while longer before
a mass market breakthrough is achieved, although this may appear in the online console
market, as people learn to interact socially via the Wii and Playstation, rather than over a
boardgame.
Still popular among games players is Knizia’s second title, Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation, which is a ‘simple’ two-player game using few components and a small game board. It
recreates the ‘fog of war’ felt between the forces marshalled by good and evil in the War of
the Ring. Players have just nine tiles to represent their forces, and a very simplified map of
Middle Earth. Not an overwhelming set of materials, but it is sufficient to achieve its goal.
Most games last just twenty minutes, but by the finish players have had the experience of
an epic struggle - although the first reaction is often to want to have another attempt at vanquishing one’s foe.
What both Lord of the Rings titles demonstrate that that an epic theme does not require an
epic game length, nor hundreds of components. Knizia shows that a theme can be distilled
to an essential core, and that showing the essence is all that is needed. Knizia trusts players
with the imagination to ‘fill in the gaps’ for the remainder of their enjoyment, in the same
way that the pictures are better on radio. Those same gaps also leave room for the social
interaction that allows a game to breathe, and for players to bring something of themselves
to the table.7

Designing Tabletop Games

Where the theme is rich enough, with a variety of viewpoints that merit examination,
then it is possible to produce a series of games that explore different aspects of that theme.
Knizia has achieved this with merchant rivalry in Renaissance Italy in the Medici – Strozzi –
Bardi series. All of these use as their foundation the trading rivalry among the great houses
of Renaissance Italy, but each has its own distinct play mechanics and feel. We may not be
particularly surprised that writers and film-makers explore a subject from a variety of angles
(detective, historical and fantasy series abound), but it is a rare feat with popular boardgame
designers.8 There is a danger in taking an idea too far and stretching it ever-thin; movie sequels abound, and some mass-market game titles are constantly being repackaged. But with
care, a game publisher can make it easier to gain public acceptance by producing a series of
thematically linked game titles.
Knizia has recently taken a step further in producing a series of games linked not by
theme but by game mechanics – and these are purely abstract games. With almost no theme
to pull in the casual games player, abstract games are notoriously difficult for publishers
to market. The best-known example from Knizia must be Keltis 9 – but even this game was
delivered to the publisher as a themed boardgame.10 Kosmos 11 however believed that the
recognition factor for a Knizia title would be a sufficient draw in itself and – combined with
attractive artwork and some streamlining of the rules– would work better in the German
market.12 The consequent success of Keltis meant that it became widely-known in Germany
very quickly, thus Kosmos were confident in commissioning further titles from Knizia that
played variations on the original game mechanic. Knizia has ensured that all subsequent
titles have the Keltis feel, even though they play differently.13
If asked about his abstract games, Knizia is most enthusiastic about the Einfach Genial/
Ingenious series14, as these were purposely designed as abstract games (as opposed to the
happy accident of Keltis). Using a series of stock components (conjoined hex pieces with symbols printed on both sides) Kniza delights in the varying ways he can link these pieces (and
score them). Abstract games are not for everyone (but then, neither are roleplaying games or
sushi or Shakespeare); however for those willing to trust the designer and follow his lead,
working out the best way to set up a line of tiles while simultaneously blocking one’s opponents’ opportunities, can be very rewarding. These ‘sociable’ aspects still play a key part
even in the driest of abstract settings. For abstract designs, without the easy ‘way in’ offered
by a theme, the ‘extraneous’ factors of component quality, board, and box design become
even more important in the enjoyment of the game. There are currently four major Einfach
Genial15 titles published, but Knizia has (allegedly) even more waiting in the wings, such is
his enthusiasm for the opportunities that the Einfach Genial series affords.
Thus we have moved from enjoying the new perspective that a game can – via its mechanics – cast on a game world (which may be real or fictional), through to playing directly
with those mechanics. It’s the interconnections themselves that become interesting. Since
Knizia’s doctorate is in mathematical integration theory, we can understand why he enjoys
this aspect of games design. In Lord of the Rings Knizia is imparting to us the struggle of the
hobbits against an implacable foe; in Einfach Genial he is able to get players to start thinking
in terms of conceptual lines of power. Enjoyment can come in sharing the emotional predicament of the hobbits, and equally from the balancing of competing scoring imperatives.
It’s a cliché that abstract games can be simple to learn, but the best of them are notoriously difficult to master. The sparest of designs allow for the deepest game play. The best
of the Knizia titles demonstrate this. Where a theme is ‘deeply embedded’ (a very spare
design) there is some ambiguity over whether it is there intentionally. There is an ongoing
debate over whether Tigris and Euphrates is actually a war game, for example (“Where are the
armies?”).

57

58

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

Equally some Knizia game designs appear over a period of time (and geographies) with
a variety of themes ‘overlaid’ onto them – some more radically differing than others.16 Does
the fact that this can happen actually invalidate the theme? As has been noted above, some
theme is useful in attracting the casual player into the game initially and so is valuable in
that context at least. One argument often overlooked, however, is that the same underlying
structure can inform more than one theme. In literature it has been said that there are only
seven basic plots, but the book trade shows no signs of stopping after just seven novels! Some
of the more intriguing insights come when comparing two themes by using the same structure, or in some cases exactly the same words.17 Gem Dealer has recently reinterpreted the
original mechanism of Attacke, but both games work well on their own terms.
In the design process, Knizia will frequently devise an interesting game mechanic, and
then search for themes with which to relate it. Often a mechanic hints at more than one potential theme, and some thought needs to be applied as to which will be most suitable. In the
best instances, a good theme goes on to inform further refinements of the game mechanic.
In some cases a theme is temporarily attached to a design (usually to establish the ‘way in’
to the game, as described above) before another theme subsequently emerges. Early versions
of a mountain expedition design eventually were replaced by a ‘golden-age’ movie-making
theme and resulted ultimately in Traumfabrik. It takes a strong imagination now to envisage
anything other than a Hollywood background to that design.18 Thus a design informs the
theme and vice versa.
That’s not to say that Knizia will always start a game design with a mechanic in mind.
In many cases the theme will be the first inspiration. Knizia’s design vault contains many
unused/discarded/undeveloped mechanics waiting for the day when a theme needs one.
The majority of commissions undertaken by Knizia are theme-led; it is rare indeed for a publisher to request a purely abstract design.19 Knizia has, however, had some recent success in
persuading publishers to take on a non-commissioned abstract design.20
Whether theme- or design-led, Knizia’s aim is always to provide a framework that players
can enjoy. Success is achieved when players have consciously forgotten the game rules, and
start playing within that framework space. This is analogous to learning to ride a bicycle or
operating a videogame controller, or becoming totally absorbed in a book or a movie; the delivery mechanism becomes secondary to the experience. Enjoyment is subjective of course;
those who thrive on the cut and thrust of the auctioneering world in Modern Art may not be
the same as those who enjoy mastering the lines of power within Einfach Genial. However, it
is through simple, natural, and elegant game rules that Knizia ensures that barriers to enjoyment are kept to a minimum, so that everyone has the opportunity to share Knizia’s vision.
With the best Knizia designs, the nuances of the game only begin to reveal themselves
after several plays, despite the game’s apparent simplicity. For those players who are prepared to follow Knizia’s lead, diligently and patiently aiming towards achieving mastery of
a game, going with the flow to see where it takes them, the results can be extremely fulfilling.

2 Conveying the theme successfully to the players relies on a combination of factors; including the quality of the

components and playing pieces, attractive artwork, and box design. These, together with commonality of experience/purpose, provide the ‘gateway’ for gameplay and merit a separate discussion.
3 Modern Art has been published in a variety of editions, many with different works of art. The most recent is
Masters Gallery (Gryphon Games, 2009) which utilises 30 ‘classic’ paintings from Van Gogh, Renoir and others.
4 The original Lord of the Rings commission came from Sophisticated Games of Cambridge, England.
5 The basics of Lord of the Rings are most easily and rapidly learned under demonstration conditions (i.e. someone
in the group has played it before).
6 There is a point in every game where its mechanics are learned sufficiently well to allow social interactions to

take place, and the theme to emerge more strongly. The height of such a bar, the game designer’s intent (or otherwise) in setting it, and its appropriateness in relation to the theme, game setting and marketplace are the basis of
a separate discussion.
7 The debate between the US-centric ‘card/pawn for everything’ vs. the Euro-game ‘less is more’ philosophy is a
lively one, and won’t be resolved any time soon.
8 Knizia does not always succeed: the ‘missing’ quarter of the board in Beowulf – the Legend hints that he has more
to say on the subject than was allowed for in the original publication.
9 Keltis – awarded the 2008 Spiel des Jahres in Germany.

10 Lost Cities – the Boardgame was published in the US in its original incarnation. The US publisher Rio Grande felt
a theme (as well as being an already well-known and popular game) would be more suited for the domestic US
market.
11 Kosmos Verlag, of Stuttgart Germany, is a large boardgame publisher. Kosmos released the original two-player

Lost Cities in 1999, subsequently licensing it to other publishers around the world.
12 German spielwaren (games stores) are known to promote some games with their designer’s name prominently

displayed on the shelves, in the same way that bookstores do for their authors. Knizia game titles from the very
beginning have almost always had their designer’s name on the box, thus promoting recognition.
13 Ironically the very large success of Keltis in Germany meant a change of plan for other markets. Originally
Keltis was destined for Germany only, with the rest of the world going with Lost Cities – the Boardgame, which after
all had some existing recognition, and would likely benefit from the association. Such was the positive publicity
generated by the Spiel des Jahres, however, that it became clear it would be a better commercial decision to also
publish Keltis in markets outside of Germany.
14 Knizia is a doctor of mathematics; its disciplines underlie all his designs. With Einfach Genial he enjoys ‘playing’

with pieces unconstrained by thematic requirements.
15 The original game, then Einfach Genial-Knobelspass (puzzle game), Einfach Genial-Kartenspiel (card game) and
Genial Spezial. Ingenious Challenges, published in the US by Fantasy Flight Games, incorporates the card game along
with a dice game and tile challenge. There is also a two-player Travel Edition, Einfach Genial-Mitbringspiel (minigame), Einfach Genial Junior a CD-ROM and hand-held computer versions.
16 Honeybears and Bucket Brigade share an identical game mechanism, but have very different thematic interpretations.
17 Shakespeare is extraordinarily adaptable. Insights are found when setting Henry V in modern day Iraq; or by

transforming The Tempest into the movie Forbidden Planet.
18 Subsequent versions of Traumfabrik from other publishers have all used a movie-making theme, albeit with
more contemporary Hollywood setting.
19 Even Einfach Genial/Ingenious came about as a request to design a game suitable for the British Mensa society,
and was originally published under the title Mensa Connections.
20 FITS and Callisto were both published in 2009.

FILTERING FEEDBACK
Ira Fay

One thing I love about being a game designer is getting feedback. Of course, I hate that
sometimes too, but most of the time, receiving feedback is an ultimately helpful experience.
The sting of critique passes quickly if it leads to a better game, especially when given honestly and with good intentions. While it is impossible to make a game that appeals to everyone,
playtesting is a vital tool in a designer’s toolbox, and should be used generously at all stages
of development.
Currently, my favorite boardgame is Agricola by Uwe Rosenberg (number two on boardgamegeek.com as of this writing). Agricola is a one- to five-player game in which players take
on the role of 17th century farmers, striving to feed their families and build a large farm. It is
a fairly complex Eurogame and takes approximately two hours to play. In this article, I will
spend only a little time explaining the rules of Agricola. If you are not already familiar with
the game, you can read the rules online.21 Furthermore, any aspiring boardgame designer
should be familiar with the Top Ten games on boardgamegeek.com!
Agricola was originally published with four different decks, and several more decks have
now been published. I recently had the pleasure of being a designer for a crowd-sourced expansion, the G deck (Gamers deck). In this article, I will analyze what makes Agricola great
and then discuss how I strove to make it even better with the G deck expansion. I will also
cover the role of player feedback in our development, and how you can use it to improve
your games.
As Lewis Pulsipher notes in his article on the Three Player Problem,22 most Eurogames,
including Agricola, resolve the king-making problem by limiting direct player conflict. Fortunately, players still interact and are faced with interesting decisions. Within the genre of
Eurogames, Agricola is great for many reasons, which I have grouped into five categories:

61

62

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

• Lots of content
• Excellent theme
• Supports one to five players
• Multiple paths to victory
• High replayability
Content
The first thing that most new players notice when they open the box, is that there are
many bits and pieces. Agricola contains 360 cards and approximately 400 other markers,
counters, and tiles. While there is some risk that the player might feel overwhelmed, most
players who are trying out Agricola for the first time are open to complex Eurogames. The
player is most likely excited to explore all the possibilities. When I play Agricola with my
friends, we still discover cards or combinations that we have never seen before, even after
dozens of games. The sheer volume of content included in the game creates excitement for
the players. Obviously all the different cards contribute to high replayability as well.
There are many excellent boardgames that have minimalistic content, such as Go or any
game played with a standard deck of cards. Therefore, you should not feel compelled to create games that have lots of content. On the other hand, if you do choose to include unique
cards, ensure that you include enough to keep games fresh and interesting.
Agricola also has excellent attention to detail in all the cards. For example, there are house
tiles that everyone uses; if you look closely, some of those tiles show people playing Agricola
in their house! Another example is that the art for the Scholar card matches with the Bookcase. Throughout the game, observant players will be pleasantly surprised.
Theme
Agricola is well-themed. All elements of game play are related to farming, which is fun
for players because it makes it easier to learn the game and to deduce basic strategy. The cohesiveness of the game rules is elegant and pleasing. Furthermore, the game includes good
iconography, consistent language and keywords. For any game, it’s important to employ
systems, images, and words that help players learn and retain the rules.
For example, players score points in many ways, including having vegetables at the end
of the game. Vegetables are a relatively small part of the game, but all of the following cards
are related to vegetables: Bean Field, Turnip Field, Lettuce Patch, Giant Pumpkin, Pumpkin
Seed Oil, Greenhouse, Schnaps Distiller, Schnaps Distillery, and many more. It makes sense
that those cards relate to vegetables, simply based on their card names. Such strong theming
facilitates learning for new players, and helps them retain what they learn.
One to Five Players
By allowing one to five players per game, Agricola can be played in many different situations. Furthermore, due to some small but significant changes in the setup, the game plays
very differently depending on the number of players, which also promotes replayability.
When designing your games, it’s valuable to consider the number of players required to play.
The greater the range, the more valuable the game is to your players, since they will be able
to play it in more situations.

Designing Tabletop Games

Of course, the catch is that the game must still be fun regardless of how many players
are playing, within the advertised range. This is one area where playtesting can be valuable. When you are designing your games, try experimenting with the number of players
required to play. Stretch your boundaries and see what happens. Through playtesting, you
can refine the gameplay for a varied number of players.
Multiple Paths to Victory
Agricola also excels at providing players many different strategic options, all of which
are viable under the right circumstances. While some strategies tend to win over others,
the player generally enjoys a sense of freedom in choosing his or her strategy. Experienced
players tend to use a draft variation of the setup, which gives even more opportunities to
customize strategy.
Multiple paths to victory are only possible if each path is well-balanced against the other
options. In my experience, such precise balance is only possible through playtesting and
iteration. The original game had 138 playtesters credited,23 with approximately 200 playtest
games.24 That amount of feedback allowed Uwe to fine tune each card and strategy to be
balanced against each other. I mentioned the benefits of massive content above; while it’s
certainly great for the players, balancing all those cards and ensuring they are fun will add
design time, which is important to consider for your development timeline.
High Replayability
Strategic depth and variation, lots of content, diversity of number of players needed to
play, and some randomness all combine to yield a high level of replayability in Agricola.
Every game has exactly fourteen rounds, and in each round a new action becomes available
to the players. The new actions appear in a slightly different order each game. That small
variation creates a large impact on gameplay, which is elegant, fun, and results in greater
replayability.
The G Deck
Now that I have extolled the virtues of the basic version of Agricola, I’d like to discuss the
G deck expansion, and how a group of dedicated fans set out to make a great game even
better. One particularly dedicated fan created an online implementation of the game (with
permission), and a community began to form (play-agricola.com). As the site caught on, the
players started creating new cards for fun. Soon, Uwe noticed the momentum and requested
a full expansion. Each designer had his or her own reasons for participating, but I got involved for the sheer fun of it. My goals for the expansion included:
• Have fun during the design process
• Increase strategic depth by providing interesting, new choices
• Improve game balance to increase possible winning strategies
Have Fun Designing
It can be a challenge to design a game under any circumstances; it’s especially difficult to
design with sixty-six other people! The amount of feedback that everyone generated during
development was nearly overwhelming. In nine and a half months of design, we had sixtyseven people discussing the cards, 311 playtesters, over 1300 games played, and more than
5400 forum posts.25

63

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

Any idea that is tested by so many games and players will tend to lose its rough edges
and end up more polished. Certainly our final product was far from perfect. Nonetheless,
the process of convincing other people about the value of a particular design tends to yield
good results, as long as the people involved in the discussion are committed to quality, are
well-informed, and have good judgment. In the case of our expansion, I believe that to generally be the case.
To share ideas, each proposed card had its own discussion thread in the forums. Anyone
could comment on the card, and each person got one vote per card: yes or no. It was a pure
democracy, with the most popular ideas making the final deck. Once we picked the top 125
cards, we had several months of fine-tuning with those cards to ensure they worked well
together and with the previously published decks.
There were many times during development that someone would propose an idea for a
new card, and the feedback on the forum was disparate. It quickly became obvious who had
playtested with the card and who had not. From the beginning, designers could watch live
games in progress, and we built additional tools that let us replay games asynchronously
and link to them on the forums. Once everyone playtested the card, we reached consensus
much more quickly. It was easy to filter out feedback from anyone who had not actually seen
the card played in a game.
When designing your games, it’s important to gather lots of feedback from many different players. As you use the feedback to make design changes, ensure that you give the
most weight to feedback from people who actually played the game, and people who fit your
target audience.
Increase Strategic Depth
To increase strategic depth, we created a few new mechanics, while still remaining true
to the original game. Since the basic version was so well liked, we did not want to stray too
far. For example, there is no auction mechanic in the original game; I designed a card that
introduced a small auction that awards resources to players, yet does so in a way that is consistent with other cards from the original game.
For example, here is the original card text that I proposed:
Auctioneer, Occupation (4+ players)
Place 4 Wood, 4 Clay, and 3 Stone on rounds 7, 9 and 11, respectively. At the start of these
rounds, all other Players (starting with the starting player) bid once in Food for the resources
(no ties allowed.) The highest bidder gets the resources and you get the Food.
When we playtested this card, we found that a player would rarely play this occupation
for fear of giving other players too large a benefit. Therefore, I changed it to:
Auctioneer, Occupation (4+ players)
Place 4 Wood, 4 Clay, and 3 Stone on rounds 7, 9 and 11, respectively. At the start of these
rounds, all players simultaneously bid Food for the resources (place Food in your hand, then
reveal simultaneously.) The highest bidder gets the resources and you get the Food. If you
win, pay your Food to the supply. Ties are broken in player order. (The starting player wins
all ties.)
This second revision increased speed of play since the auction is simultaneous, and also
allows the Auctioneer to bid on the resources. The drawback of the change was longer card
text, but it was within reasonable limits. When we tested the second version, we found that
it got played more; it was still too weak because large piles of resources didn’t command
large enough prices. We solved that by having 4 smaller auctions. Here is the final version:

Designing Tabletop Games

Auctioneer, Occupation (4+ players)
Place 2 Reed, 3 Wood, 3 Clay, and 2 Stone on rounds 7, 9, 11 and 13, respectively. At the
start of these rounds, all players simultaneously bid Food for the resources (players secretly
place Food in their hands, then reveal.) The highest bidder gets the resources and you get
the Food. If you win, pay your Food to the supply. Ties are broken in player order. (Starting
player wins all ties.)
Improve Game Balance
As you might anticipate, the players who sought out this project were some of the most
hardcore players of Agricola on the planet. There was general consensus among us that
certain strategies were slightly weaker than others, and therefore we used the G deck to
make the weaker strategies more viable. For example, we felt that baking and early fences
were slightly too weak, and therefore we created several cards that benefit those strategies
(Baker’s Daughter, Carrot Cake Baker, Fence Helper, Hoe Maker, Hammer, and more). I hope
that we succeeded in improving the game balance, and I feel confident with our final tuning
considering all the playtesting data we examined. Of course, no game is ever perfect, and I
look forward to even more Agricola expansions in the future.
Keep it Simple
When advanced players create new designs or give feedback on existing designs, they
may develop overly complex rules. This pitfall can also catch game designers, who are likely
the most experienced players of their own games. During development of the G deck, we
were careful to keep new ideas as simple as possible. When addressing feedback on game
balance, strive to avoid exceptions and special cases when a simplification would work just
as well. For example, here is the original text of the Headmaster occupation:
Headmaster, Occupation (3+ players)
Whenever another player plays an Occupation using an occupation space, place the Food
paid on this card. Whenever you play an Occupation, you must pay using Food from this
card if possible, otherwise you pay normally. At the end of the game, you receive Bonus
points equal to the number of Food remaining on this card divided by the number of opponents, rounded up.
As you can see, that text has complex restrictions about how the food must be paid, and
how it’s scored at the end. The core idea is great: an occupation that benefits directly from
other people playing occupations. While there were some occupation-related cards in the
original game, this idea is new and interesting. Through playtesting and iteration, the final
text was streamlined as follows:
Headmaster, Occupation (4+ players)
Whenever another player plays an Occupation, place 1 Food from the supply on this card.
Whenever you play an Occupation, you may pay any costs using Food from this card. At the
end of a 4/5 player game, you receive 1 Bonus point for every 3/4 Food on this card.

As a final example of the value of simplicity and the challenges of collaborative design,
here is the text of a G deck card:
Shared Wall, Minor Improvement
Your home now creates a natural border for pasture(s). You may not extend your home into
pastures created in this way. You may still build all 15 fences.
This card was the fourth most-debated card in the set, and here was the alternate text we
considered:
Shared Wall, Minor Improvement
Any fences you build that are adjacent to your home cost no wood.
When we playtested this card, a few players were confused by the first text, but it is slightly more powerful. I argued for the latter text because it is shorter and simpler, even though
it is slightly weaker. In the end, I was out-voted because most designers felt like the first text
was sufficiently easy to understand. Which would you have picked?
When designing your next game, I hope that you will find some these concepts helpful.
Playtesting and gathering feedback from your players will be your most reliable tool to balance and polish your game.

15 GAMES IN 15 YEARS
Stone Librande

Making Games
For as long as I can remember I have been making my own card and board games. One of
my earliest game design memories is converting a box of my father’s old business cards into a
random boardgame generator. On the blank side of each card I scribbled simple instructions
such as “Move ahead 4 spaces” and “Lose 2 turns”. My friends and I would shuffle the huge
deck and then lay out the cards in a long winding trail that swerved along the concrete floor
of the basement.
As I grew older I continued making my own games as a hobby. In junior high I made scifi games based on Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica. In high school I designed entire fantasy
worlds and adventures for our Dungeons and Dragons group. (I was not interested in roleplaying a character; I always wanted to be the dungeon master.)
After college my passion for games led me to a career in the videogame industry, where I
am currently employed as a designer. Every day I work with a talented team of programmers
and artists, using the latest technologies in an attempt to produce the next hit game that will
be played by hundreds of thousands of people. A typical videogame production involves
years of work, millions of dollars, and the coordinated effort of more than a hundred creative
and brilliant people. But I find more personal satisfaction working alone late nights on my
own small games, using only cardstock, an X-Acto knife and a bottle of white glue. Many of
these games are designed for an audience of two: my sons.
The first of these games was for my two-year old son. It was a simple color matching
game that we made together to celebrate Christmas. I did not know it at the time, but that
was the beginning of an annual tradition—what we now call the “Christmas Game.” For

69

70

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

each of the next fourteen Christmases I would continue to design and build a new game,
wrap it up, and place it under the tree. On Christmas morning I would watch anxiously as
my sons opened the present and examined the pieces. Then we would spend several hours
on Christmas afternoon playing the game and modifying the rules in response to the kids’
feedback.
What follows is a brief description of the fifteen Christmas Games that were constructed
over the last fifteen years. I am not including the actual rules to the games (that would take
up far too many pages). Instead I will focus on the design philosophies, production techniques, and core mechanics of each game. It is important to note that these games were not
meant to be sold or published. My goal was not profit. The only motivation was to create
age-appropriate games that could be enjoyed by the entire family.
Hidden Reindeers
My two-year old son, Jordan, was interested in all the Christmas decorations that my
wife had placed around the house. To his dismay, he was constantly hearing, “Don’t touch
that!” as he explored the fragile ornaments, the blinking lights, and the ceramic Nativity
figures. To keep his little hands busy I got out some construction paper, paint, a few bottles
of colored glitter glue, and a small wooden reindeer figure. We spent the next hour playing
in the sparkling mess.
When we had finished I took three of Jordan’s masterpieces and rolled each of them into
a cone. Then I placed the reindeer, now painted red, under one of them and asked, “Where’s
the reindeer?” He pointed at the correct cone. “You win!” I exclaimed, as I lifted up the cone.
I put the cone back down. This time I mixed them up before I asked him to find the reindeer.
I was proud to see him point it out on his first try.
This game was too easy. I decided to add in a few new rules to see if he could handle some
extra complexity. We got a second wooden reindeer and painted it green. Then I cut out a
small cardboard disk and Jordan squirted red glitter glue on one side and green on the other.
After our new pieces had dried, I put the two reindeer under two different cones, shuffled
them around and had him toss the coin into the air. “Red!” I exclaimed as the coin landed
on the table. “Where’s the red reindeer?” It took him a short while before he understood the
relationship between the coin, the cones and the colored reindeer, but with each coin flip his
success rate steadily improved.
We played Hidden Reindeers for short bursts throughout the holiday season. Then it was
packed up in early January along with the rest of the decorations, stored in the attic, and
forgotten for the next eleven months. But every December it comes back out of the box and I
am reminded of the simple fun that we had with the first Christmas Game.
Fishin’
The next year I was looking forward to making a new game, but I wanted to do something less spontaneous and more elaborate. I decided to construct a fishing game that Jordan
could play from his bed, as if he were fishing from a rowboat out at sea. The game featured
a colorful fishing pole (a hand-painted lime green dowel) from which dangled a thin rope
anchored with a magnetic disk. There was also an assortment of wooden pieces such as a
starfish, a shark, an angelfish, a boot, and a tire. Hammered into each piece was a largeheaded nail which acted as an attractor when the magnetic hook was near.
The idea seemed simple enough. I had seen similar fishing playsets in the toy store, but
they were cheaply made out of one-colored molded plastic. I wanted to make something
more solid and unique. Something durable enough to last for a generation. Unfortunately, I

Designing Tabletop Games

quickly discovered that my intentions were far beyond my capabilities. I had neither enough
money nor space for a jigsaw. Luckily, my father has a large, well-supplied workshop in his
basement and my mother is a whiz with a jigsaw, so I was able to enlist their help. I sent off
a copy of my illustrations for her to use as a template and, a week later, the perfectly cut
wooden pieces arrived in the mail. That was the easy part.

Fig. 1: The template illustration that was used to create the wooden pieces.

I also had to build the pole, which turned out to be frustratingly difficult. A fishing pole
seems like such a basic object until you try to build one from scraps in your garage. I started
with the obvious piece – a long length of wooden dowel – but problems arose right away.
What is the reel made of? How is the reel attached to the rod? How does it turn without falling off? Is it easy enough for a three-year old to operate? Is it strong enough to survive a play
session with a three-year old? There were so many problems that I was still trying to piece it
all together after midnight on Christmas Eve.
Despite the mechanical troubles, and the late night crunch session, the game components
came out fine. There were no formal rules to accompany them, but that did not matter. That
night Jordan and I fished off his bed and we created our own challenges as we played. Who
can hook the blue fish first? How many fish can you catch before you catch a shark? Try to
catch something while your eyes are closed.
We never did make any official rules for Fishin’, and I am convinced there should never
be any. It is a game about experimentation and camaraderie, not score keeping or adhering
to rules.
Alpha Zoo-tauri
Jordan was just beginning to read and I wanted to make him a game that would help him
learn the alphabet. More importantly, I wanted to avoid a big production (and the associated
problems) that had tripped me up the previous year. It was time to go back to basics. Armed
with a large black piece of poster board and some trusty bottles of glitter glue, I enlisted Jordan as the lead artist for another boardgame art project.
I marked out twenty-six areas on the poster board and helped Jordan “draw” multicolored swirls that represented planets, asteroids and nebulae. Next to each one I wrote a letter
from A to Z. Then we connected the neighboring stellar objects together with a crisscross

web of “hyperlines” that were used for traveling through the galaxy. I purchased a deck of
alphabet animal flash cards to represent the beasts we were trying to capture for our personal intergalactic zoos. Two matchbox-sized spaceships, taken from a drawer of loose toys,
were used to mark our positions on the map.
The rules, as with all of the games described in this chapter, evolved as we played. Jordan’s feedback and opinions were the ones that mattered most. (His younger brother, Dylan,
who was now only one, would soon begin expressing his opinion, too.) If the play mechanics
were too simplistic then they were made more complex. Features that caused laughter and
engagement were strengthened, while confusing and tedious mechanics were rapidly eliminated. This interactive form of game design is the main reason that the Christmas Games are
strong reflections of the children’s developing cognitive personalities.
The goal of Alpha Zoo-tauri is to collect the majority of the twenty-six animals. The flash
cards are shuffled and the top three are revealed and placed on the matching alphabet letter
(Elephant on “E”, Ostrich on “O”, and Donkey on “D”). On your turn you move your ship
along one hyperline, moving from one sector to the next. If you land on an animal you pick
it up, add it to your zoo, and place a new random animal from the deck into the appropriate
