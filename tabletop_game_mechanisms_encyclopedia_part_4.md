Command Cards

Description
Players have a hand of cards that allows them to activate and perform actions
with a subset of their units.

Discussion
Players have a hand of cards that represent different geographic regions or unit
types and must play one each turn. When a geographic region card is played,
units that are located in the region(s) indicated on the card may take Actions.
If a Unit Type card is played, only units of that type may take Actions.
For example, in Memoir ’44 the cards may represent left flank, right
flank, center, or unit combinations, for example, all Tank units. Players have
an indication of their future range of actions based on the cards in their
hands, which allows for a level of planning. Hand size limits help define the
information horizon and amount of look-ahead players can engage in.

In a traditional war game, players can take actions with all of their units
each turn. Command Card systems limit this to a subset of units, which
reduces the length of turns, and simplifies decision-making, giving the game
a lighter feel.
Some games, like Risk: Star Wars Edition, give players a range of one to
three possible activation choices, building in greater flexibility and planning.
In the extreme limit, with one unit at a time being activated, this mechanism
reduces to a Chit Draw system (TRN-11).

Action Queue

Description
Players create Action Queues and perform them in sequence.

Discussion
While this mechanism has many different implementations, at its core, the
idea is that players must plan their actions and commit to a specific sequence
of execution. For example, players may have to plot the movement of a robot
by placing three Action cards in sequence that may, for example, cause the
robot to move forward two spaces, then turn left, then move one more space.
The types of actions, the way they are revealed and resolved, and other
specifics have several variations.
Action Queues emphasize planning, but can also introduce chaos, as
players commit to a course of action several steps or turns in advance,
keep them hidden from the other players, and have limited opportunity to
change the plan. This introduces Yomi (UNC-01), as players try to guess
what other players will do and what the board state may look like in the
future.
Actions are typically represented by cards, as they can contain a lot of
information about the preconditions and resolution. Tiles can also be used
but need to be simpler. Queues can either be Rolling, where the Action at the
head of the queue is revealed and performed as a new Action is added to the

Actions

83

end, or Batch, where a set number of cards are added to the queue at one time,
and then all are resolved in order.
One of the earliest uses of a Rolling Queue is the 1965 game Nuclear War.
In this game, each player has a queue of two cards in front of them. On their
turn, they add a card to the end of the queue, and then turn up and execute
the card at the queue head. In Nuclear War the players start at peace and
may perform certain peace actions, but when someone launches a missile,
only war actions may be taken. The delayed Action Queue gives the game
tremendous tension, as players need to decide if they can continue to perform
peace actions or want to be the first to declare war.
RoboRally uses a Batch Queue. The players fully plan an entire series of
actions and then resolve them using an Interleaved turn structure, with each
player revealing and performing the action in the first slot, then each player
doing the second action, etc. Swashbuckler, instead of cards, has players record
their actions in blocks of six time steps on a record sheet. Players then resolve
each time step in a similar way.
Robo Rally only allows for the players to queue Movement actions, with
others (like shooting) being done on-the-fly as the opportunity permits. In
contrast, Swashbuckler allows players a full suite of movement, combat, and
other actions.
Twin Tin Bots uses a Batch Queue approach, but the entire queue does
not get replaced at once. Players may only replace one Action in the queue
each turn. The others remain and are performed. This obviously adds more
complexity to the programming step as players need to play further ahead
about how they may change of their queues. Mechs vs. Minions is a similar
example of this system.
When queues get longer, and particularly when movement and rotation
actions are included in the available actions, this mechanism may require
good spatial relations in the players, as they need to visualize where they will
be as they progress through the queue. This can give games a heavier feel,
while at the same time increasing the chaotic feel. This combination may not
be well received by some players, although some games, like Robo Rally and
Space Alert, rely on this for their experience.
Other games, like Colt Express, address this challenge by limiting the
overall movement space. In Colt Express players can move to the head or rear
of a short train of cars, or between the inside and the top of those cars. Each
player can move to one of three spaces per turn, and the whole board is about
ten spaces (depending on player count), increasing the likelihood of player
collisions and interactions.

Root has a unique take on the Action Queue, as one of the factions must
add a new Action to the queue each turn (in any position) and perform all the
Actions in sequence. If an Action cannot be executed, the player loses victory
points, and all Action cards are discarded. Another variation is in Valparaiso.
Players simultaneously plan their actions in a queue, and then execute them in
order. However, as the turn unfolds they may pay gold to perform an action
in their queue sooner than planned.

Shared Action Queue

Description
All players add Actions to a central Action Queue. Actions in the Queue are
performed by all players.

Discussion
This is a variation on the standard Action Queue mechanism. Here, on their
turn a player adds one or more Actions to the end of a queue shared by all
players, and then executes the full queue from start to finish. This system
increases interactivity, as players are planning actions not just for themselves,
but also for their opponents. It gives a different flavor of strategic options,
as players attempt to plan actions that will benefit them more than their
opponents. Sequencing may also play a role, as the action queue may not set
up certain players to perform actions as they may be out of position for an
earlier action, a deficiency that cascades throughout the queue.
The two-player game Major General: Duel of Time takes this a step further
by including two actions on each card played, one for each player. It is also
unique in that actions may be placed anywhere in the queue, not just at the
end. After playing an action, the player executes actions from the end of the
queue closest to them. On their opponent’s turn, they will resolve the actions
in the opposite order, and using the other actions on the cards.

Each turn in Mottainai a player plays a card in front of them that allows
the taking of a particular action. However, before performing it the player
first performs the actions in front of each opponent, going clockwise and
ending with themselves. This is similar to Follow (ACT-08), except that the
opponent’s chosen actions are executed on your turn, not on the opponent’s
turn.
A variation on a Shared Action Queue is used in Kraftwagen, which has
a queue of action tokens, trailed by a queue of player markers. The person at
the end of the queue may move to any position to take and execute an Action.
However, the further ahead the person moves, the longer it will be until they
are once again at the end, and in position to take a new action. Kraftwagen
blends a Shared Action Queue with a Time Track (TRN-13).

Follow

Description
One player selects an Action. Other players may then perform that Action,
or a modified version of it. This is closely related to Action Drafting (ACT02) and Role Selection (TRN-10), and is often implemented alongside those
systems.

Discussion
Follow mechanisms are a form of Action Selection that have a high degree
of player involvement. Puerto Rico is a good example. On their turn, a player
selects one of the available roles, and executes the action associated with it.
Then, in turn, each player gets to execute the role. The player who selected
the role also gets a bonus to their action. For example, the player who selects
Builder gets a discount on the cost of construction and performs the action
first. The other players then each perform the Builder action, paying the
normal cost.
This mechanism forces players to consider not just what they want to do,
but what will be good for their opponents. Does someone really need to build?
Perhaps picking Builder is not the best choice. Can someone only build if they
get the discount? Then selecting Builder, even if it helps other players too, may

88

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

be the best option. Players need to look holistically at everyone’s position, not
just their own.
A variation on this mechanism can be found in Glory to Rome and SPQF.
In these games, Actions are taken by playing a card from the hand, which are
in certain suits. Other players may echo the action if they play one or more
cards matching the suit. In this way, the players that are echoing may end up
performing more powerful versions of the actions by discarding several cards.
It also means that if players cannot match the action, they may not echo it.
Since players’ hands are hidden in these games, this makes determining the
best option somewhat of a guessing game. But careful attention will show
what may be useful to other players, and what cards they may have collected.
Follow systems of this sort introduce a cost to the follow action. In Eminent
Domain, players may Follow by discarding cards of the same suit, which
further power the action. Because the game is a deck-builder, the cards spent
from hand are only an opportunity cost, as they will eventually be shuffled
back into the player’s deck. In Tiny Epic Galaxies, players must spend a
Culture resource to follow, which is a more concrete cost.
In Mottainai, players, on their turn, may perform the actions that the
other players played on their prior turn. Unlike other Follow mechanism
implementations, this one calls for a batch execution of the sequence of
actions, rather than an Interleaved system.
Generally, Follow systems are excellent at keeping players engaged on every
turn, since players act, or have potential to act, on every turn. However, they
may also slow down play, since players have to decide on every single turn
whether they wish to Follow and how. Designers are encouraged to include
some physical token to keep track of who the active player is, too, since the
interleaving of player actions inside each active player’s turn can lead to turnorder confusion.

Order Counters

Description
Players place Order Tokens into regions, indicating what they want to do
in that particular region of the board. After all tokens are placed, they are
executed in sequence.

Discussion
This mechanism combines an Interleaved Turn Structure (TRN-15) with
an Action Queue. Players are in essence creating multiple Interleaved Action
Queues during a planning step, and then resolving them. The tokens are
typically placed face down, so opponents know where you are planning to do
actions, but not which, and if more than one order may be given, tokens are
placed in a stack to indicate their sequence.
Because players alternate placing orders into different areas, they must
balance a variety of factors. Which actions do they wish to do early? Will
committing to a region alert an opponent to your intentions to operate there?
What action are the opponents planning?
The resolution of the Order Token stacks can be performed in several
ways. First, they may either be resolved from the top down, so that tokens
that were placed last are resolved first (LIFO: Last-In-First-Out), or the token

90

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

stack may be flipped over, so that the earliest tokens are resolved first (FIFO:
First-In-First-Out). Some games (like A Game of Thrones: The Board Game),
don’t consider the placement order of the tokens, and simply turn them all
over and resolve them in a specific Action order.
Resolution order has great impact on the strategy and feel for placement.
LIFO gives the game a “chicken” feel, as players want to be the last into a
region with key actions so that they are executed first, but it also increases
cognitive load, as players need to remember the reverse order of tokens in the
stack and modify their plans as they go. With a FIFO structure, players can
gradually just build up their plans in their minds as they proceed, which is
less cognitively taxing.
Either way, this is a moderately complex mechanism which is best reserved
for heavier strategy games.

Rondel

Description
The available Actions are represented as pie wedges in a circle. Each player
has one or more tokens on Rondel’s wedges. On their turn, they may move
their token around the Rondel and perform the Action indicated by the wedge
where they stop. It is typically more costly to move further around the Rondel.

Discussion
This mechanism is related to a basic Action Point system (ACT-01), as the
Rondel represents a menu of available actions. However, the cost of the actions
varies for each turn, as to move more than one space typically incurs some
cost (money or some other currency). If a player wishes to move one space at
a time, they incur little cost, but may not be most efficiently performing the
actions.
Rondel systems emphasize trade-offs, planning, and efficiency, as players
need to balance taking the action that they want to do now, and paying a
cost, with waiting and paying no or a reduced cost.
There are several variations on this mechanic. In Finca, players have several
tokens on the Rondel, and may choose one of them to move. The distance
that it may move is based on the number of tokens in the starting wedge, and
the power of the action is determined by the number of tokens in the ending
wedge. This makes for a highly interactive yet relatively simple system, and
also begins to blur with a Mancala mechanism (MOV-12).

Action Selection Restrictions

Description
Players are restricted from which actions they may choose.

Discussion
There are a wide variety of mechanisms that have been used to force players
to choose less than optimal actions, or even ones that are detrimental. Some
of the more popular mechanisms have been included in their own section:
Action Drafting, Action Retrieval, Rondels, and Command Cards are all
examples. However, there are a wide variety of approaches to this that have
been used in only one game. Several of these are collected in this section.
In Kemet, the possible actions are laid out in a pyramid. Players must select
at least one option from each pyramid level. In Goa, action tiles are laid out
on a grid. The start player places a marker on the grid, taking that tile. Each
player in turn then places their marker adjacent to the previous one played,
onto another tile, either orthogonally or diagonally. Players need to consider
how they may be helping their opponent by placing next to a tile they need.
In Noria, players place action tokens on concentric wheels. Only tokens in
certain portions of the wheels may be used, and the wheels rotate at different
speeds. Tzolk’ in: The Mayan Calendar also uses rotating gears, and the longer
workers remain on the gears the more powerful actions they can perform. In
Calimala, players place discs between two actions on a grid, and can perform
both connected actions.
Manitoba has a tower of discs of different colors, and the active player
selects part of the stack which controls what map regions and tracks may be
used for actions.

94

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

In Keyforge: Call of the Archons, each turn a player picks what “house”
they will use, and only cards (actions) that belong to that house may be used.
Looking for novel ways to limit the actions that players can take is a constant
source of innovation in game design.
Warpgate gives players a hand of Action cards, each of which has two
possible Actions that can be performed. When playing a card, the player may
select which half to use. It has the additional twist that cards become more
powerful the later they are played in the round.

Variable Player Powers

Description
Each player has special Actions that only he or she can perform, or that
modify standard actions.

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanic that can modify Action and other systems, like
Resolution. We are placing it here, as it can typically give players additional
actions that they can perform or it modifies standard actions or procedures.
Typically, each player has a unique player power that sets them apart from
the other players. This is an excellent way to include asymmetry, as well as
emphasize theme, as in Dune, where the factions are highly differentiated
through different actions and abilities and are quite evocative of the source
material. For example, the Fremen faction, who reside on the planet, can
build units anywhere, and are better able to deal with the hazards on the
planet. The Guild faction, which controls all space travel, gains money each
time a non-Fremen player moves forces to the planet surface.
Variable Player Powers also improve replayability, as players will want to
return to the game to try out different factions and see how they play, and in
some cases this will feel like a completely different game.
These unique powers also increase complexity and cognitive load on the
players, however. In addition to the standard rules, the special exceptions for

96

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

each player need to be taught. The most successful of games where Player
Powers are at the forefront are based on very simple frameworks. Cosmic
Encounter is all about the player powers, and they can radically change the way
players play the game. The simple structure of Cosmic Encounter is an excellent
example. Combat is resolved by each player playing a number card, and adding
the number of tokens they have in the battle. Highest number wins. That
simple framework allows the designers to take the special powers in a dizzying
array of different directions. The designer has reserved most of the design space
in this mechanism for the interactions of the unique player powers.
Another feature of player powers is that they may make a particular
strategy optimal for that player. For example, a faction may be very good at
fighting, which will encourage a military strategy. This can be positive, as it
gives players an identity and immediate strategic direction for new players.
But it also limits players’ strategic choices, and they can feel as if there is one
“correct” way to play for a faction.
There are several options for conveying the details of a Variable Player
Power to the players. One is to state the rules explicitly through a player mat
or shield, as in Cosmic Encounter or Spirit Island, where they are all clearly
presented to the player at the start of the game through a player mat or limited
number of cards. Alternately, they can be spread out amongst a large number
of components, typically a deck of cards, such as in Sentinels of the Multiverse.
The advantage of the latter is that it makes it simpler to teach, as the base
rules are the same for all, and the differences only need to be taught when
they arise. It also gives the players a sense of discovery, as they see cards and
abilities they did not know existed.
On the negative side, this can make it difficult for new players to take full
advantage of a specific character, and so may lead to an unsatisfactory initial
play with a specific faction or character.

Once-Per-Game Abilities

Description
Players have a special ability that they can use one time per game.

Discussion
While there are exceptions, Once-Per-Game Abilities are usually different
for each player or character. Because they can only be performed once, the
designer has great latitude to make them very powerful.
These two characteristics combine to make this mechanism potentially be
player- or character-defining. The threat of using the ability, the decision of
when to actually use it, and identifying the correct moment can dominate
the play of the game as players maneuver for advantage, and can elevate
the strategy and tactics. It also adds another dimension of consideration
for players—timing—that is not present with always-on special abilities.
In Warmachine/Hordes, each side has one Warcaster who has an extremely
powerful single-use ability called a Feat. When and how to use the Feat is a
critical part of the game. As such, when characters have wildly varying special
abilities as in Warmachine/Hordes, it is important that players understand
exactly what their opponents are capable of doing. This rewards veteran

98

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

players and puts a burden on new players to understand the full extent of the
special Action.
Some games give players a set of special action tokens at the start of the
game, which are usable one time during the game. These may be the same for
each player, like Finca. Often, if tokens are not used, they give bonus Victory
Points to the player at the end of the game.

Advantage Token

Description
One player has a token that permits them to do a special Action, or modify
an Action. Once used, the token passes to another player.

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanism of Action Selection, as it determines what Actions
may be available to a player. Originally introduced in the 1981 game Storm
Over Arnhem as the “Tactical Advantage” token, it represents the ebb and
flow of a conflict. In Storm, the controlling player could use it to re-resolve
a combat, or to force a turn to continue when it would otherwise end. After
being used in this way, it is passed to the other player, who receives the same
options.
This introduces another consideration for the player, as the value of using
the Tactical Advantage must be weighed against its loss and the possible use
of it by the opponent. Similar to Once-Per-Game Actions (ACT-13), a timing
dimension is added to the decision-making. Normally, Variable Player Powers
(ACT-12) are always on, so if you can use them, you should. But that is not
the case with this mechanism.

100

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Twilight Struggle uses this mechanism more thematically than Storm Over
Arnhem, in the guise of The China Card, an actual card that is passed between
players when it is used. It is a powerful card that is even more powerful when
used to perform actions in Asia, but after use it is given to the opponent.
Again, consideration must be given to timing, and whether to use the card or
simply hold on to it and deny its use to the opponent.
Advantage Tokens can also be used to give ongoing benefits to the
owning player that do not require surrender. In Storm, for example, the
player controlling the token gets to go first in a turn, and decides the order of
resolution of conflict situations.
Many games use this system less overtly for tie-breaking. In a Sealed Bid
Auction for example (AUC-04), ties may be broken by a Priority Token.
Then, the token is given to the player who lost the tie-breaker. This is different
than the standard sense of this mechanism, as the transfer is not typically
controlled by the player. It simply designates who wins a tie, and its transfer
is never a choice. In another variant of this mechanism, the A Game of Thrones
board game features an Iron Throne token that is awarded to the winner of
the turn-order auction. The holder of the Throne determines how all noncombat ties among all players are to be decided. The recurring turn-order
auction is the means by which possession of the token moves around, rather
than by its use.
The Advantage Token mechanism gives the designer an opportunity to
give the players more control over certain random aspects of the game, such as
combat resolution in Storm Over Arnhem or card draw in Twilight Struggle. As
such, it can make a game feel more strategic, without a lot of rules overhead.

Gating and Unlocking

Description
At certain points in the game, different actions are made available to the
players. Actions may become available by a variety of means, including
reaching a certain turn or game stage. Depleting a shared pool or bringing
some track past a threshold level through the cumulative effects of the actions
of all the players is another common approach to triggering unlocks.

102

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanism of Action Selection, as it affects the availability of
Actions, rather than how they are selected. It may be used with any of the
Action Selection mechanism.
These new Actions can introduce new resources, give better or more
efficient options than the older spaces, and introduce completely new
mechanics. Agricola does all three of these. After each round, a new Action
card is added to the game board. Some of these introduce new resources, such
as Cattle or Boar, some give more of a resource per space, and others introduce
a completely new Action, such as Family Growth.
Adding more actions as the game progresses can be used by the designer to
control complexity. Early in the game, actions can be simple and limited, giving
the players a chance to understand the system without being overwhelmed. As
the game progresses, more complex actions and combos can be introduced.
Good candidates for this may be actions that are difficult or impossible to
perform early in the game anyway or are tactically improper. This helps give
players a positive first experience.
In addition to controlling complexity, adding actions also gives a sense of
forward momentum and narrative arc. New options are introduced to the
players, giving the game a progressively more advanced feel as it goes. Adding
spaces that give more resources, or allow earlier actions to be performed more
efficiently, adds a sense of acceleration.
The 18xx series of railroad games, such as 1830, has a strong gating system
that is a critical part of player strategy. Trains must be bought in order of
power. As certain train levels are exhausted, a variety of game effects are
triggered. Upgraded and more powerful track tiles become available, and
certain older trains disappear. Understanding and predicting the timing of
these transitions is a critical skill in 18xx games and is one of the reasons they
are unforgiving for new players, as these transitions accelerate as the game
progresses, so timing can be tricky.
Similarly, Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization has the players progress
through a variety of Age decks, with upgraded technologies, abilities, and
leaders. As each deck is exhausted, players need to discard cards from older
ages and reduce their population. Like 1830, the timing and anticipation
of these transitions becomes a skill for players to master. SpaceCorp also has
three Ages (called Eras), but the transition is more extreme as each is played
on a completely separate board, with only some advantages carrying over
from one to the next.

Description
During the course of the game, new Actions become available to specific
players, or existing Actions are improved.

Discussion
This is similar in many ways to the meta-mechanism of Gating and Unlocking
(ACT-15). New actions and abilities are introduced as the game progresses.
The differences in this mechanism are subtle but important. First, these
new and upgraded Actions are typically only available to a single player. It
is possible that multiple players can earn the same additional Action, but it
needs to happen individually.
Some games allow other players to take advantage of another’s personal
Actions, either by paying the owning player some fee, obtaining the ability

Actions

105

by force or trade, or by having the owner’s monopoly on them expire after a
number of turns, making them available to all.
These upgrades frequently do not make entirely new Actions available to a
player. Instead, they make specific Actions more efficient or powerful.
Whereas Gated upgrades typically are triggered on a timed or global
schedule (as in Agricola’s one new Action space per turn system), in a
Tech system players need to accumulate and spend some resource in
order to gain them. This can be a general currency, such as money, as in
Civilization, or a specialized “research” currency as in Eclipse or Through
the Ages: A Story of Civilization. There are games where techs are given
out freely, although these still have an opportunity cost as players must
forgo other choices.
Technologies do not have to be themed as research to use the mechanism.
In many games, hiring people, or building certain structures unlocks
new or advanced abilities. Puerto Rico is one of many examples of this.
Growing, evolving, building, and training are other common metaphors
for research.
Upgrades may have prerequisites that need to be satisfied, or may be easier
to obtain if you have an earlier tech. This results in a Tech Tree. For example,
in Stellar Conquest, if you have researched Industrial Technology, it is less
costly to then obtain Robotic Industry.
Tech Trees may also be expressed as Tracks. As players advance their
marker along one or more tracks, they may pass certain spaces, which gives
improved actions or abilities. Orleans and Russian Railroads both utilize
this mechanism. There may also be physical markers placed along these
tracks, so that the first player to reach those spaces gains those markers
and a special bonus. Other players will still receive bonuses printed on the
track.
Tech Trees may be disguised thematically. In Titan, players recruit creatures
into legions. The creatures that may be recruited into a legion depend on its
current composition. Three Ogres may recruit a Troll, and three Trolls may
recruit a Colossus. These creatures are more and more powerful, and some
have special abilities like flying.
This type of system gives the designer fine-grained control over
Actions available to players, and gives a path to offer different strategic
options, as players can choose which Actions and Abilities to invest in.
Having a limited number of these Techs also forces player interaction and
competition.

Events

Description
Actions occur outside the control of players that cause an immediate effect,
change the state of the game, or impact subsequent actions.

Discussion
Events can add variety and theme to a game. Many gamers’ first exposure
to events comes through Monopoly, in the form of Chance and Community
Chest cards. These may immediately affect one or more players. This type of
event is also found in Empire Builder, a railroad building game where cards
may cause derailments, or floods wipe out tracks crossing rivers.
However, their usefulness is multiplied by affecting the overall game
state for an extended period of time. Other events in Empire Builder may
cause blizzards, which affect train movement near mountains, or storms that
affect certain regions. This forces players to reevaluate their plans to try to
avoid or take advantage of the changed circumstances. Sometimes this can
be interesting for the players, but if it is too random and negative it can feel
punishing.
Events can also affect the global game state. In Evo, the overall temperature
is of critical importance to which dinosaurs will be able to survive. Each
turn, a die is rolled to determine how the temperature changes. The new
environment is in effect globally and affects all players. Similarly, in night
missions in earlier editions of Warhammer 40,000 dice are rolled each turn
to determine how far units can see.

108

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Core Worlds: Galactic Orders delays the implementation of Events. Each
round an Event is drawn, and all players can see what it is. However, it does not
go into effect until the end of the round. This gives all players an opportunity
to adjust to take advantage. Events in Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the
Cursed Island have an immediate effect and may further impact play unless
the players address them in some way over several turns.
Terra Mystica gives players broader visibility to an Event of a sort—random
scoring tiles. At the start of the game, tiles are placed that show what will
give bonus points for each round. Players can see what is coming up and plan
their strategy accordingly.
A delayed Event mechanism is used in Through the Ages: A Story of
Civilization. In this game, players play Event cards into a stack that may, for
example, give a bonus to the player with the strongest military. While the
player who added that card to the stack knows it will be drawn in the future,
the way that the events are played from stacks makes it very uncertain how
many turns it will be before it is drawn. While a player may have had the
strongest military when he or she played the event into the stack, he or she
may not by the time it is actually drawn.

Narrative Choice

Description
Multiple action options are presented to the players via a narrative format.

Discussion
With the rise of Dungeons & Dragons in the 1970s, game designers looked
for new ways to incorporate storytelling into game design. One of the earliest
to do this was the late-1970s Choose Your Own Adventure book series, which
began with The Cave of Time. In this series, at the end of short chapters, the
reader would be presented with a series of choices, which would lead to other
pages, and ultimately a good or bad conclusion.
This system has been adopted as part of more traditional tabletop games,
with an early example being Tales of the Arabian Nights. In this game, after
moving to a space, players are directed to read a numbered paragraph in
a large book to reveal what adventure the character is experiencing. These
vignettes offer choices of actions for the players, for example, “Bribe the
Guard” or “Fight Your Way In.” These lead to other numbered paragraphs,
which give the result, and their impact on the game state.
Frequently, these systems use Stat Checks (RES-02) to determine the
outcome. For example, if you choose to “Fight Your Way In,” you may need
to make a check against Strength or some other ability. Then, the paragraph
will tell you to proceed to different paragraphs depending on the outcome.
Sometimes, not all the actions will be available to you, unless you previously
found some item, or built up some stat to a sufficient level.

The strength of this mechanism is in the ability to bring more structured
narrative and flavor to the game, without the players needing to create
narrative from abstract game elements. However, the weakness of Narrative
Choice systems is that the adventures they present can be disconnected from
the main course of the game, and thus can lack context. Arabian Nights
ties the adventure to the player through the use of different environments
(sea, desert, etc.), and player status (married, despondent, cursed) that impact
the adventures. But the adventures themselves do not combine into a single
coherent narrative.
Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game attempts to deal with this contextual
issue by the Crossroads mechanism. The player to the right of the active
player draws a Crossroads card that applies to that turn. It begins with an
action trigger, such as entering a certain location, which is not revealed to
the phasing player. If the player takes the trigger action, the Crossroads
card holder interrupts the action, and presents the mini-adventure to the
player. This means that the game designer can write an adventure knowing,
for example, that it will specifically take place at a certain location. This
mechanism has two different implementations that are worth noting. In the
tabletop version, the Crossroads cards were written so that players were told
what the outcome of each choice would be prior to making the choice. In
the digital implementation, the outcome of each choice is hidden from the
players. This is another example of input vs. output randomness, but in the
context of making a meaningful narrative choice, hiding the mechanical,
in-game outcomes creates a more character-driven experience.
Games like Ambush! and Action Castle maintain narrative cohesion at the
expense of replayability. In these games, players are presented with specific
triggers or situations. For example, in Ambush!, moving into a specific space
during a certain stage of the mission will always trigger the same paragraph
to be read. Action Castle emulates computer adventure games, and has players
interact with the game via short phrases (like “take sword”), but the same
phrases will always work in the same situation.
Other games strive to maintain cohesion by locking narrative choices so
they only appear at specified times. In Near and Far, some of the narrative
passages are tied to the game’s campaign mode, to preserve a more cohesive
story. Risk Legacy uses a gating mechanism (see “ACT-15” in this chapter) to
ensure that specific story beats are only revealed once players have progressed
the campaign sufficiently to make the story fit.
Legacy of Dragonholt, a role-playing-style game (RPG), is built nearly
entirely on the Narrative Choice mechanism. A tracker sheet for both the

Actions

111

characters and the scenario allows for lots of stat-checking to determine
progress. Scenarios often come with a map of areas to visit. Each area, when
visited, will have different options open to the players based on a few factors.
If you come to a store at night, the store will be closed. If you go to market
on market day, there will be lots to explore. In addition to tracking time of
day and day of the week, players also track when they complete specific story
points, as instructed by the game book. These story points create a kind of
memory for the system, so options presented to players may depend on their
having marked a specific story point. If, for example, the innkeeper goes
missing, the game will instruct players to mark, say, story point B7. Later
options might direct players to read different texts if point B7 is marked,
to ensure that there is story continuity and that the innkeeper who went
missing isn’t behind the bar the next morning. Legacy of Dragonholt shares
more in common with pencil-and-paper interactive fiction books than with
traditional tabletop board games, but it is an excellent example of how flexible
the Narrative Choice mechanism can be.

Resolution

ӶӶ
In Chapter 3, we discussed Actions and the different ways that players can
choose or plan Actions. Sometimes, the outcome of an Action is specific and
definite. No chance is involved. For example, in Chess, if you take the Action
of moving your Knight forward, it will happen exactly as you plan.
However, some Actions have uncertain outcomes. Some are related to
performative uncertainty, as in a dexterity game, where you may not succeed
in performing your planned action. Others relate to chance interfering with
your plans, which we call Output Randomness (see Chapter 6). For example,
in Risk, you may declare an attack on Kamchatka (the Action), but the result
of that Action is not known when it is declared. You may win without losing
a single army, lose all your armies, or some result in between.
Because Output Randomness is most often associated with conflict, many
of the examples here are from war or battle games. However, there are plenty
of Actions that require some form of resolution, such as trying to sell at a
market, finding a hidden object, upgrading a technology, or approving a
budget in a political-economic game. This chapter discusses different ways of
determining the outcomes of Actions.

High Number

Description
Each player is represented by a numeric “strength,” and the higher strength
wins the conflict.

Discussion
This is a basic and common way of resolving conflicts. The base strength can
be represented by a fixed value for the piece, as in Magic: The Gathering, or by
the position on the board, as in Cosmic Encounter, where each defending token
adds 1 to the total defender strength. Sometimes, strengths may be determined
randomly. In War, players flip cards to compare strengths. Many games include
a “roll-off” mechanism, where each player rolls a die, and the high roll wins the
contest.
Frequently, base strength can be modified by some factor. In Magic: The
Gathering, there are a variety of cards that impact the Power and Toughness
of creatures (comparable to an Attack and Defense strength). In Cosmic
Encounter, each player secretly plays a number card which is added to the
number of tokens on their side, including allies.
Modifiers need to be carefully considered by the designer. Their inclusion
increases the complexity of the resolution, particularly if they come from
multiple sources. For example, a game may grant the defenders a +2 modifier
because they are defending in the mountains, and a −1 modifier because they
are infantry defending against artillery. While the math seems simple, having
a long list of modifiers for the players to apply can be burdensome. It is better
to have these factored into intrinsic strengths, or through card play or dice
pools whose outcomes model the probabilities desired.
The dungeon-crawler Descent: Journeys in the Dark uses a High Number
mechanism combined with a Dice Pool. The characters, weapons, and
situation add or remove dice from the attacker’s and defender’s pools. They

Resolution

115

then each roll their dice, and count hits (for the attacker) or shields (for the
defender). The higher number prevails. If the hits exceed the shields, the
defender takes damage based on the difference.
This attrition-style mechanism, where damage is caused based on the delta
between the final strengths, is common. A less common alternative is Winner
Takes All, where the losing side is completely eliminated at no cost to the
winner. The game 4000 AD implements this mechanism, which can lead to
tension and wide swings, as a 10-strength fleet will completely eliminate both
a 1- and 9-strength fleet at no loss to itself. The lack of realism can impact
theme and immersion.
An Ordered High Number system is used in the Risk series of games. In
these games, Attacker and Defender typically roll multiple dice. The highest
roll of the Attacker is compared to the highest of the Defender, second-highest
Attacker roll to second-highest Defender roll, etc. Because of the simultaneous
ordering of the rolls from highest to lowest, this system has lower variance
than just making N independent rolls. It also offers a much simpler way to
give an advantage to the player with greater numbers without resorting to
modifiers. If a player has a 3:1 numerical advantage, they simply roll three
dice versus the opponent’s one, which is much simpler than gaining modifiers
to the die roll.
An interesting twist on this system is to switch whether the high or low
number is the winner within the same game. For example, in Battleball, a
simulation of futuristic football, players are represented by different size dice—
six-sided, eight-sided, twelve-sided, or twenty-sided. When moving, rolling
higher is better. High rolls allow a player to move farther. The D20 wide
receivers are great at dashing down the field. The D6 linesmen are much less
mobile. But when trying to tackle, both players roll their die against each other,
but now the low number wins. So, linesmen will usually tackle wide receivers.
However, this system leaves open the possibility for surprises in both running
and tackling.
In numeric comparison systems, some means to deal with ties needs to
be included. In combat simulations, these ties typically are awarded to the
defender; however, any tie-breaking mechanism can be used.
High Number and Stat Check mechanisms can be combined for a more
nuanced mechanism. See the Stat Check section for more details.

Stat Check

Description
There is a target number required to succeed at some test. A random number
is generated (by card draw, die roll, etc.), which is compared to the target. If
it meets or exceeds the target, the action succeeds.

Discussion
This mechanism goes by a variety of names, including Task Check, Skill
Check, and others. It is commonly used in role-playing games (RPGs), such
as Dungeons & Dragons, where a player makes a roll against a stat or target
number. Typically, if it is lower than the target, the action succeeds.
Stat Check is frequently used in battle games, like Axis & Allies, where
each type of unit has a target number that it is trying to meet or exceed to
score a hit. Warhammer uses a similar system with six-sided dice, and rates
units as, for example, 2+, 3+, or 4+, if it needs to roll a 2 or higher, 3 or
higher, or 4 or higher. The group of minis (or single mini) is then rated for
how many dice it gets to roll. One attack may be rolling 8 dice for a 4+, and
another might be 5 dice for a 3+. Target numbers may be modified based
on characteristics of the defender, such as terrain, or special armor, but the
