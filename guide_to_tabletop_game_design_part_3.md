An exercise that I like to do when play testing a game is to record all the players’ results—­their
score, the number of cards they have in play, their remaining health, etc. If those numbers are
close to each other—­for example, if Brenda has 13 points, Evelyn has 15 points, and Jack has 16
points—­then I’m satisfied with the balance of the game. But if the scores are way off—­Brenda
has 5 points, Evelyn has 15 points, and Jack has 35 points—­then I know the balance is off, and
I start looking at what factors contributed toward creating such a large gap in the final scores.
Another number that can be changed is the actual amount of something being used in the
game—­not limited to just components. For example, what if we feel that our game plays too
fast? We could increase the number of squares on the track. This would require us to redraw
the track, but it might be worth it if we get the desired play results. Or perhaps we feel that
rolling a 1 on the die makes the player’s movement too slow,6 so we could put a sticker over
the 1 spot on the die and change it to a 7. That would speed things up!
Statistically, this can happen several times in a row. I once had this happen to a player during a play test and they
said, “I hated this game because I only ever got to move one space!”

Speaking of dice, let’s talk about the next way to change our game: by changing a
component.

Change a Component
Let’s change a component for our game right now. Instead of using a coin, which gives only
two results, let’s change to using a six-­sided die. If you already own a board game, go ahead
and take a die from it. So now, on the player’s turn, they roll the die and move that many
spaces. Notice how this already speeds things!
This reminds me of a saying that I have.
“Your goal as a designer is to get the player to play your game the way that you want it to be played.”
Me (again)

It’s important for us, as game designers, to know what kind of experience we want the player
to have. The great video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto7 says, “When I create a game, I try
to focus more on the emotions that the player experiences during the gameplay.” Let’s write
down an emotion that we want the player to experience when playing your game:
The emotion I want the player to experience is: __________
There are lots of emotions that you could write down: wonder, joy, fear, tension, sadness,
curiosity, anger. . .but there’s one emotion that I prefer not to go after when designing a
game, and that’s fun.
The Problem with Fun
The word fun is hard for a designer to capture, especially when starting to design a game. Oh,
you can start with an idea that you think might be fun or start with a proven gameplay that is
you know is fun. But fun itself is elusive and, even worse, subjective.
Fun is like funny—­there are some things that people think are funny and make them laugh
while other things fall flat. But sometimes it’s hard to say what is funny or not. It depends on
many different things that you, as a designer, could not know about. I find that if you chase
something as nontangible as fun, you end up frustrated and discouraged with your design.
This is why I prefer to go after “unfun.” We all know when something is “unfun”—­whether
it’s rolling straight 1s on a die or moving your pawn verrrrrry slowly up the track. It’s easier
to change “unfun” back into “fun” by changing or removing it.

Shigeru Miyamoto (1952–present) is a video game designer and director for Nintendo of Japan. He is the creator
of Mario, Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda, and many more famous and successful games.

Fun is really another name for what we
experience when we are being properly
challenged and engaged by a game.
Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
(“Me-­high Cheek-­sent-­me-­high”) introduced this idea in his theory of flow. You
know when you’re doing something and
you lose all track of time? That’s when
you are in the “flow state”—­you are so
engaged in what you are doing that everything else seems to fade away.
Flow is gauged by two vectors: skill and challenge. If the player is able to keep between these
vectors, they will remain in a flow state. However, if a game is too hard or too boring, then
they will fall out of flow and get discouraged or even quit playing.
It is the game designer’s job to set up challenges for the player that are appropriate to their
skill level. This is when we can engage the player and create an atmosphere—­the magic
circle—­where it’s okay for challenge and fun to occur.
Back to Our Board Game
If we want to make even more changes to our game to make it more interesting or challenging, we can combine our first two methods—­change a number and change a component—­by
changing the number of components. Tricky, right? Go ahead and add a second die to your game.

CHAPTER 1

L e t ’ s M ak e a B oa r d G am e !

Now, when the player rolls both dice on their turn, their results would be from 2 to 12. A
12 would really zoom the player along the track! But that might be too far for the player to
travel on one turn, and we don’t want our game to be over that quickly.

Change a Rule
Instead, we could change the rules. We could let the player roll two dice and then choose
which result they wanted to use. That way, if they rolled a 1 and a 5, they of course would use
the 5 because it would move them further along the track. Just changing the rules about how
the components are used makes our game more interesting.
What are some other rules we could change about our game? For this, we are going to need
to get some colored pencils, pens, or crayons. Go ahead and color each space a different color
such as blue, yellow, green, and red.
Now, let’s add rules to go with those colors.
■■

■■

■■

■■

When you land on a blue space, you roll the dice again, pick one, and move that
many spaces.
When you land on a yellow space, you can move another player’s pawn either forward
or back to the space you are on.
When you land on a green space, you roll the dice and immediately move the result of
both dice. (For example, if you roll a 2 and a 3, you move five spaces!)
When you land on a red space, you lose a turn.

Now that we’ve added these new components and rules, let’s revise the rules of our game!
My First Game’s Rules (Version 2.0)
1. All players put their pawns on the START square.
2. The youngest player goes first.
3. Roll two dice. The player gets to pick one of the two results and move up the track that
many spaces.
4. If the player lands on a colored space, the following happens:
a. When you land on a blue space, you roll the dice again, pick one, and move that
many spaces.
b. When you land on a yellow space, you can move another player’s pawn either
forward or back to the space you are on.
c. When you land on a green space, you roll the dice and get to move the result of
both dice. (For example, if you roll a 2 and a 3, you move five spaces!)
d. When you land on a red space, you lose a turn.
5. After each player’s turn, pass the dice clockwise around the table.
6. The player whose pawn reaches the FINISH space first wins the game!

Go ahead and play this version of the game. See how different it is than the previous one?
Just with the addition of a few new rules, we have something brand new.

Change the Theme: An Introduction
to Theme and Genre
The last way to change our game is to change the theme. Theme refers to the type of game
that it is. Actually, that’s only half-­true. First let’s talk about another word that often gets
used in place of theme, and that’s genre.
The dictionary definition of genre is “a category of artistic, musical, or literary composition
characterized by a particular style, form, or content.”8 But, in tabletop game design, there are
two types of genres—­one that refers to the content and the other that refers to gameplay.
The first type, story genre, pertains to the authored theme of the game. There are many,
many story genres (and subgenres!). I like to think of them as how the books are organized in
a bookstore; books are classified by the type of story: mystery, horror, science-­fiction, fantasy, romance, finance, biography, etc.9
One of my favorite things about board games is that they can be of any genre! Really! All
story genres that you can think of can be a board game. Here is a list of games and their
story genres:
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

Clue (mystery)
Arkham Horror (horror)
Twilight Imperium (science-­fiction)
HeroQuest (fantasy)
Fog of Love (romance)
Monopoly (finance)
Einstein: His Amazing Life and Incomparable Science (biography)

I hope this short list proves that any story genre can be turned into a board game!
But there is a second type of genre, and that is the game genre, which refers to game’s type
of designed gameplay. Just like story genres, there are many of these, all of which we will be
talking about in more detail later in this book.

Definition from www.merriam-­webster.com/dictionary/genre.
My book Level Up! The Guide to Great Video Game Design has a great big list of story genres in it because there are so
many story genres that sometimes I forget some of them!

Taking our previous list, here are the game’s game genres:

Clue (deduction)
Arkham Horror (coop area control)
Twilight Imperium (4X)
HeroQuest (dungeon crawler)
Fog of Love (card hand management)
Monopoly (roll and move)
Einstein: His Amazing Life and Incomparable Science (polyomino tile placement)

It is common to refer to a game by both the story genre and the gameplay genre. For example, my board game Rayguns and Rocketships is a pulp sci-­fi action/skirmish game. “Pulp sci-­fi”
describes the story genre, while “action/skirmish” describes the game genre.
But let’s concentrate on the game we are making. The game genre of the game we are making
is known as a “roll and move,” but what is the theme (story genre) of our game?
The theme of my game is: ___________________________________
If you couldn’t come up with an answer, that’s okay because this was a trick question.
Our game has a genre, but it doesn’t have a theme. . .yet. Currently the genre of our game is
known as an abstract game. We’ll talk more about abstract games and other genres of
games in the rest of the book. But for now, we want to come up with a theme for our game
because themes do many things to help our game.

One of the things a theme can do is to help the players understand the rules. If, in my game,
I have two ways to travel—­by foot or by airplane—­then it makes sense that moving by airplane will be faster than moving on foot.

If my game is about pirates, it makes sense for the goal of the game to be the pirate with the
most gold. It also makes sense for each of the players to be able to steal gold from each other
because that’s what pirates do!
There are so many ways to inform a player of the theme—­art, text, rules, gameplay—­but
let’s concentrate for a moment on the art of our game. You don’t need to be a great artist to
communicate theme. Here are just a few ways we can easily give our game some theme:
■■
■■

■■
■■

Color the path blue to indicate that it is a river and we are boats traveling up it.
Draw a castle on the FINISH tile to indicate that we are traveling in a medieval
kingdom.
Draw a ghost on the red tile where the player has to lose a turn.
Draw stars all around the path to set it in outer space.

CHAPTER 1

L e t ’ s M ak e a B oa r d G am e !

You can also change the text on the game and in the rules to give our game more theme. Here
are some examples:
■■

■■

■■

■■

If a player lands on a red square (where there is a ghost), they are too scared to keep
moving and lose a turn.
If the player lands on a green tile, they have gotten a ride from a friendly frog who hops
them forward the number result from rolling both dice.
If a player lands on the yellow space, a witch curses another player, and they must be
moved backward to the closest player.
If a player lands on a blue space, you continue your journey through the kingdom.

Just using some theming to describe what happens to the player in the game makes the
game come alive!
Let’s try this again. No tricks this time:
The theme of my game is: ___________________________________
Rewrite your rules and update the art on your board to match your new theming. Go ahead
and play this new version with your friends and family.

A game consists of rules, gameplay, and a victory condition.
Rules are the actions, conditions, and guidelines that the players must all agree
to perform and follow to play the game.
Gameplay is the interaction between the player and the game and its components. Gameplay is the activity of playing the game.
A victory condition is the goal or the group of goals that the player needs to
achieve to win the game.
Change one thing, and you change the entire game experience. Things we can
change include the following:
■■ A number
■■ A component
■■ A rule
■■ An objective
■■ The theme

Wr i t i ng R ule B o ok s I s Hard
IN A PERFECT WORLD, every board game would come with a game designer.
Can you imagine it? You buy a new board game, take off the shrink-­wrap, admire the cover,
open the box lid, and ZOOOOOP! Out pops the game designer like the Genie from Aladdin1
who then teaches you the game! Wouldn’t that be great?

Unfortunately, as most game boxes2 are too small to hold a game designer inside, we game
designers must rely on a rule book instead.
Why create the rules first?
Because without rules, you don’t have a game. Games are not emergent; they are designed. Rules
create the structure of the game. Without it, you just have a loose collection of components.
Remember, a game is composed of rules, gameplay, and a victory condition. The rules are the
structure on which the components and interactions and everything else in a game hang. The
first thing you learn when you play a game is how to play it by reading the rules.
Rules are the most important thing about making a game; therefore, a game designer should
strive to master writing clear and concise (and maybe entertaining) rules. You must also realize that the rules pertain to everything about the game, so if you don’t get the rules right,
then it affects everything else about playing the game.
However, writing a rule book is hard (especially writing clear, concise, and maybe entertaining rules).
Why is writing rule books so hard? Because it carries most of the burden of the game. You cannot
have a game without rules. The rules must also be clear and concise (and even entertaining);
otherwise, your players will get confused, frustrated, or even lose interest in playing your game.
You never want that to happen; thus, the main job of a game designer is to be able to communicate the rules in a way that the players can easily follow.
If you read the user forums of BoardGameGeek.com (BGG), you’ll find that they are filled
with gamers complaining about rule books. Sometimes these complaints are justifiable, but
other times they are not. These users will complain that a game’s rules are “broken” or “poorly
written” or just “bad.” When a person reads that a game’s rules are not good, they are far less
likely to buy the game.
Why is writing rule books so hard? Because they must engage and entertain from the very first
moment a player starts to read them. Game designer Rob Daviau (Pandemic Legacy [2015],
Return to Dark Tower [2022]) says that the best moment for the player’s engagement is opening the box, and the worst moment is reading the rule book.
As a game designer, you must make your rule books step on the gas rather than bring the
game experience to a screeching halt.

The Problem with Rule Books
Why is writing rule books hard? There are several problems with rule books, some of which are
inherent in their very nature. Let’s look at four problems and possible solutions.

Problem #1: There Can Be Only One (Reader)
Because there is only one rule book in the box means that only one person can read it at a
time. The rest of the players can’t do anything but listen. This can be a bigger issue, especially
if the person reading isn’t a very dynamic reader. The droning of rules can bore or even turn
a player off from wanting to play!
My favorite moment is when one person reads something from the rules and another player
doesn’t think that they’ve read it right so they take the rule book (sometimes without asking) to read it for themselves. It’s as if they don’t believe the person who just read it! This rule
book tug-­of-­war can get tiresome, especially if it happens before gameplay even begins!
Solution: If you are like me and prefer your board gaming to be an analog experience, consider including player overview cards that the other players can review to “follow along” the
major beats of the game and understand objectives and the types of actions they can choose
from. Alternatively, video rules can also help with clarifying rules.3
There are some great video rules available, but often they are created “after the fact” by secondary sources. Video rules add just another step to the complication of creating a game for
the game designer. Not only must you be good at making a game, but you also must be an
effective communicator and a decent videographer! I didn’t sign up for all this work!
However, in today’s media-­centric market, videos are becoming more and more of a necessity. I know some publishers who won’t accept a game submission without a “how-­to-­
play” video!
This means you must be ready to make a video for your game even if it is never seen by your
customers. You don’t need a fancy camera or editing to make a decent video (at least,
not yet!).
Here are a few things to keep in mind when creating a how-­to-­play video for your game:
■■

Keep it short. No matter how complicated your game is, keep your video to 3 minutes
or shorter. Sadly, most people just don’t have the patience to watch anything longer.

If you want to experience board game video rules at its ridiculously over-­produced extreme, check out the super-­
cheesy 35-­
minute “how to play” video of DragonStrike (1992) available at www.youtube.com/watch?
v=FF1_IHliRhI.

■■

Set up your game on an uncluttered surface. . .or use a digital prototyping tool like
Tabletop Simulator. Show all the components and how they interact during the game.
Your video viewers want to know what the game pieces do and how they interact with
each other. It also helps to show how the game is supposed to look when set up properly and how things interact during play.
Have good sound. Poor sound quality is the most common problem I see with many
game videos. Speak clearly. A good trick is to smile when speaking, which makes
your words sound clearer and friendlier. Try not to mumble. Write down your
instructions as a script and read it if you must. Rerecord if you make a mistake or
trip over a line.
Be enthusiastic and positive. Your game is great! Let others know this too! Never
mention the problems with your game or make excuses for anything about it. It’s
okay to mention that the game is a work in progress or the art is placeholder; publishers understand this. Also, don’t insult other games to make yours appear to
be better.

Don’t forget to mention the name of your game and who you are. You can watch one of my
own how-­to-­play videos at www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5sJrh5TVA.

Problem #2: Front-­End Information Overload
Have you ever experienced a player who reads the entire rule book to the other players before
they can start playing? Some rule books are very long. I remember having another player
read the rules for about an hour before we started playing!

CHAPTER 2

W riti n g R u l e B oo k s I s H ard

I understand the need to read the entire rule book. Players want to make sure that they (and
the other players) understand everything about the game. They don’t want to play the game
incorrectly.4 However, the human brain can sustain only so much of this information-­
pummeling before it is beaten into submission and causes you to feel like giving up even
before you’ve started playing the game!
Solution: There is a process from cognitive psychology called chunking in which information is grouped into a collection of basic units, usually around a common subject. Once
you’ve learned a “chunk” of information—­like a set of rules or sequence of player’s actions—­
you should then introduce the next “chunk” of information to the player.5
Some board game designers have been experimenting with chunking rules into more “bite-­
sized” bits as part of the play experience. These “learn-­as-­you-­play” rule sets can be found in
titles such as Charterstone (2017), Stuffed Fables (2018), Friedmann Friese’s Fast Forward
system (used in games such as Fear (2017), Fortress (2017), Flee (2017), Fortune (2018), The
Princess Bride Adventure Book Game (2020), and Story Time Chess (2021). They are worth
checking out for ideas and inspiration.

Problem #3: Rule Book Length
Large rule books can be intimidating to
a player. I have seen some players decide
against playing a game merely because
they are intimidated by the rule book’s
length. Some players feel that it would
be a better use of time to play the game
than spend time reading the rules. That’s
not to say you can’t or shouldn’t have a
longer rule book if your game requires it,
but you want to be aware that the longer
your rule book, the larger the barrier you
are placing between the player starting
to play your game.

Here’s the truth: at least 50 percent of the time, you will play a game incorrectly the first time. I once played a game
four times before I felt like I was playing it correctly!
5
In the 1950s, psychologist George A. Miller discovered how many things the human mind can process at once. In
his paper “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,” Miller proved that humans can really hold only five to
nine things (words or numbers) in our head at once and anything past that causes information overload. This is why
American phone numbers have nine digits—­to help people remember them.

25

26

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Solution: Writing succinctly is an art and a skill. Often a designer wants to describe a mechanism or gameplay function in length. Or they might want to include lore, tell a story, or
write the rules in “a voice,” as if a character were telling the reader the rules. However, all of
these tend to take up space in a rule book. If you can’t edit yourself, get an editor to help you
reduce page count.
I’ve found that a great way to keep track of page count is to set a page number limit.
Because of the limitations of printing, rule books are usually a minimum of four pages.
Pages are generally added in groups of four, so make sure your page count is a factor of
four (4, 8, 12, 16, etc.). This limitation helps you decide what to keep and what to cut.
Another factor to keep in mind is the physical size of your rule book. A rule book that is
5 inches by 7 inches is going to require more pages to cover the same content that is found in
an 8 by 11 inch rule book. Consider the “reading experience” you want your players to have
and how you are going to present the information (via text, via illustrations, via examples) to
help determine the size of your rule book.
The physical box size will also determine the size of your rule book. If your box is 5 inches by
7 inches, then you can’t have a rule book larger than that.
Finally, not all games require rule books. Some games are simple and require only a single
two-­sided sheet of rules. There’s nothing wrong with being “short ’n’ sweet,” as long as all the
information the player needs to understand how to play your game is covered. The rules to
my game Pantone the Game (2018) are a single sheet because that’s all we needed to
explain the game.

Problem #4: Edge Cases
Rule books cannot cover every situation or answer every question; otherwise, you will have a
very long rule book. When edge cases—­problems or questions that aren’t addressed in the
rule book—­arise, they can frustrate players if a quick or readily available answer can’t be
found in the rule book.
Solution: It helps to have a frequently asked questions (FAQs) section in your rule
book. These questions can be discovered by rigorously play testing your game. The more
often that your game is play tested, the more often these edge case questions will come up.
It’s then up to you to decide to squash the edge cases in the rules or to allow for them by
making exceptions. We’ll be talking more about play testing soon.
If you keep these problems (and their solutions) in mind as you begin to write your rule
book, the more successful your rule book will be.

Tricks to Writing Rule Books
As I’ve said, writing rules is hard. Fortunately, I’ve picked up a few tricks when it comes to
writing rule books that I’m happy to share with you!
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

Trick #1: Rules are stories.
Trick #2: Use the six zones of play.
Trick #3: I am talking to “you.”
Trick #4: Use present tense.
Trick #5: Include pictures.
Trick #6: Add callouts.

Trick #1: Rules Are Stories
The best written rule books are like stories. They have a beginning, a middle, and an ending.
As a thousand bedtime stories and movies have taught us, every story starts from the
perspective of the protagonist, the lead character of the story. “Once upon a time, there
was a poor girl named Cinderella. . .” or “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, there was a
farm boy named Luke. . .”; you get it.
In the case of board games, the protagonist is the player. Yes, you can have more than one
protagonist in your story. When you start explaining your rules, you do it from the perspective of the player.
I find that if you start your story by focusing on who the player is and what they are doing, it
makes it much easier than starting with more complicated or abstract concepts such as objectives, components, or mechanisms. Use the rule book to tell a story. Hmmm. I think an
example would work well here. . .what is the story of Chess?

Once upon a time, there were two kingdoms who fought a war. The war ended when one of
the kings was captured.
Both players—­protagonists—­are kingdoms engaged in a war. The goal of the game is to capture the opponent’s king—­the opponent. Players do that by moving pieces around the board
(battlefield) until one is in position to capture the king.
Notice what I just described:
Who am I? A kingdom.
What am I doing? Fighting a war.
How do I win? Capture the king.
Beginning, middle and ending. It’s the basic structure of a story, but it’s also the basic rules
of playing Chess. Ask yourself, what is the story of your game?

Trick #2: Use The Six Zones of Play
Trick #2 takes a bit longer to explain, so bear with me. We’ve already established that rules
should be written from the perspective of the player.
It is also important to think about where the players are positioned at the game table.
When you describe the actions of the game, it helps to work your way from the player outward toward the center of the table and the other players when describing how the components are to be used to complete victory objectives in the game.
To describe this concept, I use a theory that I call the Six Zones of Play. I first noticed this
theory when I observed how players who sit near a certain spot at the game table will tend to
primarily focus on that section of the game and the game board regardless of whether there
are better options elsewhere.
For example, while playing Charterstone, I observed that even though players could make
a play at any available location on the board, they tended to play nearer their “home” location (within arm’s reach) regardless of how good any other optional move was. Some of
the players were even hesitant to get up from their chairs to observe what the offerings
were at the other side of the table, even if there was a better move to be made by
playing there.

This same phenomenon occurred during a game of Formula D (2008). Players who were new
to the game remained seated until it became clear that they would need to get up and move
around the table to move their cars. (In some cases, the player asked another player to move
their car for them!)
After witnessing this, I started thinking about the relationship of the player to the table, the
player to the components of the game, the components to the table, the direction of the
components on the table, and even the relationship of the player to their own hands and
how they affected the play of the game.
Not long after, I was playing a prototype in which an important victory condition was on
a sideboard. As a result of my unfamiliarity with the game as well as the distance of the sideboard from where I was sitting, I neglected to interact with the sideboard. As a result, I
lost the game handily, mainly due to missing scoring opportunities on the sideboard. I identified the issue to the designer, but they didn’t have a better solution to my concern. That got
me thinking: what could be done to help the player pay more attention to the entire game,
rather than just the bit in front of them?
The more I thought about it, the more I realized I was on to something interesting. So,
I did what I always do; I drew a picture to help me get my thoughts in order.

The theory is that there are six zones of player activity that physically compete for a player’s
attention during gameplay. These zones are based on the physical interaction and ergonomics of the player. I find that the proximity of the zones to the player impacts certain aspects
of play as well as emphasizes their importance to the player during gameplay.
There is a natural priority to these activities due to their proximity to the player. The zones
are as follows:
Zone 1: The player’s dominant hand
Zone 2: The player’s nondominant hand
Zone 3: The tableau
Zone 4: The board/shared space
Zone 5: The sideboard
Zone 6: The rule book

CHAPTER 2

W riti n g R u l e B oo k s I s H ard

Zone 1: The Player ’s Dominant Hand
The first zone is where the player holds cards or information that is most important to the
play of the game. It is the most secret and personal of spaces and, in most cases, not accessible to the other players unless a card or ability allows it. From a functionality point of view,
the player might often swap out what is in this hand to perform some other action, such as
move a unit, roll a die, or make some other significant move during the game, but players will
hold these components “close to their chest” as it were. They are often critical to the player’s
success of the game and the best zone to which the designer can convey or even change information to the player.
Zone 2: The Player ’s Nondominant Hand
The second zone is the domain of the hand that is doing what the other hand isn’t. Depending
on the player’s handedness (left, right, or ambidextrous), the nondominant hand might be
reaching for resources, moving a pawn, or even grabbing snacks. Often a player will switch
between these two hands to perform different tasks, only to return to the dominant hand.
The nondominant hand is an accessory to the player’s dominant hand when it comes to functions, and the designer should never make the functions in the nondominant hand redundant to those in the dominant hand. (For example, a player should never have to juggle two
hands of cards at the same time.)
Zone 3: The Tableau
The third zone is the personal play space of the player. It’s where a deck of card goes, and it’s
where the player keeps their character sheet, their pile of meeples, coins or resources, or a
status tracker for health or some other currency. The other players rarely have access to this
space, unless a card or special ability allows it. It is where many of the player’s tactics are
plotted out.
As a designer, this is the second-­best location to convey information to the player as it is literally “in front of the player” and hard to ignore. Plus, this zone often undergoes the most
change during a game, allowing a location for new status or rules to be communicated to
the player.
Zone 4: The Board/Shared Space
The fourth zone is the first and most important common space in the game. All players have
access to this place where they can move and place their pawns/meeples, collect resources
and cards, or interact and combat the other players. This is usually where you find resources
and currency used in the game. This zone often represents the microcosm of the game—­a
representation of the game’s world and everything that isn’t of personal use to the player.
Information and rule changes can be done here, but because of the distance of the board to

31

32

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

the player, it is less desirable. Any change to any game state represented on this board should
be big, obvious, and clear to all players.
Zone 5: The Sideboard
The sideboard zone is the domain of extensions to the main game board (zone 4) and is often
where secondary mechanisms for the gameplay resides (such as the corruption tracker in
Lords of Waterdeep: The Scoundrels of Skullport (2013). In many cases, these side boards are
used to track time, points, or world conditions such as a round.
Because of their distance from many of the players at the table, components in this zone
should be designed to have a lesser priority or be infrequently used (such as once every player
has had their turn or when a specific condition arises) by the players. This zone is where
problems can arise for players. One suggestion is to make this zone mobile so that it can be
moved to the other player rather than being locked into a fixed and distant location.
Zone 6: The Rule Book
The sixth zone is also troublesome to game designers. When a player needs to refer to a rule
book during the game, it breaks the game’s magic circle and the immersion of the game.
Designers should strive to make players refer to a rule book as infrequently as possible. This
of course is the greatest challenge to a game designer—­clear and concise rules.
NOTE

In addition to the rule book, the Internet also counts as zone 6 for the purpose of the Six Zones
of Play theory.

Player aids (which can live in zone 3), rules printed on cards (zone 1), icons on the game board
(zone 4), or even a shorthand guide printed on the back of the rule book (zone 6) exist to keep
the players from having to “go into” the rule book, distracting them from gameplay. There are
some games (such as SeaFall (2016) or Betrayal Legacy (2018) that have separate storybooks that
contain narrative elements that keep the players within the magic circle of the game. But in general, having to go back to the rule book disrupts the rhythm of play. As a game designer, you
should strive to reduce the need to go to the rule book and focus on keeping players in the game.
Zone 0: The Mind
The Six Zones of Play theory primarily focuses on components and their spatial relationship
to the player, but game designer Mike Sellers reminded me that the mind of the gamer is just
as important, as it is holding all the strategies and tactics and information vital to the playing
of the game. While I agree it is of course important to always consider the player and what
information they should know (or need to know) to play the game, their mind doesn’t come
with the game nor does it always remain in the same location during play; therefore, it
doesn’t quite fit in with the Six Zones of Play theory.

CHAPTER 2

W riti n g R u l e B oo k s I s H ard

However, a designer does need to take account of the amount of information the player
needs to hold in their mind (remember chunking?). As the designer, you can help the
player by providing components to capture that information such as scratch sheets or
player guides.
Zone X: The Box
There is one other zone outside of the Six Zones of Play, zone X. This zone is the game’s
box. It’s the phantom zone where pieces are banished for bad behavior, if they aren’t necessary to play this version of the game, or extra components that aren’t needed for play.
Sending components to the box means that they are completely out of play and should never
be considered during gameplay again. Out of sight, out of mind, as they say.
Of course, some games use the box for gameplay, such as Cleopatra and the Society of Architects
(2006), The Architects of the Coliseum (2016), or Backgammon (1635)—­a game that doesn’t
have “architect” in its title. I know some players who store the face-­down Scrabble (1948) tiles
in the box top rather than use the draw bag like civilized people. This allows the players to
pass the box lid around like a portable sideboard. This just goes to show that there are always
exceptions to every rule or crackpot theory about game design.

The Goal of the Zones
What is the point of identifying these zones? As a designer, the goal, is to bring activity from
the further zones (4–6) into the closer zones (1–3) so that any necessary information can
remain in the player’s view and be easily accessed. Remember, all gameplay should be centered around the player, and the closer you can keep a game’s components and information
within reach of the player, the more engaged they will remain in the game.
To bring everything back to writing rules, your rules should describe to the player how to
play the game by “moving” from one zone to the next. This “chunking” of information will
help the player understand how components are meant to be used and what their relationship is to each other in the context of the entire game.
Okay, back to the tricks!

Trick #3: I Am Talking to “You”
For many years, rule books would refer to “the player” or “he” when describing rules. Then
game designers realized that women played games too, and you could find rule books that
addressed the player as “she.” Hooray! Progress.
Try to use gender-­neutral language whenever possible. We really don’t know who is playing
our game, so I always find it better to refer to the reader of the rule book as “you.” Rather
than a rule book describing how “the player” does this or “the player does that,” it’s “you” do
this, and “you” do that. “You” is more personal. It’s friendlier. It’s more direct. It cuts to the
chase. It describes the action better. It’s more inclusive.
That said, if you need to be clear about who exactly is doing what when, try using the term
active player to indicate that the rule is directed toward that player and not whoever is
reading the rules.

Trick #4: Use Command Statements
This is an old writing trick that I find works especially well for rule books. For example, say
“Roll dice” instead of “Dice are rolled,” and say “Move your pawn” instead of “Players will
move their pawn.” This keeps your instructions sounding fresh and exciting as you read them
(especially aloud) rather than stagnant.

Trick #5: Include Pictures
They say one picture is worth a thousand words. It may be trite, but it is true. But in the case
of a rule book, one good illustration that shows the players how gameplay works is priceless.
You could spend pages of a rule book describing how gameplay works, but if you show the

CHAPTER 2

W riti n g R u l e B oo k s I s H ard

player one good illustration (or two or three) detailing that gameplay in action, they will
understand it much faster and clearer than any words can convey. It is too easy for someone
to confuse words, no matter how simply you state something, while a clear image is almost
impossible to misinterpret.
Players tend to read rule books only once or twice and will return to the rule book only when
they’ve forgotten a rule. Help them find those rules quickly with the help of an image or even
color-­coding sections of the rule book to help them with quick navigation.

Trick #6: Add Callouts
Speaking of aiding your rule book readers with quick navigation, another good trick is to use
“sidebars” or “callouts” in your rule book. These can be images or rules that relate to a specific
action or situation in your rule book. For example, in the rule book to Splendor (2014), there
are two different callouts that show (1) how buying cards can score points and (2) how more
valuable noble cards score and affect other cards.

What makes a callout unique is the ease in which the player can find it in the rule book.
Callouts are best used either with common actions or with edge case situations. What’s
­useful about callouts is that they are easier/quicker for a reader to find in the rule book,
­especially if they have an associated image or subject header to aid the player.

35

36

You can also use callouts to tell your story, display character bios, or display flavor text. But
keep in mind, callouts should be used sparingly for just the most important situations.

What Every Good Rule Book Needs
Now that you have some simple tricks to keep in mind when writing your rule book, let’s talk
about writing it! The good news is that there is an established structure that you can follow.
Sure, some rule books might not follow this exact structure and you are free to play around
with the format, but an outline is always a great place to start.
My favorite outline comes from my friends at Pegasus-­Spiel,6 who have created a list of what
they believe every good rule book should contain.

Creating an Introduction
The introduction, also called the overview, informs the player of the “who, what, and
why” about your game. If you are a creative writer, this is a great place to introduce the story
and set the mood. Just like with a book or a movie or a song, you need a strong introduction
to grab the player’s attention if you want them to go along with you for the ride! For example,
here’s the introduction to the highly thematic game Camp Grizzly (2013):
It’s 1979 and the Counselors at Camp Grizzly are enjoying Jody’s guitar by the campfire. Chet left to
check the generator an hour ago. He should have been back by now. . . Then HE appeared—­the man in
the bear mask. With a subtle nod, he tossed Chet’s severed head into the campfire before splitting Becky
in half. Who, if anyone, will survive the night in Camp Grizzly?

Creepy! As you can see, the introduction is a great place to introduce the lore of the game
with your player, but be careful not to make this too long; I find that a little lore goes a long
way! How long is too long? A few paragraphs are fine, but anything past a page is too long.

Or if you want your rule book to be narrated by a “character,” the introduction is the best
place to establish the “voice” of your rule book. Again, be aware that the more “character” you
write, the longer it will take players to read through the rules. I find there’s a fine balance
between writing personality and efficient rules. Use this technique with caution.
The overview can also be used to summarize how to play the game. This is what we did in the
rules for my game Pantone the Game:
In Pantone™: The Game, you’ll use colors to create representations of Characters from pop culture and
beyond. The colors are inspired by Pantone™, the world’s leading color expert. When you are the Artist,
you’ll choose one of your Character Cards and then design a representation of that Character using only
color swatches. Arrange your Swatch Cards in a way that will make it easy for other players to identify
the Character. When someone guesses your creation, you both score points! Play occurs over three
phases, each one more challenging for the Artist. Once everyone has been the Artist three times, the
player with the highest score wins!

No matter whether you use it for storytelling or simply as a rules overview, just make sure
that you keep your overview brief, energetic, and interesting!

List of Components
The list of components is a list of all the parts that are needed to play the game. Why
would you want to include this in your rule book? Players will want to know if all the pieces
required to play the game have been included in the game so if anything is missing, they can
contact the publisher to get a replacement.
The list of components serves another useful purpose—­it lets the publisher estimate how
much the game will cost. This is particularly important when selling your game—­a topic
that, you guessed it, will be covered later in this book.
Take a photo or create an illustration of all the game’s components so players can see what
everything looks like. It also helps to show pieces in relation to each other so players will
know if a component is big or small.
You don’t need to show every bit and piece in the game, just a representative image of the
component. It always helps to give a little bit more information than you think might be
necessary. For example, it is helpful to show both the back and the front of a deck of cards as
part of the component list.
The list of components teaches players the names of the different types of components. This
is important especially when components have a similar appearance. For example, knowing
the difference between the encounter deck and the item deck will be important during

37

38

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

g­ ameplay. You want to make sure that everything is clearly labeled. You should try to give
components a distinct name (even to the point of giving them a name each with a different
letter of the alphabet). Make sure everything on your component list has a name. For example,
I recently read a rule book where the miniatures used in the game were shown (great) but
none of them was clearly labeled with a name. The players wouldn’t know which miniature
was which character (bad).
As you are giving components names, you’ll find there is a temptation to give your components a thematic name. I’ve seen coins called nibs, shards, and suns; but do you know what is
a perfectly good name for a coin? A coin.
Don’t get too clever with naming your components. Resist the temptation to give components bizarre, strange, or unpronounceable names. As my friend and game designer Andy
Ashcraft says, “If something has a perfectly good name, then you should use it.”

Game Setup
The game setup is an illustration or photo showing how the game is meant to be set up on
the table for the start of the game. The setup shows the player where all the components are
meant to go and how components are meant to be divided among the players.
The game setup also creates context for the components you just showed them in the component’s list. If any components need to be combined or prepared in a specific way, you should
call it out in your illustration—­for example, if a deck of cards needs to be shuffled ahead of
time or placed in a particular order. The game setup illustration should show how the game
will be set up for as many players as possible, although many rule books show either a two-­or
four-­player game.

The Goal of the Game
What’s the goal? The goal of the game describes how to win the game. “Wait a second,” you
say, “if a game is a story, then why would you want to spoil the ending at the beginning of the
rule book?”
That’s a good question. I’m so glad you picked up on it! It’s because you need to give the players context as they read through the rest of the rule book. I can only know all the different
ways to win a game if I know what the game’s victory condition is ahead of time.
As an example, if you read the rules to 7 Wonders (2010), you will learn that you can gain big
