altering the game too much: hence go (stones), golf (points), and horse racing (weight)
all handicap fairly well. Chess, on the other hand, does not: taking a piece away from
someone really changes the character of the game. But speed chess is fine: just give
the two players different amounts of time.
With computer games for two or more players, it is often not that hard to put in
some sort of handicap system, perhaps a tax of some kind on the stronger player, or
making all the weaker player’s units 10 percent stronger. Such systems are not all that
widely used, though. Perhaps that is because most handicap systems need more than
a mechanism for altering player strength in-game: they also need a rating system and
a correlation between rating and handicap (indeed players often rate themselves by
the handicap they need—again look at golf or go). When two players meet, if they
can instantly understand what handicap would give an even game, they are much
more likely to use the handicap. Such systems do not generally exist with computer
games, and worse yet, many games are one-shot affairs with no follow-up, so there is
26. DKPs, or “dragon kill points,” are MMO guild point systems to determine which guild
members gain valuable in-game items based on the previous participation records of those
members (how many “dragons they’ve killed”). DKP systems vary widely and are created and
managed by each guild rather than built into the MMOs themselves.

no chance to institute a handicap in a second game (let alone adjust it in a third).
Besides, the larger pool of people online means it is easier to look for someone else to
play rather than tweaking a handicap with a given opponent.
Computer games for one player, though, do typically come with a handicap system,
namely difficulty adjustment. Here the player usually chooses for herself what the
right handicap is, making a more systematic structure involving exact ratings less
necessary. Dynamic difficulty adjustment is also an option in computer games. This
may turn out to be fine if the player never realizes what’s going on, but has the potential to lessen the sense of achievement one might feel if it is revealed.

Characteristic: Misbehavior

Game players engage in a wide variety of behaviors that may be viewed negatively by
other players. We divide those behaviors into three broad categories: cheating, sharp
play, and griefing.
Cheating
Games have rules, and rules restrict players. It is easier to win without those restrictions, so sometimes players cheat: they disobey the rules. One might think there is
not that much more to say about cheating, but it turns out cheating is a surprisingly
rich metagame area. How hard it is to cheat, how effective cheating is, and what costs
(both in-game and out-of-game, both formal penalties and informal ones) are associated with cheating all vary widely. Perhaps surprisingly, even the acceptability of
cheating varies widely, to the point where certain violations of the rules are not even
considered cheating.
Cheating is hardest in turn-based games with no hidden information. As long as
your opponent is paying attention, it is hard even to imagine how you could violate
the rules of chess unnoticed. If the game contains random elements or hidden information, cheating becomes more practical because it is less detectable, although it is
not always easy—manipulating dice or cards often requires some skill. If the game

232

Chapter 7

Figure 7.9

takes place in real time, that often helps enable cheating as well, since the pace of the
game gives less chance for opponents to detect it.
In informal games, penalties for cheating are usually not precisely defined. They
range widely, though, from eye rolling and a demand that the game revert to its precheat state, to outrage and loss of friendship (or even risk of physical harm, if money
is on the line). In more formal situations such as tournaments and refereed games,
there are usually very explicit penalties for various violations of the rules. When the
game has more at stake, the penalties for cheating tend to go up, and all the more so
if money is involved.27
Usually violations of the rules are met with social disapproval on the part of most
of the player community. Sometimes, however, they are not, and occasionally the
violations are so widely accepted that they are not considered “cheating” at all. For
example, being offsides in football is against the rules, but not many people would
call it cheating. Factors that push a violation into the “not cheating” category include:
the violation is relatively easy to catch, there are referees available to penalize it, an
27. See Friedman’s Law’s Order (especially chap. 15) for an interesting discussion about some of
the relationships between the severity of penalties, the chance of getting caught, and any costs
or benefits to committing the offense.

Superstructure

233

appropriately severe penalty is applied, the violation is not a deliberate attempt to
injure someone, and the violation is possible to commit by accident. All of these
factors mean that people’s sense of fairness is less likely to be upset, and the rule violation may be seen more as a reasonable strategic choice or an unfortunate accident
rather than cheating. Another example of a violation that might not be considered
cheating is using your hands on the ball in soccer (when you are not the goalie) in a
desperate attempt to stop the other team from scoring. Taking steroids, on the other
hand, is more widely viewed as cheating. Although it does have severe and established
penalties, it is hard to detect, it involves injury (although mainly to the perpetrator),
and it is hard to do by accident.
Note that small and moderate rule violations tend to be punished in-game (foul
shots, sitting out for two minutes). More severe violations involve penalties that go
beyond one game (being banned for several games, or even for several years). Violations with more severe penalties are more likely to be viewed as “cheating,” although
it is arguable which way the causation runs.
One normally thinks that the less cheating possible in a game, the better, and in
general this is surely true. Certainly large amounts of cheating are unsustainable:
noncheating players don’t want to be at a constant disadvantage, so they will leave
the game, and the cheaters are looking for an advantage over the majority, so they
will ultimately be dissatisfied as well. However, some of the most exciting metagames
have a moderate amount of cheating, at least of the “perceived as okay” rule violations
discussed above. Much excitement in sports comes from the tension and drama (often
involving heroes and villains) of rule violations and the resultant penalties. Pro wrestling (which might be thought of as spectation for a game with no actual game underlying it) has elevated this to an art form. Note that having this tension correct in a
metagame all but requires refereeing of some kind, so that the cheaters (or rule violators, if one prefers not to think of it as “cheating”) can be caught and punished, at
least a fair amount of the time.
With computer games, cheating takes on different forms. Since generally speaking
the computer is the referee, cheating is often impossible for an average player, but for
a player sophisticated enough to modify the game code,28 cheating can take place that
may be difficult to detect. Sometimes so-called cheats are built into the game code for
single-player games, but given that these are part of the shipped game, using them is
probably closer to using an alternate game mode or alternate difficulty setting rather
than actual cheating. For online games, the owner of the game code can serve as a
kind of referee, but often cheating becomes ill-defined—in addition to modifying the
28. Or any player, if they download a modification someone else has written. But in either case,
serious preparation is required.

234

Chapter 7

game code, any behavior the game owner dislikes (see the discussion of exploits in
the section on “Sharp Play” below) might be labeled cheating.
A few more examples:
Card games (bridge, say) Simple forms of cheating, such as not following suit, are
easily detectable by good players. More sophisticated cheating, such as altering shuffles
and deals, or illegal signals during bidding, can be hard to detect but is also hard
to do.
• Battleship Cheating is very easy in Battleship, and all but impossible to detect if
done carefully. With such temptation, people who might not otherwise cheat will do
so, and the game can break down as a workable enterprise.
• Baseball Baseball has a rich history of cheating: steroids, corked bats, pine tar,
spitballs, and of course the Black Sox.
• Starcraft
The cheat of choice is the “map hack” (an add-on program that reveals
the parts of the map normally hidden by fog of war), which shows the dangers of
trusting the game client. Because the client knows the full game state, there is no way
to be certain the player is not using that knowledge to reveal hidden information.
•

This last example, of the map hack in Starcraft, brings up an interesting point: the
perception of cheating may be more damaging than the cheating itself. It is possible
for cheating to be relatively rare, but perceived as much more widespread. A good
Starcraft player, with a strong intuition for what his opponent is likely to do and where
(or simply with a strong tendency to build observers29), will often be accused of map
hacking even if he is completely honest. Both accuser and accused are likely to feel
their game experience has been tainted, and too much of this sort of thing and many
players will quit. This is why it is so important to stamp out cheating in multiplayer
online games: not so much because of its direct effects, but because of the discouragement it causes among honest players, who feel either that they are falling behind or
that they must work harder than the cheaters to achieve the same results.
Sharp Play
Sometimes certain in-game practices are acknowledged as being within the rules, but
still somehow “disreputable”—as taking advantage somehow. In older books about
games, these practices were often described as “sharp.” A classic example from poker
is sandbagging—that is, opening with a check when you have a strong hand. Nothing
in the rules forbids it, and many players now would consider it simply a possible way
to play with no moral connotations at all, but in the past many people considered it
slightly shady.
29. One player of the authors’ acquaintance referred to observers as the “broken unit” because
he felt the ability to secretly see his opponent’s activities was so powerful and game-changing.
He was very frequently accused of map hacking.

Superstructure

235

Other examples of play that some playgroups will find disreputable:
Rule lawyering: using the rules of complex games to one’s advantage, perhaps by
bringing up certain little-known rules only when it helps one’s position.
• Rushing in an RTS: some casual RTS players feel rushing (attacking very early in the
game) is unfair, or not fun, and expect it not to occur in “casual” games (typically
meaning the game they are playing in). Sometimes this policy will be announced with
a statement like “20 minute no rush,” but sometimes it will merely be assumed,
leading to bad feelings if other players don’t share the assumption.
• Playing an especially powerful strategy in a casual environment: more generally,
playing very aggressively or using very powerful gameplay techniques can be seen as
unsportsmanlike. A typical example is bringing a tournament-quality Magic deck to a
more casual play environment, but even just being a much better player (say at oneon-one basketball), or bringing a “ringer” to a team game, can evoke a similar
reaction.
• Simply trying too hard to win
• Counting cards in blackjack30
• Some political behaviors, especially kingmaking
•

As mentioned above, in sports with explicit penalties for certain rule violations, violating those rules (and paying the penalty) is often not perceived as “cheating.” However,
doing so deliberately (because the benefit gained in some particular instance is perceived by the violator as being greater than the penalty) is often seen as sharp play,
especially in casual games.
Computer games, where essentially the game code is the rules (i.e., the things the
code lets you do are ipso facto what you are allowed to do), have the concept of
“exploits”: things you are capable of doing within the game, but that you are “not
supposed to do.” MMOs are especially prone to this problem. Sometimes it is quite
clear that a certain game action is leading to results the programmers did not intend
(clicking five particular buttons in a particular order to make a million gold pieces
land in your lap), but sometimes it is not clear at all (finding a path that avoids several
dangerous monsters but still reaches some valuable loot). Since players are always
trying to find clever ways to do better at the game, it is a real burden on them if some
of these ways—and how can they know which ones?—are deemed “too clever.”
Removing the possibility of the behavior in a patch is one thing, but branding the
players as cheaters and punishing them is quite another. After all, one person’s exploit
is another person’s clever play.
30. Sometimes card counting is officially against the rules, but it is certainly awkward to have a
rule against a player strategy. The situation is quite similar to the concept of “exploits” discussed
below. For one account of this interplay between casino and gambler, see Kushner’s Jonny Magic
and the Cardshark Kids.

236

Chapter 7

So what counts as sharp play is highly agential. Some playgroups (typically more
serious or “hardcore” ones) will accept a given practice; other groups (typically more
casual ones) will feel the practice is unfair or inappropriate and will disapprove of it.
An interesting example that highlights this difference is the practice of taking back
moves. In very serious groups, it is usually considered cheating (although it may not
be mentioned specifically in the written rules), in fairly serious groups it might be
allowed occasionally but frowned on, and in very casual groups not allowing your
opponent to take back a move might be considered “sharp”: technically a player may
forbid her opponent to take back his move, but doing so is the mark of an unpleasant
player, one who is “too serious.”
If sharp play is seen as “taking advantage,” what is it taking advantage of? One view
might be that it is taking advantage of holes in the rules, weaknesses that prevent the
specific and exact written rules from fully reflecting the “spirit of the game.” Since the
spirit of the game will seem different to different players, what violates it and what
does not will seem different as well. Looked at this way, it is further evidence that “the
rules are not the game.” And it brings out again the parallel to law brought up by the
phrase “rule lawyering”: a common objection to law is that laws are supposed to represent just outcomes, but too often an outcome is in accordance with the law but still
unjust. Similarly, players may see certain behaviors as in accordance with a game’s rules
but against that game’s spirit. Since it is impossible to get complete agreement on what
a game’s spirit (or societal justice) is—insofar as it is possible, those agreements tend
to be encoded in the rules (or laws) already—some disagreement is inevitable.
Griefing
Sometimes players engage in gameplay behavior that does not benefit their own position in the game, but instead merely makes another player miserable. In online games,
especially when done out of pure vindictiveness, such behavior is referred to as “griefing.”31 Although meanness has always existed, in games as in life generally, the anonymity of online gaming has made griefing much more common (and, in particular,
common enough to receive a name).
In a way, griefing can be thought of as kingmaking’s evil twin: it is political in the
sense that it is gameplay behavior not intended to help the perpetrator win. It’s done
to make someone else lose rather than to make someone else win.
Common forms of griefing include repeated dominance of a weaker player (a lowerlevel player in an MMO, or a much weaker player in a high school football game) and
refusal to concede (see the discussion of “hide the farm” in section 2.1 on player
elimination).
31. One of the authors claims the definitive book on the psychology of Internet gamers was
presciently written by Joseph Conrad over 100 years ago—Heart of Darkness.

Superstructure

237

Note that griefing, although an in-game problem, often requires metagame solutions. It is hard to prevent griefing purely from in-game mechanics, because there are
just too many things a creative player can do to annoy others. In offline games, griefing is typically controlled by other players refusing to play with the griefer, or applying
out-of-game repercussions, from social shunning to even (in extreme cases) physical
violence. Current online systems make it hard to avoid griefers or to shun them in
out-of-game contexts, but examples like eBay’s reputation system or Facebook’s friend
networks show that it is possible in principle. Even in practice, griefing can be controlled where the same group of people play together regularly. For example, MMO
guilds effectively limit griefing within the guild itself—someone who frequently
griefed his guildmates would simply be ejected from the guild. It is imaginable that a
more general reputation system, properly fed into online player matchmaking, could
help control griefing further. As players start to have more consistent online identities,
and thus reputations to protect, perhaps online griefing may become not that much
more common than offline griefing.
Restrictions on Misbehavior
It is easy for game designers to get upset about misbehavior: they have a vision of
how they think the game should be played, and player behavior can disrupt that
vision.
The important question, though, is whether the behavior is actually making the
game less enjoyable for most players. In that sense, adjusting a game to stop misbehavior is like fixing game balance: the important point is not whether some element
in the game is working differently than how it was foreseen (some amount of that is
inevitable in any complex game), but whether the element is creating a bad experience. Moral outrage is unlikely to be useful—in the case of sharp play, it may be
misplaced, and in the case of griefing or cheating, the perpetrators are unlikely to pay
attention.
If the game system allows too much bad behavior, the fault is with the game design
and not with the players. Part of game design is understanding what incentives the
game system presents to players, and understanding how the players are likely to react
to those incentives. Players will try to push the game system as much as they can to
win (whatever “winning” means to them), which is only to be expected, and demanding that players “play the game as intended” is unlikely to yield good results.
So the approach most likely to be effective is to adjust the game’s incentives—
ideally before the game is released, but sometimes afterward. Proper rule enforcement,
perhaps done automatically (for an electronic game) or by judges (for a paper game
or sports), is key so that players who want to follow the rules don’t feel driven out by
the success of those who do not. In MMOs, restricting PvP by zones, consent flags,
and no-PvP servers are all examples of systems that restrict play automatically. Deck

238

Chapter 7

registration rules in Magic tournaments or rules about touching a piece in chess require
human enforcement, but similarly serve to limit behavior that most players would
rather not see become widespread.
In small groups of people that play together regularly, behavior rules can be made
up on the spot and enforced by social pressure. With larger and more anonymous
communities, such as online games, sports leagues, or boardgame tournaments, the
temptations to misbehave and the lack of social enforcement mean formal structures
are needed—hence the existence of special rules for tournaments and leagues that are
not part of the rules of the game itself. Some of these rules are needed strictly for the
running of the tournament (e.g., rules about how players are paired), but some are
extensions of the game rules (e.g., explicit penalties for various violations of the game
rules) needed because of the misbehavior-prone anonymous environment.

Characteristic: Play Lifetime

Some games are bought, played for a few hours, and then set aside and never revisited.
Others are played for months, years, or even a player’s entire life. A great many factors
go into the lifetime of play a game can have—every characteristic we’ve discussed can
affect it. Perhaps a player set the game aside because he felt it had unsatisfying heuristics; perhaps the rewards were not worth the effort. Another player might have kept
playing for years because she enjoyed the amount (large or small) of randomness in
the game, or because she found the metagame compelling.
For digital games, being technologically up to date can make the difference. Asteroids is not as popular now as it was when it was cutting-edge arcade technology. Many
older digital games have all but vanished today. Some of the best ones, though,
survive, whether on emulators, on carefully preserved old hardware, as ports to new
platforms (the web games and handhelds of today often make good platforms for the

Superstructure

239

Figure 7.10

console games of yesteryear), or in new versions (sometimes these sequels capture the
magic of the original and sometimes they don’t).
Beyond these issues of overall game quality and (for digital games) of technology,
there is the question of the game’s content—how easy is it to exhaust the possibilities
the game has to offer? Can the player eventually explore everything interesting in the
game, or is there always something new to discover? Tic-tac-toe and chess are in some
ways similar games structurally—two-player turn-based games with no overt luck—but
one has at most an hour or two’s worth of play for an adult, and the other has more
than a lifetime’s. Myst may be very enjoyable the first time through, but once a player
reaches the end, she may not want to play again, since she now knows how to solve
all the puzzles. A Final Fantasy game offers more than Myst on a second playthrough,
but enough of the pleasure is in the story that many people might decide not to play
again. A game like Starcraft, though, can be played again and again, and indeed it has
continued to be played long past its expected technological lifespan.
A long play lifetime is perhaps better thought of as a goal that a game may or
may not have, rather than as a “defect” of the games that lack it. Play lifetime varies
based on the type of game. Classic games and sports tend to have long lifetimes,
arguably because ones that do not are unlikely to reach classic status. Classic games

240

Chapter 7

with short play lifetimes are often meant for children, for example tic-tac-toe and
war, but there are exceptions such as sliding-block puzzles and the like.32 Online
subscription games and digital object sales games need long play lifetimes to support
their business models. Digital games that rely on boxed sales do not—if a player buys
the game, plays it through, feels it was a good value, and never plays again, the
game can still be successful. However, a game that people can keep playing is often
perceived as a good value, and a boxed-sale game can succeed by giving long-term
play value. For example, Diablo II is a boxed-sale game but has an enormous amount
of repeat play value: new character classes to play; nightmare, hell, and hardcore
difficulty modes; an enormous item-chasing subgame; and online play. It has sold
well for ten years after its launch, despite being technologically far behind more
current games.
Game Content, Exhaustible and Otherwise
Why does someone quit playing a game? If you ask them, they will often say it’s
because something else intervened: perhaps another game that came out, or perhaps
some real-life event. But there are always interruptions of one kind or another, so it
is worth looking at the game in question to see if there is anything that made it easier
to put down, or less likely to be picked up again afterward. In multiplayer games by
far the most common answer is “because my friends stopped playing it” or “I can’t
find anyone to play with anymore.” This is of course a second-order effect—somebody
had to stop playing it first.
There are two basic reasons to stop playing a game: you’re bored with it, or you’ve
finished it. In the first case, there may be a weakness (or just a bad fit with your tastes)
in one or more characteristics—unsatisfying heuristics, or reaching a very flat part of
the reward-for-effort curve, for example. In the second case, the game must be of the
sort that can be “finished.” Such games are especially common in the digital arena,
and are rare among sports or classic boardgames and card games: one doesn’t say of
soccer or chess that “I’ve finished the game”!
A game has two basic strategies to hold a player’s interest. It can provide content
for the player to consume, content that, after being experienced by the player, may
not have further appeal—exhaustible content. Or it can attempt to provide intrinsic
variability: play patterns that differ from play session to play session without a game
designer having to create new material. Most often, intrinsic variability comes from
other players (for digital games, possibly including AI opponents): soccer and chess
32. However, if one thinks of the sliding-block puzzle genre as a game type, like crossword
puzzles, and the individual puzzles as new “layouts” within that game type, like a card solitaire
layout or a specific crossword puzzle, then sliding-block puzzles as a whole are far from
exhaustible.

Superstructure

241

remain interesting in large part due to the constant and yet ever-changing pressures
that opponents bring to the game.
Although exhaustible content is more common now than it used to be, it is by no
means a new phenomenon. A crossword puzzle33 is exhaustible content: having done
it once, a person is unlikely to want to do it again. As with any game built on exhaustible content, to keep a person interested in crosswords, puzzle creators must keep
making new puzzles.
If a game relies on content, there are a number of ways to extend that content’s
reach. Sometimes content can be created randomly: the random layouts of card solitaire, the random minefields of Minesweeper, and the random dungeons of NetHack
and Diablo are examples. Other times the content can be reused by means of various
game modes. A single-player RPG with multiple character classes gives one way to
reuse game content; multiple difficulty levels are another. If the game allows extensive
customization, players may replay it several times, customizing it differently each
time. While all these things take some effort to create, they can be very efficient ways
of extending content, because they serve as content multipliers rather than merely
adding to the existing content.
One game feature that pushes against replay is having an explicit ending. Some
games, like Tetris, most arcade games, or chess, don’t have an explicit end. Puzzle
games do: they end when you’ve solved the puzzle. Computer role-playing games
usually do: single-player ones have an ending point when you finish the story, and
massively multiplayer ones have a level cap. Often RPGs have ways to keep playing
past the end: replay using a new character class, replay to find hidden areas or complete some in-game collection, replay on a higher difficulty, or continue playing an
MMO through PvP or raiding (and the equipment-collection game associated with
them).34 Even if there are options for continued play, though, many players will take
the “end” as a natural time to stop.
In general, it is the games with an explicit end that are built on exhaustible content,
and the games without an explicit end that are built on intrinsic variety. (For a counterexample, think of a paper role-playing game, where there may be no specific end,
and the game carries forward based on the gamemaster creating a continued stream
of content.)
33. Note that here the “What is a game?” question rears its head again. People don’t normally
call crossword puzzles “games” or say that you “play a crossword.” But the issues surrounding
crossword puzzles and exhaustion of content aren’t really all that different from, say, those surrounding Myst. And as stated in the introduction, we see no benefit in saying that either crossword puzzles or Myst (or both, or neither) is “not really a game.”
34. The very concept of “replayability” subtly assumes an ending. One does not “replay” soccer
or chess; one simply plays them. To “replay” a game typically means it had an end the first time
one played it.

Chapter 7

How Goals Drive Play Forward
Games, and their associated metagames, have goals that give players reasons to keep
playing. Nowadays these goals are often formalized in explicit achievement systems,
such as those found in Xbox Live Arcade or in World of Warcraft—or in the certificates,
ribbons, and trophies found in children’s sports. However, games have always had
goals, the most basic one being simply to win a given game. Achieving a certain level
of skill—being able to run a marathon in under four hours, or mastering the CaroKann opening in chess—is another common goal that players set for themselves.
Defeating a particular opponent, say beating grandpa at checkers, is another.
Goals in a game may be primarily linear: defeat a succession of harder and harder
opponents, beat the game on an increasing series of difficulty levels, or complete a
series of story quests in order. They may also be nonlinear (i.e., independent of one
another): win a battle using only marines, complete a task without resorting to
combat, or find the hidden flower.
Goals are very appealing (indeed, every game has them in some form) as game
elements because they keep players interested until the goal is reached. But goals,
especially powerful overarching ones like “finish the storyline” or “reach the level
cap,” also provide stopping points for players. Chess doesn’t have a big overarching
goal, so it doesn’t get the benefits that such a goal can provide. On the other hand,
it doesn’t have a point where a player thinks “now I’m done” either.
Goals have evolved a great deal in computer games. Originally, there may have
been no goal other than finishing the game, if it was the type that could be finished,
or perhaps a high-score list was provided—especially common for arcade games, where
“finishing” was undesirable for business reasons. Nowadays, there are explicit achievement systems, campaign frameworks (e.g., a global battle map framing a game centered on small tactical battles), and RPG frameworks (e.g., world exploration, leveling
up, and collecting equipment for a game centered on snowboard racing). There are
still high-score lists, or leaderboards, but often there are many of them for many different categories. As mentioned above, if there is a single overarching goal, such as
completing a story or reaching a level cap, there are often postcompletion goals such
as PvP. All these things provide additional goals for players. One danger, however, is
that as online play (or offline play with online performance comparisons) becomes
more common, many of these goals, if they involve comparison with other players,
seem unachievable to the vast majority of players. It’s one thing to get the high score
on Pac-Man at the local arcade, where you’re competing against dozens or hundreds
of local players; it’s much, much, harder even to make the top ten on a leaderboard
that shows everyone on the Internet. Comparison against smaller pools (everyone in
your guild, everyone on your server, everyone in your friends network) can make
achieving these goals seem possible again.

Goal Chunking
Players’ progress is often tracked by very fine scales: ratings (e.g., the Elo system) and
scores (computer game scores, golf scores, race times, etc.). Such tracking is very good
for comparing player performance, whether it be comparing one player with another,
or comparing a single player’s performance today with her performance last week.
These comparisons are especially useful for races—it is often how you tell who has
won—and for single-player games, where it supports a multiplayer metagame based
on score comparison.
On the minus side, though, it is often hard for players to care about fine distinctions in points. So it can be useful to “chunk” fine scales into coarser ones. For
example, Dance Dance Revolution gives players not only a point score, but also a letter
grade. Many players do not care about their exact point score but do care if they
have managed to get an A or a B on a particular song. When games do not do this
explicitly, players will often do it for themselves by setting cutoff points: perhaps
they will strive to get over one billion points in a certain pinball game, or to run a
marathon in under four hours. In direct head-to-head games, chunking is less relevant
(or if you like it comes built in): beating the other player is a clear and satisfying goal.
Even in chess, though, when you consider the single-player metagame of improving
your rating, there are chunks: one can be a master, an international master, or a
grandmaster.
While chunking goals can make them more compelling, completion of such chunks
does give a game “stopping points.” Having chunked goals in a game may simply
result in players playing until bored, and then continuing to play until the next chunk
is finished, only quitting after that. Still, some kind of grouping of fine-scaled goals
is probably a net benefit, especially for a single-player game.
Play Lifetime and Number of Players
Very often (although there are many exceptions) single-player games tend to be
content-oriented games, and have the issues surrounding completable goals, explicit
endings, exhaustion of content, and so on. In other words, single-player games are
most prone to being “finished.” Multiplayer games are more likely to be based on
intrinsic variability, in large part through the medium of the other players.
Thus formal goal systems (achievements, collections to complete, different game
modes, and the like) are especially useful in single-player games. Players need goals,
and without other players to provide them, it’s up to the game itself to do so.
In a game with two or more players, the other players provide the goal: win against
them. This goal always renews itself, and if a player’s skills increase and he wants a
more difficult challenge, the goal comes naturally in more difficult versions: win
against more difficult opponents.

Chapter 7

With single-player games, simply winning may not be the best goal for long-term
play. That’s because (even without issues of content exhaustion) once a player has
won once, future victories may be too easy. After a few wins, a player needs new goals,
such as winning on Very Hard, getting the “Blasted Lands” achievement, or collecting
every Pokémon in the game. Typically the game designer needs to add these goals
directly, unlike games for two or more players, where to a great extent the opponent
does the work.
One can see enormous evolution here. For example, look at arcade games. Thirty
years ago, a typical Asteroids player’s goal might be simply to get the highest score he
could. Today, a Dance Dance Revolution player has not only score, but chunked goals
(the letter grades) and subgoals (each song is a goal in and of itself), all of which come
in various player-selected difficulty levels. Players will continue to set goals for themselves, or choose them based on the competitive and social influences of other players,
but they now have a lot more material to work with.

Von Neumann Game Theory

I. Brief Overview
Two different subjects go under the name of “game theory.” One is the theory due to
John von Neumann and John Nash, which at its core focuses on simple abstract games
like rock-paper-scissors, where two people make a single move simultaneously. The
other, combinatorial game theory, is more recent and deals with games like chess
where two players take turns until one player loses. This appendix covers the former
and appendix B covers the latter. Our tone is fairly informal—each of these theories
is a big subject in its own right, and we can’t do much more than give a taste. References are provided at the end of these two appendixes for those who want to learn
more.
The first, and better known, theory is almost always called simply “game theory,”
but one might call it “von Neumann game theory” if one needed to distinguish it.
The theory is largely due to John von Neumann and John Nash and dates back to the
1940s. Economists like to use this kind of game theory for economic modeling, so
much of the current work comes from them and other more application-oriented
types, such as policy analysts and biologists.
The typical game that this theory is good for is a two-player game where each player
moves simultaneously just once, and then the moves are compared and each player
gets a payoff. This whole setup is usually encoded with a “payoff matrix” (examples
follow shortly). Rock-paper-scissors is a classic example, but most of the games in Von
Neumann game theory are made-up examples constructed to illustrate the core of
some more complex situation. Such games are more objects to analyze than games
one would play for fun.
The big idea is to look for “equilibrium points”: strategies that are, in some sense,
the ones that players “should” play if they are trying to avoid losing (which, oddly
enough, turns out to be not quite the same as trying to win). The big result of

246

Chapter 8

the theory is a theorem saying that these equilibrium points, suitably understood,
always exist.
II. The Basic Setup
The simplest way to present a von Neumann–style game is to write the game in grid
form, with Player 1’s strategies along the left and Player 2’s along the top. Each box
in the grid shows the payoff in the form x, y, where x is Player 1’s payoff and y is
Player 2’s payoff.
Example 1: Rock-Paper-Scissors

Here if Player 1 plays rock, and Player 2 pays paper, the payoff of –1, 1 means Player
1 loses $1 (or a victory point, or whatever you imagine the players are playing for)
and Player 2 wins $1.
In general, one makes some assumptions about any game one analyzes:
1. Each player is trying to maximize his or her own payoff (they don’t care either way
about the other player’s payoff1).
2. Each player is smart and knows that the other player is as well (each will play the
best strategy she can, and will expect the same from the opposing player).
As an aside, rock-paper-scissors is zero-sum (what one player gains, the other loses) and
symmetric (each player has the same options as the other). These two properties can
be important for some results in the overall theory, but won’t concern us in our brief
overview.
1. Not caring about the opponent’s payoff seems like a big restriction. But it fact it’s more of a
convenience than an actual restriction. For example, if we say the players are trying to maximize
their payoff minus half of their opponent’s (each player wants to get ahead, and cares a little
about keeping the other player down as well), we can just tweak the payoff numbers to reflect
that. So, for this example, a payoff of 6, 2 would become a payoff of 5, –1. The new game that
results is exactly the same as the original game, but now each player cares only about his or her
own payoffs—the amount that they cared about the other player’s payoffs has been encoded in
their own.

Rock-paper-scissors relationships come up frequently in games of all sorts. For
example, in Warcraft III melee units beat ranged units, ranged units beat air units, and
air units beat melee units.
Example 1’: Rock-Paper-Scissors, Warcraft III style

Example 2: Matching Pennies

This game is a simple alternative to flipping a coin or playing rock-paper-scissors
if you want to see who is going to pick up the bar tab. One player (in this case Player
1) is hoping to match, and the other is hoping not to match. Each player secretly
chooses heads or tails with a penny, and both players simultaneously reveal their
choices. If the choices match, Player 1 wins; if they don’t, Player 2 wins.
Note that matching pennies (along with rock-paper-scissors) is one of the few
game-theory style games that people actually play in a more or less “pure” form in
real life.
In real-life games—think for example of an RTS or a console fighting game—the
abstract subgames2 contained within them tend to be referred to as “rock-paperscissors.” In fact, they are often matching pennies, especially when they have a
move-countermove feel to them. To take an example from game designer David Sirlin,3
in Virtua Fighter 3 one player might have the option to throw his opponent, which

Japanese word for “reading”).

she can defeat by using a throw escape. He can counter this by using double palm,
which she can defeat with a block. The block is in turn countered by the original
throw (as Sirlin points out, being able to counter the fourth move with the first is a
general phenomenon; thinking in terms of matching pennies helps one see why).
Example 2’: Matching Pennies, Virtua Fighter style

III. Analyzing Games: Dominance and Nash Equilibria
Example 3

There’s no name for this example (based on an equally nameless example in Kreps’s
book, Game Theory and Economic Modelling); we’ve created it just to illustrate some
points. Let’s think about how our presumably clever players would play this
game.
Looking at the game, we see some spots Player 1 would like to get to, like that juicy
6 payoff if Player 1 plays A and Player 2 plays Y. Similarly Player 2 would love to get
the 8 payoff in the bottom right. (Remember neither player cares about what payoff
the other player gets.)
One thing to notice is that for Player 1, strategy B is better in every way than strategy C: if Player 2 plays X, then Player 1 would rather get 5 than 2, and if Player 2
plays Y, then Player 1 would rather get 3 than 1. So (for Player 1, which is all that
matters since they’re her strategies) strategy B dominates strategy C.
Thus Player 1 will never play C (remember she’s smart) and Player 2 knows it. So
really the above game is as shown below.

Appendixes

249

Example 3: Continued

But in this game, we see that for Player 2, X dominates Y (in each case, it’s a payoff
of 2 for Player 2 rather than a payoff of 1). So Player 2 should definitely play X.
Knowing that Player 2 is paying X, Player 1 now knows to play B rather than A.
So the end result is that Player 1 should play B, and Player 2 should play X. They
will receive payoffs of 5 and 2 respectively.
Many simple games can be analyzed using this method: deleting the dominated
strategies one after another until the answer emerges.
Note that the B/X outcome of 5, 2 has an interesting property: neither player would
want to move away from it unilaterally. In other words, knowing that Player 1 is
playing B, Player 2 can’t improve her position by switching from X to some other
strategy (in this case, Y is the only other choice). Likewise, knowing that Player 2 is
playing X, Player 1 can’t improve his position by switching from B to some other
strategy (A or C). An outcome with this property (that neither player can improve his
or her position by changing strategies unilaterally) is called a Nash equilibrium (or
occasionally just plain “equilibrium”).
One naturally thinks of Nash equilibria as the “best” solutions, since neither player
can improve by switching. There’s some truth to that, but there is some trickiness
going on as well, as we’ll see by looking at some more examples.

A Few More Examples

Example 4: Prisoner’s Dilemma

Two criminals are arrested on suspicion of a robbery, but there isn’t enough evidence
to convict them. They are both taken to separate rooms and interrogated. If they both

250

Chapter 8

keep quiet, they’ll be released (and get to split the money they’ve stolen). If one of
them betrays the other, the betrayer will get off free (and get all the money) while the
other goes to jail for a long time. If they both betray each other, they both go to jail
for a while.
Note that for Player 1, the strategy Betray strictly dominates the strategy Keep Quiet:
if Player 2 keeps quiet, Player 1 gets 2 instead of 1, and if Player 2 betrays, Player 1
gets –3 instead of –5. Similarly Betray dominates Keep Quiet for Player 2.
So each player should (given our assumptions about how our players will operate)
choose Betray. And –3, –3 is indeed a Nash equilibrium: neither player can move off
it and do better. But it’s hard to think of it as the “best” result: each player does worse
than they’d do if they both kept quiet! Nevertheless, the “game-theory answer” is that
–3, –3 is the “right” place for the game to end up.
This analysis bothers a lot of people. If one wants to support the idea that it’s
rational for both players to keep quiet, there are a number of approaches. Perhaps the
players do care about supporting each other, or perhaps they expect they will pay
some penalty for betrayal (maybe in future games). In either case, the payoff structure
will change (options involving betrayal now give fewer points to the betraying player),
presumably leading to a different equilibrium. Or perhaps one wants to look at different ideas of “best” or “rational” solution, ones other than the Nash equilibrium.
But it’s hard to escape the logic that if the above grid accurately represents the interests
of the players, and if the players pursue their own interests exclusively, the result will
be the (nonoptimal) –3, –3.
A multiplayer analog to this situation is the classic “tragedy of the commons” from
economics: many different actors share a common resource—say common land for
sheep grazing—that they can profit from individually, although the costs are borne
by all. Each actor has an incentive to overuse the resource, with the result that it is
“irrationally” destroyed (irrational in the sense that everyone is worse off than if all
had decided to use the resource moderately), even though each individual acted rationally. Overfishing, pollution generally, and global warming in particular are all examples of this problem in the real world. The lesson of the tragedy of the commons is
generally taken to be one of the failure of unregulated access to common resources,
but the suggested cures vary widely: from privatization of the common resource to
government regulation limiting the ability of the actors to exploit it.
Example 5: Battle of the Sexes

Appendixes

251

A married couple wishes to spend an evening together. Spouse 1 prefers opera;
Spouse 2 prefers football. But each cares mainly about spending the evening together.
If for some reason they had to decide what to do without communicating, what should
happen?
Note there are two Nash equilibria, Opera/Opera and Football/Football: given that
the couple has landed on either one, neither spouse at that point wishes to move off.
But which equilibrium? Spouse 1 hopes for the first; Spouse 2 would prefer the second.
In the absence of some sort of prior coordination (i.e., if they really are deciding
independently and simultaneously as we’ve been assuming) it’s hard to see how they
can decide. If they each go for their own favorite, they could wind up separate and
unhappy; if one decides to pick the other’s favorite, there’s no way to know if the
other has done the same, leading also to an evening spent separately. This game is a
very simple model for a problem in coordination.

Some birds (or perhaps nations) have a choice between two strategies: be very
aggressive in confrontations over some resource like food, or give way. Two hawks will
