example, but there are other possibilities too. In Cacao players can move up
a field-watering track. The track spaces are marked −10, −4, −1, 0, 2, 4, 7,
11, 16. Setting the track to start negative is mathematically uninteresting on
its own. Instead, we will calculate the difference between values, which is to
say, what is the actual point gain as you move from space to space. In this
progression, the increase is 6, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5. As you can see, the first half

426

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

is a declining sequence that scores well initially but yields sharply diminishing
returns. The second half is a rising triangular sequence (you may notice that
the 2, 4, 7, 11, 16 is our familiar 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, but with one added to each
number). The marginal returns are highest at the beginning and the end of the
curve, and the middle of the curve is least valuable. Players are incentivized
to either water a little, or a lot, but not a middling amount. This incentive is
similar to the one in Animals On Board, in which players score a few points for
singleton animals on their arks, and score maximum values for sets of three
or more, but don’t score anything for sets of two, which must be surrendered
to Noah, who evidently holds the patent on pairing animals up.

Tile-Laying

Description
Set-collection mechanisms with spatial elements. There are other aspects to
Tile-Laying games like Area-Majority scoring (ARC-02) that we won’t cover
in this section.

Discussion
Tile-Laying is typically thought of as its own mechanism or family of
mechanisms, and that perspective is reasonable. As we examine the patterns
and relationships underlying Tile-Laying, set-collection emerges as one of the
foundational mechanisms of the genre, hence its inclusion in this chapter.
Carcassonne’s city-completion scoring demonstrates the point: a completed
city, which is a set of tiles arranged in a specific way, scores higher than the
sum of the value of each tile. Tile-Laying introduces ideas of adjacency and

428

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

spatial relationships to sets, either as new requirements for set validity, or as
buffs and nerfs to the valuation of sets.
At its simplest, tile-matching of some kind defines whether a tile may be
played at all. In Kingdomino, players must match at least one end of the domino
played to one on the table in order to make a valid play. The actual value of the
tiles is determined based on a secondary mechanism of accumulating crown
tiles. Latice requires that a tile match all of its neighbors by sharing a color or
an animal type. Tiles played to match multiple tiles at the same time earn a
player extra turns, a scoring mechanism, since the first player to lay all their
tiles wins. Each of these plays is a set-completing play.
Qwirkle requires players to place tiles such that they match either the color
or shape (but not both) of the other tiles in their row or column. Players are, in
essence, forming sets of either shapes or colors in a line. Völuspá has a variety
of tiles, and each has its own placement and scoring mechanisms, often with
set collection features. For example, Fenris tiles are more powerful if in a line
with other Fenris tiles, and no tiles may be placed adjacent to Troll tiles.
Alhambra has a light touch on tile placement, but incentivizes players
through other means. Tile edges can either have walls or be open. Wall edges
may only be placed next to walls, and open to open, but otherwise players are
free to place tiles as desired. However, a bonus is given to the player who has
the longest continuous wall running around the outside edge of their tiles,
which can force players going for this bonus to change their valuation of
certain tiles. Otherwise, Alhambra uses a basic area-majority system.
Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King employs a large variety of possible
sets that can be scored across the tiles that players collect. Some involve
adjacencies, others look for region completion, while others are indifferent
to spatial layouts. Some sets only score if they are the largest, a kind of
Area-Majority concept (ARC-02) that is not uncommon to Tile-Laying
games.
The idea of sets scoring regardless of spatial relationships, what we might
call a global presence mechanism, is very common. Suburbia features buildings
whose powers trigger or pay off based on adjacent tiles in some cases, and on
tiles in a player’s city, or even in other players’ cities. Between Two Cities and
Quadropolis offer similar set-scoring rules for tiles of various kinds, based on
their spatial relationships to themselves, or to other tile types. Another type
of set, an enclosing set, can be seen in Rome: City of Marble. Sets of tiles score
based on enclosing and completing a hexagon, and the specific combination
of colors, the flavor of the set, determines how well it scores, with sets of a

Set Collection

429

single color scoring best. The aforementioned Alhambra allows players to score
for same-color tile sets, regardless of their adjacency.

Grid Coverage

Description
A family of mechanisms in which players cover a grid or fill a space using a
variety of shapes.

Discussion
There’s a rich mathematical background to how different shapes can fill a
two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional volume, and as a result, many
games that operate on this basic framework. Undoubtedly, many of these
aren’t really set-collection games, but many are. In Patchwork, players are
trying to acquire the set of tiles that will allow them to fully tessellate their
9 × 9 grids. Tiles have a calculable valuation: each tile covers some number
of spaces, and each uncovered space is −2 Victory Points (VPs). Tiles may
also feature buttons, which are worth 1 VP per payout space that will be
activated. However, simply adding up these values doesn’t give the true value
of the tile, because how well it fits on the board, and which other pieces it
allows to still be placed is crucially important too. In this manner, the game
is a set-collection game: the value of the tiles is greater than the sum of the
parts.
The Princes of Florence has a similar mechanism, with players acquiring
differently shaped tiles to fit into their palazzos. Since pieces can’t be moved
once placed, players are forced to plan ahead. It also changes the valuation

Set Collection

431

of tiles for different players, as some shapes will be more valuable for certain
players.
In A Feast for Odin, various-shaped goods and treasures are added to grids
to try to cover as many spaces as possible. The way the tiles are laid also
determines income, VPs, and bonuses. All are mediated through a variety
of grids. Grid-Coverage games sometimes take advantage of the underlying
grid itself to create another dimension of value. In Bärenpark, players lay
polyominoes on top of icons in a grid made of a series of square tiles. These
icons allow players to draw tiles of different sizes, shapes and point values for
future play. In addition, players are incentivized to fully cover each square grid
tile sooner rather than later, since the value of completing a grid tile declines
after each player completes one.
Admittedly, Grid-Coverage games don’t always involve set-collection in
any recognizable way, like Blokus and Ubongo. Ubongo is strictly a speedpuzzle game, where players are trying to solve Grid-Coverage puzzles using
standard tiles faster than their opponents. Blokus has a placement rule that
restricts where pieces may be placed: pieces of the same color may only touch
at corners. Similar placement restriction rules underlie many spatial games.
There may be other lenses through which to consider these games, like Area
Majority/Influence (ARC-02).
Other examples of games about packing shapes into a defined space
include Pack & Stack and You Need Drew’s Truck. In these games, players
are trying to pack Tetris-style pieces into trucks as efficiently as possible.
FITS, Brikks, and Rolltris are more obviously based on Tetris, as players
attempt to organize pieces that “drop” from the top edge of the grid.
While typically leaving spaces uncovered is bad, FITS has special bonus
spaces that score more when left open, similar to bonuses in A Feast for
Odin.
NBMR9 extends Grid Coverage into three dimensions. Tiles are worth
more as they are stacked on top of other tiles, but they may only be stacked
if they are fully supported with no overhang.

Network Building

Description
Network Building is a specialized kind of set collection in which the sets
collected represent ties between nodes, often represented as routes between
destinations.

Discussion
Earlier in this chapter, we discussed Ticket to Ride as having a basic Rummylike set-collection mechanism that allows players to build routes in specific
places based on the color and number of train cards they collected. But there’s
another dimension, another kind of set that players collect in Ticket to Ride:
the eponymous tickets themselves. A ticket can be satisfied by an enormous
number of possible route combinations, or sets, that connect the two cities
listed. The tickets represent a set of sets, or a super-set, a kind of telescoping
set of set-collection mechanisms. Brass offers a similar concept in that not only
are players seeking to connect certain cities, they are also seeking to ensure the
availability of certain raw materials within the network created.

434

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Considering sets in this way illuminates the issue of set element exclusivity.
While some games require each set element to be part of only one set, (like
in SET, the pattern recognition game) route-building games typically make
routes permanent, and allow those routes to be reused as part of other sets,
or to be subsumed entirely into a larger set. The visual representation of the
set as nodes and ties makes it really easy for players to understand why this
mechanism works the way it does.
Route-building games have many other elements to them beyond set
collection. Blocking other players, dealing with different types of terrain,
and upgrading the vehicles that run on these routes are just a few of these
elements. We will look at a few of those next. Yet, underneath all of that
is the core notion that by linking together a few nodes into a contiguous
relationship, you create a whole that is more valuable than the sum of its
parts.
There are several options available to the designer in terms of how the
network is created. The three most commonly used are Point-to-Point, Tile
Placement, and Existing Network. In a Point-to-Point system, the map is a
regular grid of dots or connections, and players may connect any two adjacent
dots. Examples of this are Empire Builder, where the connections are drawn
with markers on a dry-erase surface, and Transamerica, where players place
wooden sticks to connect dots, similar to roads in Catan. Point-to-Point
connections can either be owned by a particular player (Empire Builder,
Catan), or be neutral and usable by all (Transamerica).
In Tile Placement systems, players place (typically) square or hexagonal tiles
onto a grid to form connections. Streetcar and Tsuro use square tiles, while
Age of Steam and 1830 use hexagons. The requirement to form connections as
tiles are placed can act as constraints on which tiles may be placed, as in TileLaying (SET-02), as edges need to match up. Tile Placement games allow for
more complex tiles, including connections that go under or over each other,
or branch off. It also allows for Upgrade systems (ECO-11), where tiles are
replaced with more complex or valuable tiles. This is particularly used in rail
games like 1830.
The boards in Existing Network systems have the routes already printed
on them. Players need to claim, construct, or activate them in some way. For
example, in Ticket To Ride, all the possible rail lines are on the map, but need
to be claimed by players through the playing of sets of cars. In Rail Baron and
Power Grid, players pay to control connections.
Point-to-Point systems work well when there are a lot of possible
connections players may want to make. The random cities that need to

Set Collection

435

be connected in Transamerica, or the wide variety of pick-up-and-deliver
locations in Empire Builder make them well suited to give players ultimate
flexibility on how to build their network. However, if there are stereotypical
connections that are always made, an Existing Network system may
work better. In Power Grid ’s original incarnation as Funkenshlag, players
drew power lines on the board with markers. However, build patterns
were pretty standard, so when the game was released again, the switch
was made to an Existing Network system, which earned a much better
reception by players.
Network-Building mechanisms tend to dominate gameplay. Most games
that use them do so as a centerpiece of the design. However, there are some
games where the network construction is a side-show in the main game.
One example is the investigative game Android, where players may make
connections between entities on a separate Conspiracy board which can give
bonuses and impact victory points.
Because of the tactile nature of building networks, a variety of
other physical media have been used besides those mentioned. Some
examples include Twixt, which uses an ingenious peg-and-link system,
String Railway, where players lay string on the table to represent rail lines,
and Paperclip Railways, which does something similar with paper clips,
except that clips can be added to chains to represent additional rails being
built.

Combo Abilities

Description
A collection of Abilities that are acquired separately and synergize together.

Discussion
Earlier, in Set Valuation (SET-01), we discussed using sets as resources or as
direct point-scoring elements. Here, we focus on sets as game verbs and adverbs,
as elements that provide actions (verbs) or buffs (adverbs) to actions.
Combos are an emergent aspect of gameplay, in that they aren’t explicitly
explained in the rules, even though effective play usually requires finding
strong Combos. For designers who wish to cultivate this kind of play in their
games, there are some best practices to follow.
Games with Combo potential usually have a modular, black-box approach
to actions, which tend to be direct and non-contingent. It also helps to have a
few types of resources, and a variety of domains within which game elements

438

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

can exist. Finally, more open turn structures, with more options for how to
play help create a Combo dynamic. Card games like Seasons illustrate this
well. Cards can exist in a deck, a hand, or in play. Actions that move cards
from deck to hand create a chain that allows another play. Resources that can
be converted into effects, or more resources, create the possibility of virtuous
spirals. And the existence of dice opens up a whole dimension of possibilities
for altering die-faces and rerolling dice.
Combos exist in many games, perhaps most famously in Magic: The
Gathering. However, when played in constructed formats, where players build
their own decks before play, the set collection aspect of the game exists largely
in the purchasing of cards. In draft formats, however, players who can identify
and select synergistic cards are in essence defining and collecting sets. What
makes this type of set collection different from the set collection of a game like
Coloretto is that the sets in Magic: The Gathering are not predefined or fixed.
While the designers have certainly intended many of the powerful effects of
certain card combinations, by not explicitly declaring these combinations as
sets, they preserve the joy of discovery for players.
In Kemet, acquiring tiles that enhance your movement ability can synergize
with a tile that forces your opponent to take casualties before a battle
commences. Together, these two Abilities make for a potent combination that
allows you to project force across the board. Kemet has many other synergies
hiding among the power tiles that players can acquire.
Many games have these kinds of Combos, and identifying and assembling
a Combo and then running it is the core of the gameplay. Many so-called
engine-building games are precisely this: getting together a few elements
that create a virtuous cycle of increasing productivity. Some games have you
building actual engines, like Steampunk Rally, while in others, the engine is
more metaphoric, like the combinations of Abilities and scoring that you can
build in Race for the Galaxy. In Orléans, a specific set of workers is required to
trigger taking an action. The 7th Continent has a crafting system that allows
players to combine cards, and Evolution features a similar system to provide
creatures with traits, and even to create multiple species with complementary
Abilities that model symbiotic biological relationships. Glory to Rome and its
spiritual successor, Mottainai, can best be described as games that challenge
players to assemble a set of cards that add up to a game-breaking Combo.
We’ll end by reflecting that set collection is a dynamic, a pattern common
to many games that is instantiated by a number of mechanisms, including
those that define acquisition, usage, and valuation. Like with Auctions
(Chapter 8), at some point we begin to observe set-collection elements within

Set Collection

439

nearly every game. That observation, though interesting, may not be useful
to the working designer. Set collection as a concept may be everywhere, but
set collection as a mechanism exists in fewer places.

Card Mechanisms

ӶӶ
Card games go back to the first millennium CE, possibly as early as the 800s
in China, and by 1400, variations on the now-familiar 4-suit, 52-card deck
are attested to in Persia, the Middle East, and Europe. All of this is to say
that card games and their attendant mechanisms have been around for a long,
long time.
Core concepts in card games include a face-down draw deck from which
players can draw cards privately into a hand; the public table where all players
can see and interact with cards; the tableau, a private, but visible play area;
and the discard pile, which has varying rules for interaction. The various types
of runs and sets, predicated on the ranks and suits of cards, have different
implications for different games, as does the existence of “joker” or wild cards
in a variety of flavors.
Overall goals of card games might include shedding cards from a hand,
capturing or avoiding specific cards, collecting a larger number of cards than
the opponent, winning a specified number of hands, defeating attacks from
other players, and aligning outcomes to bids. Card games have rules about
hand limits, how cards may be acquired, used, and discarded, how turn order
may be manipulated, and what the specific composition of cards in the deck
must be.
Broadly, we can speak of trick-taking games, shedding games, and handcomparison games, though there is substantial hybridization. Trick-taking
games focus on card comparison in card-by-card and turn-by-turn play, often
tied to some contract or bid that players seek to make. Shedding games are
games in which players seek to get rid of their cards first, like in Rummy-style
games. Ladder-climbing games, a hybrid type, are a combination of tricktaking games and shedding games that are especially popular. Players shed
441

442

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

their hands by laying down a valid set, like in Rummy, but compete for the
right to lead a new ladder by playing the highest-ranked cards of that set.
Hand-comparison games often involve betting, like Poker and Blackjack, where
players compare hands based on some standard ranking of hands. The action
in these games is in acquiring the set, rather than grouping an existing hand
into a few sets and playing them out.
Modern card games sometimes follow these models fairly closely. There
are many Rummy, trick-taking, climbing, and even Poker variants, from the
Mystery Rummy series to Tichu to Pyramid Poker. However, there is a new
school of modern card games that shares basic ideas about decks and hands
with classic card games, but little about the nature and meaning of the cards
themselves.
It will take a better work of history to properly trace the evolution of
card games and to disentangle the influence of collectible card games from
the emergence of card-based versions of middle-weight European-style board
games. However, modern design embraces cards as flexible game elements
that function almost as rulebook additions. Cards carry a small payload of
additional rules that define how they may be used, while possibly also sharing
broader characteristics like suits, costs, prerequisites, bindings to other game
elements, and more.
We cover many mechanisms throughout this book that are often
implemented with cards, and there’s probably no truly satisfying definition
for the category of card games. Nonetheless, in this section, we’ll explore
some of the major concepts and mechanisms that feature regularly in card
games and games played mostly with cards, that we haven’t already addressed
elsewhere in this volume.

Card Mechanisms

CAR-01

Trick Taking

Description
Players play cards from their hand to the table in a series of rounds, or “tricks”
which are each evaluated separately to determine a winner and to apply other
potential effects.

Discussion
Trick-Taking games are about 1,000 years old, and as such, there many games,
variations and scoring rules. Covering all those possibilities is beyond our
scope, and we will instead focus briefly on the core concepts.
Trick-Taking games begin with dealing cards out. In classic games, like
Bridge and Spades, all cards are dealt out evenly to the players. Some games
have a betting phase in which players declare the number of tricks they intend
to take. After this, players play in turn order, starting with the first player,
called the lead. Many games require that players “follow the lead” or “follow
suit,” which means playing a card of the same suit as the lead, if possible. The
player playing the highest card of the lead suit wins the trick, and becomes the
lead for the next round. Often, one suit is the “trump” suit, and cards of that
suit outrank cards of the lead suit, no matter their numerical value. Finally,
players score for the number of tricks they’ve won.
Designers have created variations of all of these core rules. In Diamonds,
rather than dealing the entire deck, a subset of the deck is dealt out, which

444

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

creates uncertainty and lowers the impact of memory and card counting. In
Sticheln, players do not have to follow the lead suit, and unlike most games,
where off-suit cards are disregarded when determining the winner of the
trick, here, they are considered trump! In The Bottle Imp, trump isn’t tied to
suit at all. Instead, only a single card may be trump at any given time: the
card closest to, but not exceeding, the value of the bottle, which begins at
19. As lower numbers are played, the bottle takes on the value of those cards.
A related approach is featured in Little Devils, where the second card played
to the trick will set the rule for the trick: if the card is lower, all proceeding
players must play lower, and if it is higher, they must play higher. The game
also features the variation that winning tricks is a negative outcome. Going
back to Sticheln, players want to win tricks, but every round all players choose
a “pain” suit whose cards will count against them, and try to win tricks while
avoiding taking cards from their pain suit.
Betting can also feature variations. In Bridge, for example, the bid for
a contract includes the right to determine which suit will be trump. Only
the team that wins the bidding can score points for making its contract.
Trick-Taking games are often played in partnership, and the bidding phase
will typically have players taking turns bidding, alternating between the two
teams. In some games, like Wizard, the sum total of tricks that players bid
cannot equal the number of tricks in the hand. This guarantees that at least
one player or partnership will miss their bid. Another common variant is the
impact of “over-booking” or “over-tricking,” which is collecting more tricks
than the contract called for. Whether over-booking is more valuable, equal in
value, or less valuable than the tricks contracted for varies from game to game.
In “exact bid” games like Sluff Off, over-tricking may even be penalized.
Trick-Taking games share many features and dynamics with both OnceAround Auction (AUC-07) and Sealed-Bid Auction (AUC-04), as unintuitive
as that may sound. Readers curious about this should study Trick of the Rails,
a card game that models 18xx-style games and uses Trick Taking in place of
auctions. A Trick-Taking game is similar to an auction in that players hold
a hand of currency, and bid that currency to win the trick. The currency
is not consistent in relative value, because the exact same trick might be
won by different cards depending on which card was led, and what suit is
trump. In addition, the lot up for bid—the cards of the trick—is also what’s
being used to bid. This kind of dynamic is how a wager usually works; you
commit money to the pot, hoping to win the pot, which is composed of all
the bids. Trick-Taking games may be described as highly specialized auctions,
at least mathematically speaking. From a game-design perspective, however,

Card Mechanisms

445

Trick-Taking games typically emphasize hand-management and planning
skills, rather than valuation skills, and the experiential difference between a
series of auctions and a hand of tricks is substantial as well.

Ladder Climbing

Description
Players play one card, or a set of related cards. Subsequently, players must
play cards of an equal or higher value of the same set already played. The last
player to successfully play wins the right to start a new round of Climbing.

Discussion
Ladder Climbing games, or simply Climbing games, are closely related to
trick-taking games. The two began to differentiate geographically, with
Western games in Europe developing around winning tricks and trump suits,
and Eastern games in China, Korea, and Japan developing around shedding
hands and playing sets.
The simplest Climbing games, like President (also known as Scum, Bum,
Landlord, and Capitalism among many others), have players playing single
cards, doubles, triples, or quads. Subsequent plays must follow the set, but be
of an equal or higher rank, for example, following three 8s with three 10s.
More complex sets, like in Haggis, include runs, or sequences of consecutive

Card Mechanisms

447

cards, or runs of paired cards. Bombs, unbeatable combinations that can be
played no matter what set preceded them, are another wrinkle in this genre.
Shedding all your cards, also called “going out” is generally a goal in
Climbing games, and in many classic shedding games it is the win condition.
In some games, like The Great Dalmuti, play continues until all but one player
has gone out, and players are ranked in order of going out. Going out isn’t
necessarily the win condition. Some games, like Tichu, reward the player
who goes out first with points for doing so, while also granting points for the
specific contents of tricks won.
Climbing games offer many of the same kinds of variations as trick-taking
games. Bidding, partnerships, and wild cards are all common. Another
popular variation is the pyramidal deck, as in The Great Dalmuti, which
is a deck of ranked cards with a quantity of cards in each rank equal to the
value of the rank. Thus, there are eight 8s, nine 9s, etc. Taking this idea even
further, Custom Heroes introduces plastic cards that are placed in sleeves.
Adding more cards to a sleeve can change the card’s value or introduce special
abilities to the card.

Melding and Splaying

Description
A set of cards in a specific relationship to one another that allows them to
be played to a table or scored is a meld. When laying these cards down, the
way the cards splay, or overlap one another, may sometimes reveal or conceal
certain abilities or attributes.

Discussion
Melds are a kind of Set Collection (Chapter 12) that are very common in card
games. Classic card games typically allow melds of identical cards, sometimes
called a set, or melds containing cards in a fixed series, for example, ascending
by one, usually called a run. Rummikub is one example of a game that includes
both types of melds.
Commonly, players must assemble a meld in their hands and only then
play the melds out onto the table. In Rummy and its many variants, melds
played out on the table can be added to by other players, sometimes called
“laying off ”—but only if they have already played a meld themselves. In
Rummikub, players may disassemble and reassemble any melds on the table, as
they seek to lay off more tiles from their hands into these new arrangements.

Card Mechanisms

449

Splaying is an unusual mechanism that takes advantage of the physicality
of cards. Innovation is probably the best-known game with this mechanism.
A meld, when played, must be splayed in a specific fashion, so that certain
icons on cards will be covered by their neighbor. Later effects may allow
players to splay out further horizontally, revealing another set of icons, or even
splay vertically, revealing icons on the bottom of the cards. In …and then, we
held hands., players must resplay their entire tableau to match their position
on the board: if they are on the left side of the board, they may only see and
use the left side of their tableau, and vice versa. In Lotus, cards are splayed in
sets to look like flowers, which achieves a beautiful visual effect, albeit without
any gameplay effects.
This kind of card overlapping exists in both Honshu and Circle the Wagons,
in which players play cards to construct territories, using the current card to
overlap some of the previous cards. However, there are no mechanisms for
changing how the cards splay once they have been laid down.

CAR-04 Card Draw, Limits
and Deck Exhaustion

Description
Games frequently limit the number of cards that may be held in a given
container, whether that is a hand, a deck, or something else. Similarly, various
game effects trigger when a deck, draw pile, or hand becomes exhausted.

Discussion
Hand Limits are a critical part of the superstructure of a game. Cards represent
options, and the more cards are held in hand, the more choices a player must
consider. In modern games, where cards are not simply members of a set, but
instead provide actions or other benefits, more cards mean more power.
In many games, there is no possibility of card advantage because card
plays and Card Draws are symmetrical and metered. In Diamonds, as in
most trick-taking games, all the cards that will be in play are dealt at the
beginning, and players each play one card per turn. In Mystery Rummy: Jack
the Ripper, as in most Rummy-style games, players draw a card into their hands
at the start of their turns, and discard one card to end their turns. Similarly,
cooperative card games tend to tightly limit card economies because of how
closely coupled those economies are with game difficulty. Forbidden Island,
for example, if played without a hand limit of artifact cards, is a substantially
easier game. Whenever a game involves collecting sets of cards, it will be
easier for players to collect sets when they can draw and keep larger numbers
of cards. Cooperative games can tweak these settings to change the challenge
level presented to the players.
This one-in-one-out static card economy is overturned by many modern
designs, and players routinely have more agency over their draws and discards.

Card Mechanisms

451

In Memoir ’44, scenario-specific rules set the draws, discards and hand limits
for each faction, which allows the designer to model military concepts like
surprise, supply lines and operational capacity. Individual cards, like “Recon,”
allow players to draw additional cards, at the cost of taking a less powerful
action on the map. In Evolution: The Beginning, players always receive the
same number of cards each turn, but they may play as many or as few cards
as they wish, and carry over all their cards from turn to turn. Intentionally or
not, this evokes the idea of punctuated equilibrium, in which long periods of
limited speciation is punctuated by moments of great activity, evolutionarily
speaking.
Ticket to Ride similarly doesn’t encumber players with a hand limit, but
imposes a draw limit of two (one if you draw a face-up wild train from the
display). Players may lay down melds of any size though, so long as a matching
route in size and color is available on the board. Thus, player hand-size
fluctuates throughout the game, and skilled players will consider the potential
moves their opponents can make based on the number of cards in their hands.
Bohnanza requires players to draw, and either plant or trade, a fixed number
of cards from the deck each turn. These cards can then be supplemented by
any number of cards in hand.
Some games treat Card Draw as similar to any other resource. In Deus,
players choose to either play a card or to discard some number of cards.
Players may discard any number of cards, but one discarded card, and its suit,
determines which discard ability is triggered. The discard abilities include
gaining money, resources, buildings, or additional card draws. In Race for the
Galaxy, players must explicitly choose whether to convert goods, represented
by cards, into victory points or additional card draws.
At the other end of the spectrum from this more permissive approach to
card economies is Through the Ages, which sorely restricts card movement
from the market row into hand. Players must spend precious actions to
acquire cards from the market row, and may never exceed their hand
limit—unlike many other games that allow players to temporarily exceed
hand limits and then discard down at the end of the phase or turn. In fact,
Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization has no player-triggered discard
mechanism at all, and taking a card into hand comes with an enormous
opportunity cost. The hand limit is itself determined by a civilization’s
government type, and more advanced governments increase the player’s
hand-size, and thus, fairly directly, the power and possibilities of that
player’s civilization.

Deck Building

Description
Players play cards out of individual decks, seeking to acquire new cards and
to play through their decks iteratively, improving them over time through
card acquisition.

Discussion
Deck Building isn’t a single mechanism, and throughout this book we discuss
mechanisms that are also present in Deck-Building games. Nevertheless,
a core structure has emerged in deck-building games that we’ll consider
here. Though Deck Building is a relatively new mechanism and genre,
having appeared first in 2008’s Dominion, follow-ups have often mimicked
Dominion’s basic structures. The basic idea is that cards can provide actions,
currency for use only in the current turn, or victory points. In base Dominion,
nearly all the cards provide only one of each of these uses, but many deck
builders that followed combined these and offered players a choice for how
to use each card. Some games have also expanded beyond these boundaries,
like the bases that persist in players’ tableaus until they are destroyed in
Star Realms.
In many deck builders, players will dispose of their whole hand of cards
each turn. Commonly, players have a limit on the number of cards they can
play as actions, but no limit on the cards that can be played as money, though
not all cards will have a money value. While Dominion limits the number of
buy actions players can take, most follow-ups limit players to what they can
afford. Some cards allow players to draw, and then play, even more cards. At
the conclusion of their turn, players will draw back to the full hand, usually
five cards. While Dominion provided for a static, open market for cards, later

454

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

deck builders like Ascension: Deckbuilding Game and Star Realms offer players
a market row that is replenished from a randomized deck.
Acquisition methods are a good place to evoke theme, while also
addressing the inherent variability of laying out cards for purchase at random.
Valley of the Kings has a pyramidal market that allows players to buy only
the three cards at the base, after which higher level cards will drop down
into lower levels as the pyramid crumbles. This mechanism gives players
foresight, and a bit of control, over which cards will be available to their
opponents. In Eminent Domain, basic cards are acquired at no cost from a
central display, but powerful tech cards are acquired by being able to play
the requisite number of technology icons. Though there are no dependencies
and prerequisites as in an actual Tech Tree (ACT-16), the effect of making
players show a greater number of technology icons for the more powerful
cards offers a similar scaling effect. The synergies of certain combinations of
cards create more viable and powerful branches through this tiered collection
of technologies.
For readers interested in fully exploring Deck-Building mechanisms,
Dominion’s expansions are an instructive journey. Intrigue introduces negative
player interactions like forced discards. Alchemy introduces a second currency
type, and cards that can only be purchased with that currency. Seaside
introduces the ability to carry over cards from turn to turn. Prosperity adds
treasures, a new kind of resource that can be spent to trigger abilities without
using up actions. Dark Ages focuses on interactions with the discard pile,
while Adventures adds persistent cards that can be played in a future hand.
Cornucopia rewards players for collecting varieties of cards, while Guilds
introduces persistent money and reasons to spend it.
Dominion represents one approach to Deck Building, which is part of a
larger category called pool building, which includes pools built from items
other than cards. This can be entirely isomorphic to Deck Building, as in
Puzzle Strike, in which cards are replaced with custom Poker chips that are
drawn from a bag. The Poker chip component is easier to shuffle as often
as deck builders require, and is more durable when subjected to frequent
shuffling. Orléans, on the other hand, has players drawing workers out of
a bag, who can then be assigned to a variety of actions on a player’s board.
Andy Parks, designer of the deck builder Core Worlds, describes the
distinction between these games as being between drafting verbs, that is,
actions, as in most deck builders, versus drafting nouns, as in Orléans. In a
deck builder like Dominion, most cards represent an action that players can
take simply by playing the card, which is what Parks means by drafting verbs.

Card Mechanisms

455

In Orléans, players pull workers out of a bag and assign them to different
actions. However, actions require some specific combination of worker types
in order to trigger—a kind of Set Collection (Chapter 12)—rather than each
worker type having a specific type of action associated with it. Parks refers to
this as drafting nouns. His own Assault of the Giants game features drafting
adjectives—modifiers that provide bonuses and additional abilities, but that
must attach to existing cards and characters—out of the pool, presenting yet
another possible way to construct a pool builder.
Pools work well as resolution mechanisms, where they’re called chit-pull
systems. There are also games that don’t have true pool-building mechanisms,
but come very close.
In Machi Koro, players purchase numbered cards whose abilities are
triggered based on die rolls. Players can buy cards, representing the pool, and
they can buy cards that trigger on the same numbers, to increase the payouts
of specific numbers. However, players have limited impact on the overall
probability of numbers being rolled. They can choose to roll one die, or two
dice, but that’s all. In a deck builder, players can assure themselves of a zero
probability of not drawing certain cards, simply by not acquiring them. Machi
Koro doesn’t provide quite that level of control to players.
Going farther out on this mechanical limb, we can consider the placement
of settlements in Catan as a pool-building-adjacent mechanism. Even the
selection of runners in Can’t Stop shares something of this flavor. In Roll for
the Galaxy players acquire worker dice that have different faces, and different
values as goods. Players may shape their overall pool both based on which
dice they acquire, but also which dice they place back into their pool each
turn. As deck builders and collectible card games show, there is an enormous
amount of design space outlined by cards and some tokens. In addition to the
games discussed above, cooperative deck builders like Shadowrun: Crossfire,
Gloomhaven, and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game continue to blur the line
between card, board, and role-playing games. There are also variants like
no-shuffle deck builders like Aeon’s End and build-the-enemy’s deck games
like Tiny Epic Defender.

Drafting

Description
Drafting is a means of distributing cards or other game elements to players
through an ordered selection process.

Discussion
Many games can be described as a process of acquiring, manipulating, and
spending resources. One of the main distinctions between modern and classic
card games is the move away from random deals and draws and towards more
agential means of acquiring cards. Auctions are one popular method (Chapter

458

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

8), but they can be cumbersome, mathy, and intimidating to many players.
Drafting represents a quicker alternative. One way to think of a draft is that
instead of precisely valuing each lot and bidding accordingly in an auction,
players can instead ask: What do I want most right now? Do I have to take it
now, or will it be here for me next turn too?
Drafting cards is closely related to Action. Drafting (ACT-02) and Worker
Placement (Chapter 9). The core concept is the same in all of these: players
select, in turn order, something for their exclusive use. What makes card
Drafting different is the variety of design options afforded by the physicality
of the card.
The draft variant most similar to worker placement is the Rochester draft,
as exemplified in The Networks. All available cards are laid on the table, and
players each take one card on their turns. Play continues until all the cards
have been taken, or all players pass their turn. Like a worker placement game,
Rochester drafts make all options visible and available at the same time. This
can be overwhelming for players and can lead to analysis paralysis, just like
in a worker placement game. By physically removing cards from the display,
Rochester drafts simplify visually as the draft continues. Consequently, each
card is also exclusive to the player who selects it, though designers can include
multiple copies of a card if they wish for an action to be available to multiple
players. In addition, for games in which cards are taken in hand and played
in a later phase, Rochester drafts test players’ ability to recall what cards their
opponents took. In a worker placement game, the players’ pawns encode that
information visually, and everyone can see where each pawn was played.
Another simple draft mechanism is pick-and-pass. In Lords of Waterdeep,
a game effect calls for the active player to draw a hand of cards equal to the
number of players at the table, select one to keep, and pass the rest. Each
player does this in turn, until the last player is left with the last card. Some
games call for drawing one more card than the number of players, so the last
player also has a choice. This mechanism is tightly coupled to turn order.
Lords of Waterdeep leverages this coupling to provide the greatest return to the
player who triggered the effect, but designers should take care not to overly
advantage players based on turn order when using this mechanism.
To mitigate turn-order imbalances, designers can implement a snake draft,
in which the order of Drafting in round 1 is inverted in round 2, so that the
last player in the first round becomes the first player in the last round. Snake
Drafting mitigates, but does not resolve, turn-order imbalance. Assuming a
level drop-off in the values of cards, the value of the first choice in round 1
and last choice in round 2 is greater than the value of the last choice in round

Card Mechanisms

459

1 and first choice in round 2. In cases where values don’t drop off in a level
fashion, the problem remains: some positions are superior to others. Games
where the difference in value is negligible, or in which different selections
have different values for each player, may be the best place to implement snake
drafts. Most games will use a snake draft as part of some larger system, or in
setup, as in Catan’s placement of initial settlements.
One game to cleverly address this issue is Kingdomino, in which players
draft dominoes with two terrain squares on them, and add them to their
kingdom. Some squares feature crowns, which make all connected squares
of the same terrain worth one point per crown in the combined region. The
tiles are numbered, with the lowest-numbered tiles being the least valuable.
To draft the tiles, they are laid out in numbered order in a vertical display. The
player who chooses the most valuable tiles, the bottom tile in the display, will
claim that tile, but will go last in the following turn. Conversely, the player
selecting the least-valuable top tile will go first in the next round. While the
tiles have some absolute value, they will differ in relative value to each player
based on the exact terrains featured on them, and what is in each player’s
tableau already. In some cases, a player will gladly take a weaker tile, and its
better place in turn order, because of how well the tile fits in his or her own
board.
Another approach to balancing the turn-order issue of Drafting is to
have parallel pick-and-pass drafts happening simultaneously. This method,
featured in 7 Wonders, Sushi Go!, and Among the Stars, is executed by dealing
each player a hand with a number of cards equal to or greater than the number
