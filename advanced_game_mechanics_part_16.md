Static Engine

Type: Engine

Online Appendix B

Intent: Produces a steady flow of resources over time for players to consume or to
collect while playing the game.

n

n

Motivation: A static engine creates a steady flow of resources that never dries up.

Applicability
Use a static engine when:
You want to limit players’ actions without complicating the design. A static
engine forces players to think how they are going to spend their resources without
much need for long-term planning.

n

Structure

Participants
Energy that is produced by the
static engine

n

n

A source that produces energy

Actions the player can spend
energy on

n

N OT E A static engine
must provide players
with some options to
spend the resources
on. A static engine
with only one option to
spend the resources on
is of little use.

Collaborations
The source produces energy at a fixed or an unpredictable rate.

Consequences
The production rate of a static engine does not change, so the effects of the engine
on game balance are very predictable. A static engine can be the cause of imbalance
only when its production rate is not the same for all the players.

B-1

B-2

GAme meChAniCS: AdvAnCed GAme deSiGn

A static engine generally does not inspire long-term strategies: Collecting resources
from a static engine, if possible at all, will be quite obvious.

implementation
Normally, it is simple to implement a static engine: A single source that produces the
energy will suffice. It is possible to add multiple steps in the energy production, but
in general this will add little to the game.
A static engine can be made unpredictable by using some form of variation in the
production rate. An unpredictable static engine will force the player to prepare for
periods of fewer resources and reward players who make plans that can withstand
bad luck. The easiest way to create an unpredictable static engine is to use randomness to vary the output level of resources or the length of time between moments of
production, but skill or multiplayer dynamics could work as well.
The outcome of random production rates can be, but does not need to be, the same
for every player. By using an unpredictable static engine that generates the same
resources for all players, the luck factor is evened out without affecting the unpredictability. This puts more emphasis on the planning and timing that the pattern
introduces. An example would be a game in which all players secretly decide how
many resources all players can get. The lowest number will be the number of
resources to enter play for everyone, while the players who proposed the lowest can
act first. This would automatically set up some feedback from the game’s current
state to this mechanism. (This system discourages inflation.)

examples
The energy produced by the spacecraft in Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance is an example
of a static engine. The energy can be diverted to boost the player’s shields, speed, and
lasers. This is a vital strategic decision in the game, and the energy allocation can be
changed at any moment. The amount of energy generated every second is the same
for all spacecraft of the same type (Figure B.1).

In many turn-based games, the limited number of actions a player can perform in
each turn can be considered a static engine. In this case, the focus of the game is
the choice of actions, and generally players cannot save actions for later turns. The
fantasy board game Descent: Journeys in the Dark uses this mechanism. Players can
choose between one of three actions for their hero every turn: move, attack, or prepare a Special Action (Figure B.2). In our diagram, a player gets two actions every
turn and can perform the special action only once per turn. This creates five possible combinations: The player can attack twice, move twice, attack and move, attack
and do a special action, or move and do a special action.

Motivation: A dynamic engine produces a steady flow of resources and opens the

Applicability
Use a dynamic engine when you want to introduce a trade-off between long-term
investment and short-term gains. This pattern gives the player more control over
the production rate than a static engine does.

Collaborations
The dynamic engine produces energy that is consumed by a number of actions. One
action (Invest) produces upgrades that improve the energy output of the dynamic
engine. A dynamic engine allows two different types of upgrades a player can invest
in to improve its production:
n

The frequency at which energy is produced

n

The number of energy tokens generated each time

The differences between the two are subtle. A high frequency will create a steady
flow, while a high number (but low frequency) will lead to bursts of energy.

Consequences
A dynamic engine creates a powerful positive constructive feedback loop that probably needs to be balanced by some pattern implementing negative feedback, such
as any form of friction. Alternatively, balance it by using escalation to create challenges of increasing difficulty.
When using a dynamic engine, you must be careful not to create a dominant strategy, either by favoring the long-term strategy too much or by making the costs for
the long-term strategy too high.
A dynamic engine generates a distinct gameplay signature. A game that consists of
little more than a dynamic engine will cause the players to invest at first, appearing
to make little progress. Beyond a certain point, the player will start to make more
progress and needs to try to do so at the quickest possible pace.

implementation
The chance of building a dominant strategy that favors either long-term or shortterm investment is reduced when some sort of randomness is introduced in the
dynamic engine. However, the positive feedback loop that exists in an unpredictable

deSiGn PAt tern LibrAry

dynamic engine will amplify the luck a player has in the beginning of the game,
which might result in too much randomness quickly.
The outcome of random production rates can be, but does not need to be, the same
for every player. By using an unpredictable dynamic engine that generates the same
resources for all players, the luck factor is reduced without affecting the unpredictability. This puts more emphasis on the player’s chosen strategy.
Some dynamic engines allow the player to convert upgrades back into energy, usually against a lower rate than the original investment. When upgrades are expensive
and the player frequently needs large amounts of energy, this becomes a viable option.

examples
In StarCraft, one of the abilities of Space Construction Vehicle (SCV) units is to harvest minerals that can be spent on creating more SCV units to increase the mineral
harvest (Figure B.3). In its essence, this is a dynamic engine that propels the game
(although in StarCraft the number of minerals is limited and SCV units can be killed
by enemies). It immediately offers the player a long-term option (investing in many
SCV units) and a short-term option (investing in military units to attack enemies
quickly or respond to immediate threats).

The economy of The Settlers of Catan revolves around a dynamic engine affected
by chance. The roll of the dice determines which game board tiles will produce
resources at the start of each player’s turn. Building more villages increases the
chance to receive resources every turn. The player can also upgrade villages into
cities, which doubles the resource output of each tile. The Settlers of Catan gets
around the typical signature a dynamic engine creates by allowing different types
of invest actions and by measuring upgrades instead of energy to determine the
winner. See the section “Producing Progress Indirectly” in Chapter 11, “Progression
Mechanisms,” for a more detailed discussion and diagram for The Settlers of Catan.

Converter Engine

Type: Engine

Intent: Two converters set up in a loop create a surplus of resources that can be
used elsewhere in the game.

n

Motivation: Two resources that can be converted into each other fuel a feedback
loop that produces a surplus of resources. At least one of the converters must output
more resources than it takes in to create the surplus. The converter engine is a more
complicated mechanism than most other engines but also offers more opportunities
to improve the engine. As a result, a converter engine is nearly always dynamic.

n

Applicability
Use a converter engine when:
You want to create a more complex mechanism to provide the player with more
resources than a static or dynamic engine provides. (Our example converter engine
contains two interactive elements, while the dynamic engine contains only one.) It
increases the difficulty of the game because the strength and the required investment of the feedback loop are more difficult to assess.

You need multiple options and mechanics to tune the profile of the feedback

Consequences
A converter engine introduces the chance of a deadlock. When both resources dry
up, the engine stops working. Players run the risk of creating deadlocks themselves
if they forget to invest energy to get new fuel. Combine a converter engine with a
weak static engine to prevent this from happening.
A converter engine requires more work from the player, especially when the converters need to be operated manually.

implementation
The number of steps involved in the feedback loop of a converter engine strongly
affects how hard it is to make it operate efficiently. More steps increase the difficulty; fewer steps reduce the difficulty. At the same time, more steps offer additional
opportunities for tuning or adding to the engine.
With too few steps in the system, the advantages of the converter engine are limited,
and you might consider replacing it with a dynamic engine. Too many steps might
result in an engine that is cumbersome to operate and/or maintain, especially in a
board game in which the different elements of the engine usually cannot be automated.
It is possible to create an unpredictable converter engine by introducing randomness, multiplayer dynamics, or skill into the feedback loop. This complicates the
converter engine further and often increases the chance that a deadlock will occur.
Many implementations of the converter engine pattern put a limiter somewhere
in the cycle to keep the positive engine under control and to keep the engine from
producing too much energy. For example, if the number of fuel resources that can
be converted each turn is limited, the maximum rate at which the engine can run
is capped. In a Machinations diagram, you can use a gate node to limit the flow of
resources. In an automobile, the car’s engine converts fuel into energy, which drives
the fuel pump; the fuel pump consumes some of that energy to send more fuel to
the engine. This creates a positive feedback loop that is limited by the throttle.

examples
The 1980s-era space trading computer game Elite features an economy that occasionally acts as a converter engine. In Elite, every planet has its own market, selling
and buying various trade goods. Occasionally, players will discover a lucrative trade
route where they can buy one trade good at Planet A, sell it at a profit at Planet B,
and return with another good that is in high demand on Planet A again (Figure B.4).
Sometimes these routes involve three or more planets. Essentially, such a route is
converter engine. It is limited by the cargo capacity of the player’s ship, which can
be enlarged for a price. Other properties of the player’s ship might also affect the

As with dynamic engines, a positive feedback loop drives a converter engine. In most
cases, this feedback loop needs to be balanced by applying some sort of friction.

effectiveness of the converter engine: The ship’s “hyperspeed” range and its capabilities (or cost) to survive a voyage through hostile territories all affect the profitability
of particular trade routes. Eventually, trade routes become less profitable as the player’s efforts reduce the demand, and thus the price, for certain goods over time (a
mechanism that is omitted from the diagram).

The player’s location on Planet A or Planet B activates the converters that implement the trading mechanisms in the center. A few possible ship upgrades are
included on the right.
A converter engine is at the heart of Power Grid (Figure B.5), although one of the
converters is replaced by a more elaborate structure (see the section “Elaboration
and Nesting Patterns” in Chapter 7, “Design Patterns”). The players spend money
to buy fuel from a market and use that fuel to generate money in power plants.
The fiction of the game is that players generate and sell electricity. However, the
game mechanics do not model electricity itself; players simply convert fuel directly
into money. Surplus money is invested in more efficient power plants and connecting more cities to the player’s power network. The converter engine is limited:
The player can earn money only for every connected city, which effectively caps
the money output during a turn. Power Grid also has a weak static engine to prevent
deadlocks: The player will collect a small amount of money during a turn even if
the player failed to generate money through power plants. The converter engine of
Power Grid is slightly unpredictable as players can drive up the price of fuel by stockpiling it, which acts as a stopping mechanism at the same time.

Building mechanisms increase the output of the engine. If energy is required to activate building mechanisms, then a positive, constructive feedback loop is created.

Consequences
The engine building increases the difficulty of a game. It is best suited to slowerpaced games because it involves planning and strategic decisions.

implementation
Including some form of unpredictability is a good way to increase difficulty, generate varied gameplay, and avoid dominant strategies. Engine building offers many
opportunities to create unpredictability because the core engine tends to consist
of many mechanisms. The complexity of the core engine itself usually also causes
some unpredictability.
When using the engine building pattern with feedback, it is important to make sure
the positive, constructive feedback is not too strong and not too fast. In general, you
want to spread out the process of engine building over the entire game.

An engine building pattern operates without feedback when energy is not required
to activate building mechanisms. This can be a viable structure when the engine
produces different types of energy that affect the game differently and allows the
players to follow different strategies that favor particular forms of energy above others. However, it usually does require that the activation of building mechanisms is
restricted in some way.
