I’m glad you picked up Your Turn! The Guide to Great Board Game Design! I’m Scott. It’s so nice
to meet you. Since you are reading this book, I assume that you must love board games, or at
least want to learn more about them.
If I were interested enough in a book about board games to pick it up and start reading it in a
bookstore or online and if that book promised to teach me how to make great board games,
then I would need to be convinced that this book is written by an expert about board games,
or at least someone who loves board games.
I assure you that I do love board games and that you are in good and experienced hands.
Rather than rattle off my résumé,1 instead let me tell you a true story.
One of my earliest childhood memories is playing a board game. I remember huddling
together with my brother and his friends in a darkened and stuffy garage, our faces bathed in
the eerie glow of a green phosphorescent light.

1

I’ve published three board games with more on the way at the time this writing!

xxii

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

The board game was Green Ghost, published by Transogram in 1965. For those of you not
familiar with it, Green Ghost was the board game equivalent of a grade-­school Halloween
fair’s haunted house. You know the kind, where you stick your hand in a shoebox and feel
around for witches’ eyes (peeled grapes), graveyard worms (cold spaghetti), or bat’s wings
(feathers).
Even though that sounds cool, Green Ghost itself is a pretty dull spin-­and-­move affair. Its
production values, however, were through the roof. It was the first board game to feature a
glow-­in-­the-­dark game board, and its movers were sinister plastic silhouettes of black bats,
hissing cats, and looming vultures. Lording over the game board was the massive titular
Green Ghost who doubled as the game’s spinner.
All that phosphorus2 must have burned into my brain, because playing Green Ghost kick-­
started my love for all things spooky, toys that glowed in the dark, and, most importantly,
board games.
Now that I have shared what my first board game was, what was yours? Go ahead and write
down your answer. In fact, you are going to write in this book a lot, so you might as well
start now.
My first board game was: _________________________________________
After playing Green Ghost, I wanted to play more board games. I started to ask for them as
birthday gifts. One such gift was Dark Shadows: Barnabas Collins Game (1969). In it, players
raced around a board to collect the plastic bones of a vampire’s skeleton. Another early
favorite was Voice of the Mummy (1971) where you raced around a ziggurat collecting emeralds while an entombed mummy shouted curses and commands for the players to follow.3
There was a lot of racing around on a board in board games back then.

Green Ghost was reissued in 2011, right after a law was passed in the United States that reduced the amount of
phosphorus that could be used in commercial products. I considered buying the reprint, as I had lost my original
game years ago, but when I saw how weakly the board glowed compared to my memories of the original, I passed on
buying it.
3
Voice of the Mummy was an amazing game for its time. Inside the sarcophagus was a little record player that played
a plastic record. When you pressed the button, the needle would drop, and a random curse or command would play
for the player to follow. You can hear the voice of the mummy at www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAxN8a26wvM.

HI THERE!

By the way, whenever I first mention a board game in this book, I will also list the year4 that
it was released. That way, if you are curious to learn more about the game, you can look it
up online.
A great place to learn more about board games online is BoardGameGeek.com (BGG).
Not only is it one of the best board game websites, but it is one of the best websites on the
Internet. It is an incredibly dense repository of information pertaining to almost every board
game in existence, as well as reviews, how-­to-­play videos, images, rule variants, and much,
much more! Be prepared to lose several days of productivity!
In my board game design class (which Your Turn! The Guide to Great Board Game Design is
based on), I make sure that every new student joins BGG so that they can learn how to use
the website. As a game designer, you will find it to be an indispensable resource. If you are
not already a member, you should join now. Make sure to add me as your first “GeekBuddy”
when you join. (My username is Scott Rogers.)5
Now that you have joined BGG, write down your username so you don’t forget it.
My BGG username is: _______________________________________________

Sometimes different games have the exact same name, which is why I’m including the year it was published.
I know, not very original.

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Where were we? Just like many of you, I grew up playing all the old classic board games—­
games like Battleship (1931), Monopoly6 (1935), Risk (1959), and Mouse Trap7 (1963). Board
games became a main pastime for me, and my high school friends and I spent many hours
playing games. I remember that we even began creating our own variants of the game, such
as the time we combined two Risk boards to create one epic, weekend-­long game.8
Playing board games has a funny effect on people. I have found that if you play enough board
games, you start to want to make board games. Maybe that is what happened to you.
I started designing board games when I was in high school. I spent the entire summer of
1985 creating games cobbled from spare parts of other games. One of my finer designs combined Scrabble (1948) with Dungeons and Dragons (1974).
I was so obsessed with board games that when I was old enough to get a job, I wanted to get
one where I could be around board games! My first retail job was at a store called The Game
Keeper, which was one of the first board game chain stores.
While The Game Keeper mostly sold high-­end chess and backgammon sets that were carved
from ivory and rare wood and encrusted with precious metals and gemstones, it also carried
traditional mass-­market games from Risk, Monopoly, and Acquire (1964) to that classic drinking game Pass-­Out (1962) and the risqué Love Dice9 (1985).
Even though I did not know it at the time, working at The Game Keeper was the best training
ground I could have had as a future board game designer. This is because my boss insisted
that I take home every new board game we received and read the rules. He knew that if I
knew the game’s rules, I would be able to better sell the game to the customer. He was right;
but not only that, thanks to him, I learned the rules to dozens if not a hundred board games.10
That leads to the first important thing I want you to know:

At least until my father cheated one too many times as the banker!
Which was always more fun to build than to play.
8
It didn’t end well. I ended up losing within the first two hours of the game and spending the rest of the weekend
reading sci-­fi or fantasy novels while I waited to see which of my friends had won.
9
Look it up.
10
The Game Keeper was my Hamburg, Germany. In Malcolm Gladwell’s excellent 2011 book Outliers: The Story of
Success, Gladwell points out that it takes 10,000 hours for someone to become an expert in something. The Beatles
performed live more than 1,200 times for four years in Hamburg, Germany, amassing more than 10,000 hours of
playing time and therefore meeting the 10,000-­hour rule.

HI THERE!

Game designers play games.
Oh, by the way, if I ever write something important that I want you remember—like an idea
or a term—I will write it in bold so you do not miss it. I will also list it at the end of each
chapter so that way you can find it quickly.
Now “Game designers play games” might seem like a no-­brainer statement, but I am often
surprised to learn that some people think they don’t need to play games in order to make
them.11 They are wrong.
I believe that it is crucial for board game designers to play board games—­all kinds of board
games. As a game designer, you should play as many games as you can. Never turn down an
opportunity to play a game, whether you have played it before or whether you have never
even heard of it.

A Game Designer Plays All the Games!
The good news is that you will never get bored or run out of new games to play. There are so
many different types of games for you to play. Did you know that more than 5,000 new board
games are released each year? That doesn’t include the thousands of games that have been
published or have existed since the beginning of recorded history! Senet is one of them.

11

In fact, just the other day, someone asked me, “Do you need to play games in order to make them?”

xxv

xxvi

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

The game Senet dates back to 3100 BCE,12 and paintings of it can be found on the walls of
Egyptian tombs. Several copies of the game (including a miniature “travel-­sized” version)
were discovered in King Tutankhamun’s tomb. Archeologists think that Ancient Egyptians
played Senet as practice for getting their souls to the underworld.

The Royal Game of Ur, which was played by ancient Mesopotamians, is around 4,600 years
old, and its rules were rediscovered when archeologists found a stone tablet with the rules
carved on them.

Tavli, the predecessor to Backgammon (1635), dates to 476 BC. The Japanese game Go is from
the 13th century, while Chess is from the 15th century. These are known as “games from antiquity,” or, as I call them, ancient games. Amazingly, you can still play a game that old!

12

That’s more than 5,000 years ago!

HI THERE!

Many of these games are the foundation for modern abstract games like Mastermind
(1971), Othello (1973), and Azul (2017).
Classic games are “newer,” dating back to the 18th century. These types of games became
popular when European publisher John Wallis printed “instructional toys” such as The New
Game of Human Life (1790) and The Royal Game of British Sovereigns: Exhibiting the most
remarkable events in each reign from Egbert to George III (1819). Games about money and property became popular when George Parker published Banking (1883) and Elizabeth Magie
designed The Landlord’s Game in 1904. Many of these games were the foundation13 of modern classics such as The Game of Life (1960) and Monopoly.
The first hobby games were published in the 1970s. Many of these games were the modern
versions of Kriegspiel—­or war games—­from the 19th century. War-­themed games like
Panzerblitz (1970), Dunkirk: The Battle of France (1971), and Axis and Allies (1981) gave way to
fantasy and science-­fiction-themed games like Magic Realm (1977), Talisman (1983), and
Twilight Imperium (1997). These are different than mass-­market games, which are simpler
to learn, faster to play, and often geared toward a younger or family audience.
Kriegspiel and Dungeons and Dragons combined to inspire miniature games such as
Broadsides and Boarding Parties (1982), Warhammer: The Mass Combat Fantasy Role-­Playing
Game (1983), and Space Hulk (1989), some of which have miniatures battling on boards,
while others feature a more “open” play format.
Meanwhile, German games later redubbed Eurogames, took the gaming industry by storm.
Games like Settlers of Catan (1995), Carcassonne (2000), and Puerto Rico (2002) focus less on
conflict and more on strategy. As you can see, there are plenty of types of games to
choose from!

Some legitimately, others not so much.

Oh hey, I never asked you what your favorite game was. Write it down here.
My favorite game is: ________________________________________
As a game designer, not only should you play your favorite game, or only “the good ones” or
the “popular ones,” but you should play as many games as you can because each game that
you play adds to your knowledge of games. You should never turn down an offer to play a
game. You should even play “bad games.”
I can hear you asking, “Why would I want to play a ‘bad’ game?”
When you play a “bad” game (or more appropriately, a game that isn’t that “great”), you will
learn what types of gameplay you don’t like. Whatever it is that you do not like about a game,
you can avoid using it in your own game designs.
Now, I do not want you to be negative about every game that you play, but this will help you
to develop a critical eye when it comes to playing games. The more games you play, the more
you’ll start to understand how the elements of the game work together. By the way, these elements are called mechanics or mechanisms,14 and all the ways that they can be combined
are known as systems. The player’s interaction with these systems and the rules that guide
them are what we call gameplay.
The more games you play, the better you will understand all the clever ways in which a game
designer can combine mechanisms to create engaging systems and entertaining gameplay.
Mechanisms are like tools in your utility belt of tricks. The more tools you have as a game
designer, the more types of games you will know how to make. In this book, you are going to
learn about many different types of mechanisms and how to combine them to create gameplay to make many different types of games. In fact, you will design seven types of games by
the time you have completed this book.

There is still some debate over which term is more appropriate. Board gamers usually use the term
mechanism more often, but I find them to be interchangeable.

HI THERE!

You will learn the difference between all these types of games as we reach their respective
chapters. Since we are talking about what you will be learning in this book, I should mention
what kind of games this book doesn’t cover.

Role-­playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons
Collectible card games such as Magic the Gathering
Gambling games such as Poker or Blackjack15
Video game versions of board games16

The good news is that if you are interested in any of these types of games, plenty of books
have been written about them. This book is about board games and how to make them.
So, how are you going to learn how to make board games? Simple. You are going to copy me.
Throughout this book, I will step through the construction of various types of games for you
to follow along and create your own copy of each.
Contrary to what some teachers might tell you, copying isn’t a bad thing. In fact, all humans
learn by copying. I learned in art school that all the great artists of history copied other artists’ work when they were first starting out. By copying, you will learn the basics of making a game.
You will be taking these designs and turning them into your creations because I want to
make sure you have a strong foundation to build upon. Once you’ve built the game designs in
this book, then you are free to change them to your liking. I want you to build your confidence by completing all the game designs in the book; then you can go on to create your very
own game from scratch!
One last thing, at the end of each chapter, I will list the important concepts and takeaways
from the chapter to give you a handy reminder when you need it!

A game designer plays games.
You can learn by playing a game, even a bad one.
Game designers use mechanisms, rules, and systems to create gameplay.
The more games you play, the more “tools” you will add to your “tool kit”
of tricks.

Although we will be talking about many of their mechanisms.

L e t ’s Ma ke a B o ard Game!
AS I SAID in the introduction, the best way to learn how to make something is to copy
someone else. This time, that someone is me! You will start by copying me, but soon enough
you’ll learn how to make your own board game without having to copy anyone. It’ll be fun!

Until the 1980s, the most common style of board game was the “track” or “race” type. These
are games you’ve probably played like Monopoly (1935), Mouse Trap (1963), Candy Land
(1949), Parcheesi (400 AD), Sorry (1929), Backgammon (-­3000 BC), The Game of Life (1960),
and many more.
If you ask someone to draw a picture of a board game, the odds are the game they will draw a
track-­style board game. This style of game is known as a roll and move, as in “You roll your dice
and move your mice,” which is a great description of the roll-­and-­move game Mouse Trap.
And guess what? We’re going to make one.

The Game Board
Before we start, let’s talk about the board itself. The board represents where the game happens. A board is often a map of some kind—­of a world, a country, a city, a village, or a house.
It can be the schematic of a space station or the deck of a pirate ship. It can be the rings of a
circus, the layout of a summer camp, the interior of a mansion, or the tunnels and chambers
of a dungeon. The board is the microcosm where play occurs.
A board can be constructed of three-­dimensional buildings or other toy-­like structures. There
can be ramps and gears and thingamajigs that cause actions to happen like they do in games
like Mouse Trap, Tzolk’in: The Mayan Calendar (2012), or Fireball Island (1986). A board can
have electronic features built into it to talk to the player or convey information or a story like
The Omega Virus (1982) or Mall Madness (1988). The board can be as elaborate or simple as
the design calls for.
The one thing these type board games have in common is that the board is a shared space. All
players have access to this place where they can move and place their pawns/meeples, collect
resources and cards, or interact with and combat the other players. This is usually where you
find resources and currency used in the game.
The board gives the players a place to focus their attention during the game. It also creates
something special called the magic circle, an idea that was first created by Dutch historian
Johan Huizinga in his book Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-­Element in Culture. Huizinga
wrote that the magic circle is the space in which the normal rules and reality of the world are
suspended and replaced by the artificial reality of a game world. In other words, while we
gamers are in the magic circle created by the game, not only do we immerse ourselves in the
world of the game, but we also agree to follow the rules of the game—­no cheating and no
talking on your mobile phone.
Keep in mind that while the term board game is always a tabletop game, many tabletop games
do not need to have a board. Some games such as Carcassonne (2000), Descent: Journeys in the
Dark (2005), and Betrayal at House on the Hill (2004) use tiles or map pieces to create the play
space or an environment. Some games such as Star Wars: X-­Wing Miniatures Game (2012),
Wings of War: Famous Aces (2004), or Flick ’em Up! (2015) are played on a table but do not
have a designated board on which play occurs. Other games, such as Warhammer 40K (1987),
Heroscape (2004), and Dark World: Village of Fear (1993), use three-­dimensional terrain placed
on a table or other play space to indicate areas of importance. And some games such as
Werewolf (1986), The Game of Things (2002), and Bring Your Own Book (2015) don’t require
the use of a table at all to play the game.

A Brief Note About Components
In addition to a board, many board games come with components. Components are the
things that you need to make and play a game. Sometimes they are called bits, parts, or pieces.
No matter what you call them, you will need them to play a game.
Some games need only one type of component such as a deck of cards for War (date unknown)
or a set of dice for the game Farkle (1930). Other games need a lot of components that might
include pawns, tokens, money, chits, wooden cubes, player’s guides, score pads, miniature
figures, foam guns, leather cups, miniature terrain, polyhedral dice. . .you can use just about
anything as a component!

A pawn is a component that usually represents the player in the game. You might know the
word pawn from the game Chess (1475), but the term is used pretty interchangeably by game
designers. There are many different names and types of pawns, depending on what they look
like and what they are made from. For example, a plastic or metal figure is called a miniature, while a figure cut out of wood is commonly known as a meeple.1 To many in the game
industry, a pawn is called a mover because a player “moves” it around the game board.
One of the distinguishing factors of pawns is they can come in different colors such as red,
blue, yellow, and green. The color helps players remember which pawn is theirs while playing

The term was coined in 2000 by Alison Hansel during a game of Carcassonne when she mistakenly mashed together
my and people into meeple to describe the game’s wooden figures.

the game. Some gamers are particular about what color pawn they play with, but when you
are choosing colors to make your pawn in your game, you want to remember that some
­players have color blindness, which makes it difficult for them to distinguish one color
from another. We’ll be talking more about how to help players see the colors better later in
this book. In the meantime, let’s make a game!

Getting Started
I like to start designing a game by getting together all the components that I think I will need
to play the game. Sometimes, I first draw a picture of all the components to help me get my
head around the number of components that I will need.

To make and play our first game, you will need the following components:
■■
■■
■■
■■

A sheet of paper (to make the board)
A drawing implement (to draw the game)
A coin (any type)
A pawn item for each player (you can use anything you have lying around the house for
a pawn like a coin, a piece of paper with a drawing on it, a tiny car, a miniature ship, a
thimble, a metal top hat, or a toy dog)2

If these last few components sound familiar, it’s because they are from the classic game Monopoly. When Monopoly was
first created, the game was shared between friends who created their own versions of the game by hand (just like you are
doing!). Monopoly initially didn’t come with components. Players used things that were lying around the house like buttons or thimbles for pawns. When Parker Brothers, the publisher of Monopoly released the game in 1935, they included
lead miniatures made by the Dowst Manufacturing Company, who had produced toys for Cracker Jack. Many of their
toys, such as the iron and the battleship, were included in the game and have become iconic pieces since!

How to Make a Game Board
We will walk through seven easy steps to make our board game. Let’s start with the first three.
STEP 1: On your piece of paper, draw a big curving line like an S.

STEP 2: Draw a different big curving S next to the first one. This second curve should be
parallel and close, but not too close, to the first one.

STEP 3: Draw little lines to connect the two bigger lines together to make little squares all the
way up the track:

Congratulations! You have created the board for your board game! A board is considered a component too. Besides components, there is something else very important that games need:
rules. Let’s talk about rules for a moment. We will be diving deep into rules in the next chapter,
but because they’re such an important part of making games, let’s talk about the basics now.
Rules
Rules are the actions, conditions, and guidelines that the players must all agree to perform
and follow to play the game. If you don’t have rules, then you don’t have a game. It’s just that
simple. For example, you can have components, you can roll dice, you can deal out cards, and
you can move miniatures around on a board, but without rules, these actions are just play—­
meaningless fun. There’s nothing wrong with play, but if our intention is to create a game,
then we must have rules.
Following the rules might be easy for players, but for game designers, writing rules is hard.
Writing rules is hard because there are so many questions that the game designer needs to
answer for the player to play a game.
If I were to make up a game and play it with you right this moment, I would describe to you
how to play the game. However, almost always,3 the game designer is not there to tell the
Unless you happen to be at a live play testing event or a convention—­which are two of the best ways to meet a
fellow game designer!

players how to play the game or to answer the player’s questions about how to play the game.
Because a game designer is not there to help the players, the rules must do that instead.
Let’s look at our game so far. We already have so many questions about it.
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

How do we play the game?
Where do we start?
How does the player move their pawn?
How far do they move the pawn?
What’s that coin for?
How does the player win?
Who goes first?

So many questions that we need to answer! That’s okay, because we’ll learn how to answer
these questions in a moment. But in addition to rules, the players need to know their objective.
Objectives are short-­term and long-­term goals that the player has to accomplish during the
game. In some games, the objective might be to earn the most money. In other games, it
might be to defeat all the enemies. Other objectives include controlling the most territory,
earning the most victory points, figuring out a mystery before the other players, and, in our
game’s case, moving our pawn down the track.
Ah! I knew we forgot something! We need to indicate a starting point on our game! Let’s
return to the seven steps I was sharing with you for building our game.
STEP 4: Write START on the first square on one end of your track.

8

STEP 5: Next, our game needs a victory condition. A victory condition is what the player
needs to do by the end of the game, usually to win the game. A victory condition can often
cause the game to end, but not always.
Victory conditions are different than objectives in that a player usually must complete many
objectives over the course of the game to reach the victory condition. Let me repeat: a victory condition often causes a game to end, but not always. We’ll talk about this idea later.
In our game, the victory condition is “the first player to reach the FINISH square wins the
game.” I guess we need to add a FINISH square to our game!
STEP 6: Write FINISH on the last square of your track, like so:

STEP 7: Place your pawn (and any other player’s pawns) on the START square. It helps to
know where and how to begin the game.

We have created a board, we have a track, we have our pawns on the track. . .oh yeah, what’s
that coin for?
The coin is a randomizer, a component that can generate a random result, such as “heads”
and “tails.” A randomizer can take many forms—­a coin, a die, a spinner, a deck of cards, a bag
of tiles, pages of a book, etc.
In our game, let’s use the coin to move the player. Flip the coin. If you get heads, you move
one space down the track. If you get tails, you move two spaces.
Why do we need a randomizer? Because games are more fun when we don’t know who is
going to win before the game ends. A randomizer is just one way to create unpredictability
in a game. Don’t worry, we’ll learn many more ways to create randomness. We’ll also cover all
the different ways randomization can be used to create gameplay.
The Gameplay ’s the Thing
Gameplay is the interaction between the player and the game and its components.
Gameplay is the activity of playing the game.
Gameplay is what creates fun for the player. If a game is too difficult or boring, then we lose
interest. But if the gameplay engages the player, then the game is “fun.”4
Tracy Fullerton and Chris Swain, authors of The Game Designers Workshop: A Playcentric
Approach to Creating Innovative Games, have created what I think is a great definition for what
a game is.
“A game is a closed formal system that engages players in structured conflict and ends in an unequal outcome.”
Fullerton and Swain

I use Fullerton and Swain’s definition all the time when teaching my board game design class,
but I have simplified it even further to the following:
“All games must have rules, gameplay, and a victory condition.”
Me

If what you are creating doesn’t have all three of these things, then it’s not a game. It’s a toy
or a simulation or a puzzle or something else.

I don’t like to use the word fun because the term is too subjective. We’ll talk more about creating fun—­and
unfun—­later in the book.

Are There Any Unanswered Questions?
Speaking of gameplay, let’s get back to making our game! So, see if we’ve answered all our
questions.
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

How do we play the game?
Flip the coin to move your pawn down the track.
Where do we start?
Place your pawns on the START square.
How does the player move their pawn?
By flipping the coin.
How far do they move the pawn?
If you flip heads, move one square. If you flip tails, move two squares.
How does the player win?
When the first pawn lands on the FINISH square.
Who goes first?
That’s a good question!

There are many ways to determine who gets to go first. Determining the first player can
often be fun or funny—­an icebreaker for your game that encourages the players to interact
with each other.
In many children’s games, the youngest player goes first or the oldest player goes first. You
can let the theme of your game guide who gets to go first. For example, if your game is about
sailing a ship, you could have the player who has most recently been on a boat go first. If your
game is about outer space, you could have the player who most recently watched a science-­
fiction movie be the first player. If your game is about eating food, then the person who most
recently ate something goes first. You get the idea. We’ll be talking more about theme
very soon.
Rules for Our Game
Now that we have answered all our initial questions about how to play our game, we should
write down all the rules so we don’t forget them! Here are the rules for your game:
My First Game’s Rules
1. All players put their pawns on the START square.
2. The youngest player goes first.
3. Flip the coin. If the result is heads, then the player moves one space on the track. If
they get tails, they move two spaces on the track.
4. Each player takes turns flipping the coin.
5. After each player’s turn, pass the coin clockwise around the table.
6. The player whose pawn reaches the FINISH square first wins the game!

CHAPTER 1

L e t ’ s M ak e a B oa r d G am e !

Now that we have all the rules written down, we can play the game! Go ahead, play it! (I’ll wait.)
Done?

Hooray! I knew you could design a game!
Between you and me, I think we can make the game better. The heart of game design is
iteration, which means that by playing a game over and over and over and over, we can find
everything that isn’t quite right about the game,5 fix it, and improve a game design.

Let’s Make Improve the Game!
To improve your game, you should think about all the aspects that you can change. Looking
at our game, there are five fundamental aspects that we can change that will make a big difference in how the game is played.
■■
■■

A number
A component

Some game designers call when a rule or interaction or gameplay isn’t doing what they expect it to do “broken,” but
just because something is “broken” doesn’t mean it can’t be fixed. By fixing these “broken” interactions and gameplay, we make the game play better and stronger.

The theme

Change a Number
When you change the number of anything, you will change the experience of the game. For
example, let’s say that when we flip the coin, if we get heads, we move forward one space, but
if we get tails, we don’t move forward at all.
That single number change would totally change the feel of the game, wouldn’t it? Playing
the game will take longer and flipping a tail wouldn’t be very much fun, would it?
Let’s change a number again. Let’s say if we flip a head, we move forward two spaces. If we
flip a tail, we move forward three spaces. That would also change the experience and
make the game shorter.
What if we changed it to, if you flip a head, you move forward two spaces, but if you flip a tail,
you move forward five spaces? While that would make flipping tails much more exciting, it
might make the game result in an unequal outcome where one player is still only halfway
down the track when the other finishes.
The outcome and the impact the change has on all the game’s players is something that you
must keep in mind when you are adjusting—­or balancing—­your game design. A good rule
of thumb is this:
A close finish is much more exciting to all the players.
