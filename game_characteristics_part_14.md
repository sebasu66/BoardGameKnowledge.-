two-player form of solitaire). The play is simultaneous and as fast as the players want.
The first player to exhaust her tableau wins the hand and will have fewer cards in the
subsequent round. Rounds are played until one player has all the cards, at which point
that player loses.
Tarock*
A trick-taking game played with tarot cards. Contrary to common belief, tarot cards
were developed for gaming, not divination.

War*
A children’s game for two or more players. A deck is divided randomly among the
players. Every round, each player simultaneously exposes a single card. The highest
exposed card captures the trick, and the game continues with players shuffling all
their captured cards into a fresh pile when the old one is exhausted. When a player
loses all her cards she is out of the game.
BOARDGAMES, MODERN
Acquire*
An abstract game for three to six players in which players invest in hotel chains that
grow and merge over the course of play. The hotel growth is based on the play of tiles
from a hand that players are randomly dealt.
Axis & Allies*
A mass-market strategy game that is a global World War II simulation for two to five
players. Combat is resolved by dice.
Battleship *
A two-player game of guessing hidden information—the location of the opponent’s
ships. Each player hides his ships on his own 10 × 10 grid.
Candy Land **
A children’s race game similar to Chutes and Ladders using cards instead of dice, and
with a delicious candy motif.
Can’t Stop* (press-your-luck game)
A board-and-dice game in which players attempt to be the first to advance three of
eleven pieces to the end of a track. Each turn a player can roll the dice as many times
as desired, but if a bad roll is made all progress for the turn is lost.
Similar games: Yahtzee.
Clue**
A three- to six-player game of guessing hidden information with a whodunit theme.
Three cards are hidden from all players and the rest are divided between them. Players
move around the board using dice, asking questions about the other players’ cards
until someone guesses the hidden cards’ identity.
Cosmic Encounter *
A game for three to five players characterized by each player having a different “alien
power” that allows them to break or modify the rules in a prescribed manner. Each

turn players attack a random opponent, which makes long-term alliances difficult to
maintain. A player that accumulates five foreign bases wins. More than one player
can win at a time, leading to shared victories.
Cranium*
A party boardgame in which players must perform various tasks to advance along the
track. Tasks include drawing pictures, doing charades, unscrambling words, and
answering trivia. Since many of these tasks appear as the sole tasks of other games,
Cranium has the feel of a combination of several different games.
Diplomacy*
A strategic political game for six or seven players (rules exist for fewer players but the
game changes radically). The game is about the creation, maintenance, and breaking
of alliances in an attempt to take over pre–World War I Europe. Each turn is in three
phases: a negotiation period, writing down of orders, and simultaneous execution of
all players’ orders. Success in the game is only possible through cooperation (and
eventual betrayal) with other players.
Dune (Avalon Hill boardgame)*
A strategy boardgame based on Frank Herbert’s series of Dune science fiction books.
Players represent one of the powerful factions from the Dune universe and attempt
to control the resources of a fictional planet. A notable feature of the game is a complex
set of victory conditions that can allow groups of players to share a win in various
ways.
The Game of Life*
A race game for two or more players played on a spiral track, with movement being
determined by a die roll. There are squares with penalties and squares with rewards.
Not to be confused with the abstract game Life.
Kingmaker**
A strategy simulation for two to seven players set during the War of the Roses. Each
player builds and controls a faction of nobles and attempts to eliminate the other
players’ factions.
(Reiner Knizia’s) Lord of the Rings*
A cooperative game for two to five players. Players as a group advance through several
scenarios corresponding to situations in the books. Players win or lose as a group. A
later expansion puts one player in the role of Sauron, who plays against all the other
players.

Mastermind*
A two-person game of deduction. One player secretly chooses four pegs of different
colors. The other tries to guess the color combination in the fewest guesses possible,
while being told after each guess the number of pegs that are correct.
Monopoly***
A family game for two or more players in which players move around a circular track,
accumulating property and paying penalties to other players when landing on their
property. The goal is to bankrupt your opponents.
Pandemic*
A cooperative game for two to four players. Four diseases have broken out and the
players represent specialists attempting to discover cures before too much damage is
done. Players win or lose as a team.
Pictionary**
A party game for two to four teams in which the goal is to communicate words to
teammates using only drawing. It is a race game, in which teams advance by rolling
a die after successfully communicating a word.
Pinko Pallino (Quoridor)*
An abstract strategy game for two players with no overt random elements. Players
attempt to be the first to move their pawn to the opposite side of the board while
placing walls to block the pawns’ progress (walls block both pawns, but players try to
place them so as to cause more problems for their opponent’s pawn than for their
own). Quoridor is a slightly different version of the game for two to four players.
Risk**
A dice-based global conquest strategy game for two to six players. Broadly similar to
Axis & Allies but more abstract.
RoboRally*
A boardgame for two to eight players with a comical robot theme. The robots race
across the board, avoiding various obstacles while frequently shooting at or otherwise
interfering with each other. Occasionally a robot can find an “option”—piece of special
equipment—that gives it additional new powers.
Scrabble**
A game for two to four players in which players create words from hands of random
letter tiles on a board in a crossword fashion.

Settlers of Catan** (European-style boardgame)
A game of resource accumulation and building with a medieval motif, for two to four
players. Like many European boardgames, it has a light theme (rather than being a
detailed simulation), considerable random elements, and victory points that are different from the resources one uses to make in-game actions. It differs from many European
boardgames in that it has a random board setup and multiple paths to victory.
Similar games: Agricola, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, Tigris and Euphrates.
Stratego*
A boardgame with two-sided pieces. Each player sets up his pieces with the blank side
facing his opponent. The true nature of a piece is only revealed when an enemy piece
tries to capture it; at that point values are compared to see which piece wins the battle.
(Rise and Decline of the) Third Reich** (hex-based wargame)
A strategic hex-map-based World War II simulation wargame. Combat is resolved by
dice and table lookup (the so-called combat results table). Games in this genre tend
to have extremely long and complex rules.
Similar games: PanzerBlitz, Squad Leader, Tactics II.
Titan*
A fantasy-themed strategy game in which players muster and battle armies of creatures. Each battle takes place on a tactical map that is distinct from the strategic map.
Strategic movement and combat are resolved with dice.
Trivial Pursuit**
A party trivia race game for two to six sides. Sides advance by answering questions
correctly. There are many different versions of the game that focus on different areas
of knowledge.
Trouble*
A boardgame similar to Parcheesi, notable for its “Pop-o-matic” dice roller. Rather than
rolling dice in the normal fashion, players press a transparent bubble on the board that
contains the dice; on release, the bubble pops back up, rolling the dice automatically.
OTHER NONDIGITAL GAMES, MODERN
Apples to Apples*
A party game for three or more players. A rotating moderator exposes an adjective
card and each player secretly picks a noun card from her hand that she believes the
moderator will choose as most representative of that adjective.

Dungeons & Dragons*** (paper role-playing game, RPG)
A cooperative fantasy role-playing game, with a referee (the Dungeon Master) that
handles hidden information and rules adjudication. The first paper-based role-playing
game. In role-playing games, each player plays a single character with specialized
attributes and abilities, and gains more power and equipment (enabling her to face
greater challenges) as the game progresses. Computer RPGs (both single-player and
massively multiplayer) evolved from paper RPGs, but are different in many ways,
primarily due to the differences in having a computer adjudicating the game rather
than a human being.
Similar games: Vampire: The Masquerade, GURPS, Traveller, Champions, Shadowrun.
Eleusis*
A card game in which one player making up the rules is part of the game. One player
creates the rules without telling the others, and then the other players must attempt
to guess them based only on being told that various attempted actions are legal or
illegal.
Similar games: Mao, Zendo (Icehouse), Fluxx, Calvinball.
Magic: The Gathering*** (trading card game/collectable card game)
A fantasy card game generally for two players, and the first trading card game.
Trading card games are characterized by players assembling their own decks of cards
and competing with them against their opponents. There are different rules on
how a player may construct a deck, corresponding to different play formats, some of
which are
Constructed Players may use any cards they own that are in a predefined subset of
cards (e.g., all cards printed in the last two years).
Sealed Players choose a subset from a small number of randomized cards (e.g., each
player receives five packs of fifteen random cards each).
Draft Players draft cards from a small common pool (e.g., all cards found in eight
packs of fifteen random cards each).
Similar games: Pokémon trading card game, Digimon card game, Yu-gi-oh.
Nuclear War (card game)*
A game for two to six players in which players combine warhead cards with booster
cards to deliver damage to opponents of their choice. Fast paced and humorous.
Uno**
A card game with mechanics similar to the classic card game Crazy Eights. Players
attempt to play all their cards, but the only legal plays are playing the same rank or

Appendixes

suit as the preceding card. Uno adds many special cards to liven things up, which do
things like reverse the direction of play or skip players.
Warhammer 40K** (miniatures game, minis game)
A tactical miniatures wargame for two or more players set in a futuristic fantasy
world. In a wargame of this nature there are no spaces on a board—units move a
measured physical distance that is determined by the unit, its condition, and the
terrain it is moving over. Similarly, when units attack one another the physical
distance between them is measured to determine the range. An important part
of the game for many players is the collection and elaborate painting of the
miniatures.
Similar games: Chainmail, Warhammer Fantasy Battles, countless historical rulesets
(Napoleonics, Roman, U.S. Civil War, etc.).
Yahtzee**
A dice game for two or more players in which players are scored based on specific die
combinations. Each turn a player is allowed to reroll some dice up to two times.
ABSTRACT GAMES
Also see the list “‘Toy’ Games Created for the Text” below, and the various example
games discussed in appendixes A and B above.
Dots & Boxes***
A game for two played with pencil and paper on a grid of dots. Each turn a player
connects two adjacent dots. If that completes a square, the player scores that square
and takes another turn. At the end of the game the player who has scored the most
squares wins.
(Conway’s) Life**
This is sometimes described as a game for zero players. A rectangular array has some
cells that are alive and others that are not. Each generation a cell will become alive
or dead according to a simple set of rules. The behavior of the cells can be quite
complex considering how simple the starting rules are. Not to be confused with the
modern boardgame The Game of Life.
Nim****
The game starts with several piles of chips. Each player’s turn consists of taking
as many chips as he wants from a single pile. The player who takes the last chip
wins (or, depending on the rules used, loses—the two versions turn out to be

284

Chapter 8

more or less equivalent). The game is essentially impossible to decipher for a new
player until the last few steps, but is completely solved for the expert. All moves
except the exactly correct one are essentially equivalent, so a beginner has no better
or worse move, and is effectively playing randomly until close to the end of the
game.
Rock-Paper-Scissors****
A simple two-player game played using hand shapes. Each player simultaneously
chooses one of three options: rock (fist), paper (flat hand), or scissors (two fingers held
out). Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If the players
choose the same option the game is a draw (and is typically immediately replayed).
Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses)****
A two-player game played on a 3 × 3 grid. Players alternate taking one of the nine
cells. The winner is whoever first captures three cells in a row. Tic-tac-toe is typically
regarded as a child’s game, because it is easy to win or force a draw as the first player.
DIGITAL GAMES (COMPUTER, CONSOLE, HANDHELD, ARCADE)
Age of Empires*
A real-time strategy game with a flavor of historical empire building and warring.
Players collect resources, build bases and an army, advance in technology from Stone
Age to Iron Age, and battle their opponents. Originally players could play nine different cultures, and many more were introduced with expansions and sequels.
Asteroids*
An arcade game from the late 1970s in which a player uses a spaceship to shoot at a
set of asteroids moving around the screen. Each time an asteroid is shot it is replaced
with two smaller asteroids, except for the smallest asteroids, which disappear. A player
progresses through levels by destroying all the asteroids and surviving the occasional
alien ships.
Bejeweled*
A single-player game in which the player swaps pairs of jewels in an 8 × 8 grid, attempting to line up jewels of the same color.
Civilization**
A turn-based strategy game of exploration, development, and conquest set over the
course of human history—beginning in the Stone Age all the way through the exploration of Alpha Centauri. Randomized setup helps makes the game highly replayable.

Appendixes

Civilization has multiplayer versions, but it’s mostly played as a single-player game, in
large part because multiplayer play can involve a great deal of downtime.
Command & Conquer*
A real-time strategy game set in an alternate history.
Counter-Strike*
This was originally a mod (game variant) for Half-Life, and is strictly a team game with
one side being terrorists and the other counterterrorists. Unlike most multiplayer firstperson shooters, if a player is killed he does not respawn. Instead, he must watch his
team struggle on without him. Each game is quite short, so the time you spend watching is not too onerous.
Crystal Quest*
A single-player computer game in which a player attempts to collect crystals while
being harassed by enemies. If all crystals are collected the player moves on to the next
level.
Dance Dance Revolution*
A series of arcade and console games using a special controller: a pad placed on the
floor. Players step on the pad in various locations, as directed by the screen instructions and in time with the music.
Dark Age of Camelot*
A fantasy-themed massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Dark Age of Camelot
was distinctive for its large-scale player-versus-player combat.
Defense of the Ancients*
A mod (game variant) built from the Warcraft III engine. The game is for two teams
of five, with each player controlling only one unit. The object is for each team to wipe
out its opponents’ base. During the game, players will go up levels and purchase new
equipment while fighting the opponents and their computer-controlled units. One of
the attractions of the game is the wide variety of heroes each player can control, each
with mechanically distinct spells and skills. Another is the packaging of the levelingup RPG process into a thirty- to sixty-minute game (RPGs typically take tens or hundreds of hours to complete).
Diablo/Diablo II***
A computer action role-playing game. Players choose from several character classes
and fight monsters, collect loot, and become more powerful. Action role-playing
games involve some degree of coordination and fast button clicking.

Donkey Kong**
One of the first examples of a platformer—a single-player game where the player must
navigate a map, jumping, climbing, and avoiding obstacles. It is also one of the first
(if not the first) example of a complete narrative in an arcade game, complete with
cut scenes. The characters and world have been developed over time to be one of the
most popular computer game franchises today—Mario.
Dune II*
A real-time strategy game that became the design template for real-time strategy games
that followed. Other RTS-style games existed before Dune II, but Dune II marked the
point where the RTS game was recognized as a genre and the design standards were
all in place—collecting resources, building bases and technology, and ultimately battling the opponents’ units and bases.
Everquest**
A fantasy-themed massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Players have characters in a variety of races and specialties that fight against computer-generated monsters (and sometimes other characters). Over time players gain power and resources,
which allows them to handle larger challenges.
Final Fantasy** (computer role-playing game, or RPG)
A series of computer role-playing games known for their elaborate stories. In computer
role-playing games, players have one or more characters in a variety of races and
specialties that fight against computer-generated monsters. Over time characters gain
power and resources, which allows the player to handle larger challenges. In many
computer role-playing games the story is secondary to the mechanical trappings of a
role-playing game—such as combat and equipment choice—but not in the Final
Fantasy games.
Similar games: Baldur’s Gate, Fallout, Knights of the Old Republic.
Gauntlet*
A cooperative arcade game for one to four players with a fantasy RPG theme. Each
player maneuvered a single character (Warrior, Wizard, Valkyrie, or Elf) through a
maze, fighting monsters and grabbing treasure and useful items.
Guitar Hero*
A console game with a special controller: a guitar-shaped object with buttons on the
guitar’s neck. Players press the buttons and “strum” the guitar in a manner reminiscent
of playing a real guitar, in time with music and images played on-screen.
Similar games: Rock Band.

Half-Life**
A first-person shooter that was highly acclaimed for its integration of story into the
solo game.
Ico*
A third-person action game—that is, a game where you see your own character over
the shoulder. The gameplay includes both solving puzzles and fighting enemies. Ico
had a story that was acclaimed for its elegant integration into the gameplay.
Impossible Creatures*
A real-time strategy game with a mad scientist theme, in which players create their
own unique units by combining animals (unlike a normal RTS game, where the unit
types are fixed).
Karate Champ*
An early arcade fighting game; widely seen as the precursor to later fighting games
such as Street Fighter.
King Kong: see under Peter Jackson’s King Kong
Lunar Lander* (physics game)
An arcade game from 1979 in which a player attempts to land a lunar module on the
moon. The player has control of the direction and of the thrust and must touch down
on a flat surface with a low velocity. Since then, a number of other games revolving
around physics simulations, albeit more complex ones, have been created, mostly by
independent game designers.

Mario Kart ***
A computer racing game with a Mario theme. Mario Kart is distinctive for the wacky
power-ups that spawn during the course of play, allowing for players who are behind
to make spectacular comebacks.
Mario Party*
A party game in the Mario franchise. Players move on a board (as in a traditional
boardgame, using dice) with the goal of collecting stars and coins. After all players
have moved, there is a random minigame in which players compete, and that can
reward players with coins or cost them coins. The minigames are sometimes cooperative, sometimes free-for-all, and sometimes played in teams.

Masters of Orion II *
A turn-based strategy game of exploration, development, and conquest set in space
among several alien races. The randomized setup helps make this game highly
replayable.
Minesweeper*
A single-player computer game in which a grid is randomly seeded with hidden mines.
The player must reveal all the mines without detonating any of them.
MUDs (Multiple-User Dungeons)*
An early form of online multiplayer game, often text-based. MUDs were the forerunners of MMORPGs (and indeed the first MMOs were sometimes referred to as “graphical MUDs”).
Myst** (puzzle-solving game)
A game in which the player explores and solves puzzles that are naturally integrated
into the world.
Similar games: Adventure (Colossal Cave Adventure), The Longest Journey, The Secret
of Monkey Island, Zork.
Myth*
A real-time strategy game distinct for its lack of in-game resource gathering and base
and technology building. It is, instead, entirely about the battle between the units
that each side brings to the fight. For this reason the Myth series is sometimes referred
to as a real-time tactics game (the games in the Total War series are similar in this
respect).
Pac-Man*
An arcade game where the player navigates a puck-shaped character through a maze,
eating “dots” that are spread throughout the maze and avoiding ghosts that will
destroy the player on contact. Certain dots when eaten briefly reverse the roles of
hunter and hunted, allowing the player temporarily to destroy the ghosts on contact.
Peter Jackson’s King Kong*
The adventure fighting game based on Peter Jackson’s movie King Kong. The game was
somewhat unusual in having a minimalist user interface.
Pokémon*
A handheld game that spawned a whole series of other games and merchandise. In
the original game, the player controlled a character in an RPG world. Unusually, the

Appendixes

player did not fight and level up with that character, but instead collected creatures
(called Pokémon) and “trained” them (leveled them up) to fight for him.
Progress Quest*
A satirical computer role-playing game in which all decision making has been removed
and a player’s character plays automatically. A player simply watches as her character
fights monsters, loots enemies, levels up, and even completes quests.
Quake*** (first-person shooter, or FPS)
In first-person shooters players move around a virtual world in first person—that
is, the screen shows you the view you would see if you were in the world yourself,
rather than showing you a view that includes your character. Typically players
can equip a number of different weapons, mostly projectile weapons. They seek to
destroy other players or computer-generated monsters in a solo or cooperative
campaign.
Similar games: Doom, Half-Life, Halo, Wolfenstein 3D.
Q*Bert*
A single-player game in which a player hops around a lattice of cubes avoiding
enemies. When a cube is visited the color of the cube changes, and the next level is
reached when the entire lattice is changed to a particular color.
Rogue/NetHack/Angband**
Among the very earliest computer role-playing games. They are all single-player, and
the graphics were originally ASCII based—all elements of the game world, from the
map to the monsters to the characters and treasure were all letters and symbols (nowadays there are often overlays for the games that substitute simple graphics for the
ASCII characters). These games tend to be highly replayable, since the dungeons are
randomly generated.
Shadow of the Colossus*
A third-person action game—that is, a game where you see your own character over
the shoulder. Shadow of the Colossus featured only boss fights—fights against the game’s
gigantic colossi—rather than the mix of boss fights and fights against many smaller
enemies common to most such games.
Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri*
A turn-based strategy game very similar to Civilization in game mechanics, but with a
far-future science fiction theme instead of a historical theme.

Chapter 8

SimCity*
A game in which the player manages a virtual city, zoning various areas, building
infrastructure and public buildings, setting tax rates, and the like. Although there were
also scenarios with specific objectives, SimCity was noted for its “sandbox” play:
gameplay modes with no specified objectives, where the player could instead simply
try different gameplay actions and observe the consequences.
Similar games: The Sims, Roller Coaster Tycoon.
The Sims*
A sandbox-style game in the manner of SimCity. Players had partial control of a small
number of simulated humans, called sims, who had basic needs (Hunger, Hygiene,
Comfort, etc.) that could be fulfilled by means of various objects and people in their
environment. The player would set up the environment and instruct/encourage her
sims to do things to fulfill their needs. The Sims is the best-selling PC game of all time,
and has spawned numerous sequels.
Starcraft**** (real-time strategy, or RTS)
A real-time strategy PC game for two to eight. Players collect resources, build bases,
and have their armies fight other players’ armies and bases. The game is won by
destroying all opposing base buildings. Starcraft has a science fiction theme and three
races that can be played, each of which has distinct game mechanics.
Similar games: Age of Empires, Command and Conquer, Dune II, Impossible Creatures,
Total Annihilation, Warcraft I, II, and III.
Street Fighter**
An arcade fighting game. In a fighting game, players choose a character that has its
own set of combat moves, strengths, and weaknesses and battle it against another
(player-controlled or computer-controlled) character. For beginning players, the
combat itself is one of speed and reflex; for expert players, predicting and countering
the opponent’s moves become increasingly important. Additionally, in many fighting
games, characters have secret moves that need to be discovered.
Similar games: Karate Champ, Marvel vs. Capcom, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Virtua
Fighter.
Super Mario Brothers**
A platform game where players jump, climb, and dodge obstacles and enemies. This
is one of the many games in the popular Mario series.
Team Fortress*
A two-sided team shooter, notable for its character classes (Medic, Sniper, Scout, etc.).

Tetris*
A single-player game in which random shapes are dropping in a grid at a faster and
faster rate. The player can rotate each piece as it drops and choose which column it
will land in. If a row is completely filled the row disappears. Eliminating rows is necessary for the player to continue playing, because the game is lost when the grid fills
up to the top. The player can never win (a feature also seen in many arcade games),
but instead tries to get the highest possible score before finally losing.
Tomb Raider*
A third-person action game—that is, a game where you see your own character over
the shoulder. The game includes both solving puzzles and fighting enemies. Tomb
Raider featured the archeologist adventurer Lara Croft and was the basis for many
games and a movie.
Tribes*
A first-person shooter designed entirely for team play.
Warcraft I, II, and III**
A series of real-time strategy games that take place in a fantasy world. Players collect
resources, build bases and an army, advance in technology, and battle opponents.
Multiple races can be played—two in Warcraft I and II, four in Warcraft III. Warcraft III
is notable for its hero system, which evolved into the very different game Defense of
the Ancients.
Wario Ware*
A single-player game in the Mario series that is composed of a series of simple fast
minigames. Each minigame takes only a few seconds to play, so the play is fast and
frenetic. Quickly understanding how to play the next (randomly selected) minigame
is a big part of the overall game.
World of Warcraft**** (MMO, MMORPG)
A fantasy-themed massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Players have characters in a variety of races and specialties that fight against computer-generated monsters as well as (sometimes) other characters. Over time players gain power and
resources, which allow the player to handle larger challenges. There are many “games”
within World of Warcraft, some cooperative, some competitive, some of short duration,
some open-ended.

Zork*
A text-based adventure game in which players could type what their character was
going to do and the program would describe the results. Part of the charm (and, for
some players, the frustration) was that the words the game understood were not
known and had to be discovered by the player.
SPORTS
Auto racing (Formula 1, NASCAR)*
Similar to footraces, but cars are used instead of feet. There are many different formats
and rules. Due to the expense involved, high levels of sponsorship are generally a
requirement. Some formats (e.g., stock-car racing) emphasize limits on the kinds of cars
that may be used, so that all participants begin with a more or less even chance; other
formats (e.g., Formula 1) emphasize custom cars, with each entrant attempting to build
a superior car. Auto racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in the world.
Baseball***
A two-sided bat-and-ball team sport where one team plays defense on a large field
with nine players on the field while the other team plays offense with one to four
players on the field. Teams alternate offense and defense at least nine times during
the game. Teams have specialized roles for their players, some of which are supported
by the rules.
Basketball****
A team game where two teams compete against each other trying to put the ball
through the opponent’s hoop on opposite ends of a long court. Each team fields five
players at a time. There are restrictions on movement while handling the ball. Teams
often have specialized roles for their players, but these roles are not supported by the
rules. Games are played for a fixed amount of time and won on points.
Bicycle Racing**
Similar to footraces, but bicycles are used instead of feet. There are many forms of
bicycle racing, but due to the speeds involved drafting is much more important than
in footraces. Consequently many bicycle races are either team races or time trials (individual races where each cyclist races separately against the clock, with times compared
at the end). Distances commonly range from 750 meters to hundreds of miles.
Bowling*
An indoor sport in which players roll a heavy ball down a lane, attempting to knock
over the pins at the end of the lane. Although bowling is frequently played in teams

Appendixes

or leagues, the players do not interact directly, but instead compare scores at the end
of a fixed number of rounds.
Boxing*
A one-on-one sport of physical combat using fists covered with gloves. Rules vary, but
generally points are awarded for performing strikes on the opponent within certain
limitations. Victory can alternatively be achieved by knocking out the opponent,
regardless of points scored.
Calvinball*
A fictional sport from the cartoon strip Calvin & Hobbes. In Calvinball, rules
may be invented spontaneously by the players, but the same rule cannot be used
twice.
Darts*
A team or individual game where players attempt accurate throwing of darts into a
board with different target zones. There are many rule variants, which detail different
objectives on the board.
Fencing*
A one-on-one sport of physical combat using swords. Rules vary, but generally points
are awarded for performing strikes on the opponent within certain limitations.
Football (American)***
A team game where two teams compete trying to get the ball across each other’s goal
line, or through their goalposts, both sets located at opposite ends of a large field from
each other. Each team may field only eleven players at a time. At any given moment,
one team is in possession of the ball and attempting to advance it, while the other
team plays defense. Teams have highly specialized roles (or positions) for their players,
some of which have special standing under the rules. Games are played for a fixed
amount of time and won on points.
Footrace****
A multisided game where individuals attempt to be the fastest to get from the starting
line to the finish line by running. Race length varies widely, from sprints of a few
dozen yards to marathons of twenty-six miles or even longer.
Golf*
An individual sport played with a set of clubs used to strike a small hard ball across
long distances outdoors. The object is to get the ball into a small specified hole in the

least number of attempts while avoiding various natural hazards. The game is commonly played in a series of eighteen of these holes.
Hacky Sack*
Hacky Sack is a trademark for a game more properly known as footbag. Players stand
in a circle and cooperate in attempting to keep a small beanbag-like object from touching the ground by kicking it repeatedly up into the air with their feet.
Hockey*
A team game where two teams of six players on skates attempt to put a puck through
the opposing team’s goal using sticks. Each goal is located at the opposite end of a
large field of ice. Teams have specialized roles for the players, one of which in particular (the goalie) is supported by the rules. Games are played for a fixed amount of time
and won on points.
HORSE*
A game for two or more players using a standard basketball and hoop. Players attempt
to match difficult shots made by the others. Those who miss shots are assigned letters
from the word horse, losing when they spell out the entire word.
Horse Racing*
Similar to footraces but with horses instead of feet. Horse racing is an ancient sport
with a wide range of rules, but it commonly consists of one to two dozen horses
running on a circular track. The distances vary widely across the world but are usually
between 1/2 mile and 3 miles, with 1 1/4 miles being most common. The sport is
inextricably associated with spectation and gambling.
Pool*
A table game involving balls and sticks. The object is to use a stick to strike one ball,
thereby striking others and knocking them into pockets. Pool can be an individual or
team sport and in some variants is three or more sided.
Similar games: Billiards, Snooker.
Pro Wrestling*
A highly stylized and theatrical form of staged combat based on wrestling. Spectacular
violations of the rules (e.g., hitting opponents with folding chairs found near the
ring) are a common occurrence, all in the service of heightening the over-the-top
drama.

Regatta*
A boat race (compare footrace). Widely varying in rules and can involve oar-, sail-, or
motor-powered boats.
Roman Gladiatorial Combat*

individuals, weapons of many different sorts, and even animals. Primarily fought using
slaves and primarily played as a spectator sport with gambling.
Rugby*
A physical team game played on a large field sharing common ancestry with American
football. Two teams of fifteen (or, in some versions, thirteen) players attempt to score by
moving a ball across their opponent’s goal line by running with the ball or kicking it.
Soccer (Football)**
A team game where two teams of eleven players attempt to put a ball through the
opposing team’s goal. Each goal is located at the opposite end of a large field. For
the most part players are only allowed to advance the ball without the use of their
hands. Teams have specialized roles for the players, one of which in particular is
supported by the rules (the goalie, who can use her hands). Games are played for a
fixed amount of time and won on points. Generally considered the most popular
sport in the world.
Stickball*
A version of baseball adapted to fit local, generally urban environments. A broom
handle or stick is used in place of a bat, and the general rules of baseball are roughly
adhered to with exceptions made as needed.
Target Shooting*
A team or individual sport where participants attempt to shoot targets accurately.
There are many forms of this sport involving different types of weapons and targets.
Tennis*
A racket sport with two sides of either one or two players each, played on a court with
a net and a ball that can bounce. Players hit the ball back and forth across the net. Points

Crossword Puzzles*
An individual puzzle where the player attempts to fill in a grid of blank boxes with
words derived from information given in the form of indirect clue phrases.
Drawing Straws*
A traditional method for choosing a single individual from a group, for the purpose
of performing an unpleasant task. A number of long thin objects (e.g., pieces of straw),
all of the same length except for one shorter object, would be held in someone’s fist,
concealing their length. Each person would take an object; the person who “drew the
short straw” was the loser.
Drinking Games*
A large and varied family of games that revolve around drinking alcohol. Typically
some task is presented to the players in turn, and failure requires a player to drink.
Fantasy Sports (Rotisserie)*
Multiplayer games in which each player takes on the role of manager for a sports team.
A player selects the players for his team from a list, and games are resolved automatically according to some statistical rules (typically using data from real-world sports
matches involving the selected players). Most often the fantasy sport is played in a
season paralleling the real-world sports season. Originally a somewhat esoteric paperand-pencil pursuit, fantasy sports have reached enormous levels of popularity online.
Fear Factor*
A television game show in which contests are challenged to do things that many
people would find frightening or repulsive (eating insects, walking a tightrope, etc.).
Ghost*
A word game for two or more players. One player chooses the first letter. Each player
in turn chooses another letter until a player forms a word and loses, or forms a string
of letters from which no word can be made and is challenged (losing if she cannot
give a word beginning with that string).
Killer/Assassin*
A live-action game for many players usually played over the course of days or weeks.
Each player is given a target that she must eliminate from the game, typically by
shooting him with a squirt gun or similar toy weapon. A player may only shoot her
target or shoot in self-defense. If a player knocks another player out of the game she
inherits her victim’s target. The winner is the last player remaining.

Pari-mutuel Betting*
A form of betting commonly used for sports such as horse racing. All bets are pooled,
and payouts are determined by how much was bet on each racer. In other words, the
odds are not fixed at the beginning, but are determined by how the bets are placed—
the fewer people who bet on a given racer, the more that racer will pay out. It can be
thought of as a game that each bettor plays against all the other bettors.
Qualifier*
A tournament or race where the main purpose is not to pick a single winner, but rather
to pick a subgroup of players who will then go on to another tournament or race.
Participants typically only care about whether they make it into this subgroup (who
can be thought of as all equally “winning”), not how they place overall.
Raindrop Races*
A “zero-player game”: two raindrops roll down a windowpane. The first to reach the
bottom is declared the winner by the onlooker(s).
Rating Systems**
If a game has an organization devoted to furthering its play, that organization may
attempt to maintain ratings for the game: a system of numerical values, one for each
player (or team), that represent that player’s skill at the game.
The simplest form of rating system is point accumulation: each player receives a
certain number of points for a win (and sometimes some smaller number for a loss),
and the point totals accumulate. The disadvantage of such a system is that high player
ratings will tend to be due as much or more to frequency of play as to player skill.
More complex rating systems involve giving players points when they win, but
subtracting points when they lose. Such systems will produce more accurate measures
of player skill, but the occasional loss of rating points may discourage some players.
The best-known such rating system is the Elo system, invented by Arpad Elo for rating
chess players. In the Elo system, at the end of a match the winning player adds to her
rating the same number of points that the losing player subtracts from his. Additionally, this point amount is larger or smaller based on the expected outcome of the
matchup: beating a highly rated opponent will gain a player more points than beating
a low-ranked opponent. The Elo system is designed to be statistically predictive: given
any two player ratings, one may calculate the odds that the first player will beat the
second.
Slot Machines*
Single-player gambling games in which a player puts money into a machine, pulls a
lever or pushes a button, and several random symbols are generated. Different combinations of symbols have different payouts. Usually a player can choose to play dif-

Appendixes

299

ferent amounts in the same machine, and the larger amounts have a larger payout
and may open more combinations for payout. Some slot machines may be progressive:
having larger and larger payouts the more they are played without a payout, until
finally someone wins.
Survivor**
A television reality game show for sixteen to twenty players with a wilderness survival
theme, in which contestants undergo a series of challenges. After each round of challenges, one contestant is voted out of the game (“voted off the island”). Once there
are two contestants left, the vote is decided by previously eliminated players. The
object is to be the last person left.
Tournament Types*
For almost any game, one can hold a tournament: a series of matches of that game,
with one player (or team) declared the overall winner at the end. Individual matches
may be assigned by random pairings, on the basis of preexisting rankings (also called
seedings), or by some other system. There are many different styles, or formats, of
tournaments, among them:
Single elimination As soon as a player loses a match, he is out of the tournament. The
last player left is the overall winner.
Double elimination As soon as a player loses two matches, she is out of the tournament. The last player left is the overall winner.
Round robin All players play all others, with the player having the best record being
declared the winner (ties are broken by looking at the matchup results of the tying
players). Round robin tournaments work best with a small number of players.
Swiss After each round of matchups, players with the same record play each other
(e.g., players who have won four and lost one are matched against other 4–1 players).
The player(s) with the best overall record is/are declared the winner(s). Depending on
the details, Swiss may be equivalent to single or double elimination in terms of determining the overall winner.
Many tournaments are organized in a hybrid form—for example, Swiss or round robin
to determine a subset of eight, followed by single elimination among the top eight.
For some games, tournaments may happen over the course of one or two days; for
other games (particularly team sports), a tournament may take place over the course
of months (a season).
TV Game Shows*
A broad category of games designed specifically for spectation through television
broadcast. Contests can be individual or team-based, and contestants compete publicly

300

Chapter 8

for prizes through a wide variety of physical and mental means. Particularly common
are trivia contests packaged in varying rule sets and themes.
Twenty Questions*
One player thinks of something and the others try to guess what it is using twenty
yes-or-no questions.
Werewolf (Mafia)*
A game for a large group, typically eight or more. The two teams—werewolves and
townsfolk—are randomly determined ahead of time, with each player knowing only
his own designation. Every turn, the werewolves secretly choose a townsfolk to kill,
and then all the players (werewolves and townsfolk together) decide on one player to
kill. Killed players’ identities are revealed. The game ends when either all the werewolves or all the townsfolk are eliminated. Play revolves around the townsfolk figuring
out who the werewolves are, with the werewolves trying to conceal their identity. A
moderator is required (for coordinating the secret decisions), and generally there are
some players with special powers as well. Mafia is a version of the game with the same
rules but with an organized crime motif.
