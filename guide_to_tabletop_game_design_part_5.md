that playing an unfinished game isn’t a good use of their time. Another disadvantage I’ve
encountered is that sometimes it’s hard to get even an experienced game player to play a
prototype repeatedly. But, if you find someone who is willing to do so, hang onto them for
dear life! They are worth more than gold!
Another thing to keep in mind about experienced gamers is that often their knowledge comes
from playing other games. This is great if you are looking for comparative games for reference,
but they won’t always be able to “think outside the box” when it comes to offering feedback,
but that’s totally okay because we’ve already talked to our game designer friends about that.
Your goal for play testing with gamers is to find the answers for questions about comprehension and the play experience. We are looking for answers to questions like the following:
■■
■■
■■
■■

Do you understand how to play the game?
Did you enjoy playing the game?
Was there anything you found confusing or annoying?
Would you play this game again?

In Appendix A, “Resources,” you will find a play testing form that you can use to help guide
your play tests and get the answers you want from your play testers.
Your Game Isn’t Fun
One of the issues you are going to encounter during play testing is that players sometimes
(more often than you’d like) will not like your game. They will tell you, “I just didn’t think
your game was very fun.”
I hate the term fun. I hate it because it is too subjective of a term.
Fun is like funny or sexy—­everybody’s taste for what they consider to be fun can be wildly
different, even when it comes to board games. Plus, it’s often hard to get someone to effectively communicate what they think is fun. Fun is an emotion and often hard for someone to
quantify. It’s one of those “I’ll know it when I see it” situations, and that just isn’t very helpful
when it comes to determining what is wrong with your board game design.
That is why rather than trying to “find the fun” in your game design, you should concentrate
on the “unfun”—­the elements in your game design that are making your game not fun for
the players.
You see, unfun is much easier for players to spot. People, in general, are much more likely to
complain about something than compliment it. Problems are easier to spot than gameplay

CHAPTER 3

T he C hapte r A bo u t P lay T e s ti n g

that is working the way you want it to work. By concentrating on those problems, we can find
solutions and remove the “unfun” from the game, and what should be left, in theory,
is the fun.
Once we’ve identified a problem causing the unfun, we can address how to fix it. The following sections cover a few common problems found in game designs and provide some of the
ways they can be resolved.
YOUR GAME TAKES TOO LONG TO PL AY
As we will cover later, play time is one of the “three essentials”10 listed on a game’s box. As
such, it is important for a game designer to know how long it takes to play their game. New
game designers will often find that their game takes too long to play—­due to a variety of
reasons.11 There are several ways you can solve this problem.
■■

■■

Reduce the number of goals, objectives, or steps required to win the game: Try designing
your game with only one way to win. Play test it. See how long it takes to play your
game. Then add a second way to win, and so on. By working additively, you will have
more control over the systems in the game and how long it takes for the player to interact with them.
Start your game on “turn three”: I learned this trick from reading an interview with Klaus
Tauber, the designer of the wildly popular Catan (originally known as The Settlers of
Catan [1995]). He said in early play tests his play testers felt that the game took too
long to “get going,” but once it did, they really enjoyed playing the game. He thought
about cutting features from the game but realized that all he had to do was to start the
players with the equivalent resources that they would have on the third turn of the
game. This rectified the slow start to his game, and Catan has sold more than 32 million copies.
PL AYER S T HINK YOUR GAME IS “ TOO COMPLIC AT ED ”

Modern hobby games can get quite complicated. In our enthusiasm, it’s easy to add systems,
components, and mechanisms to our design. But as we’ve already discussed, a game that is
too complicated can be overwhelming for a player.

Don’t worry, we’ll be talking about the three essentials soon enough.
I don’t want to get onto my soapbox, but the hobby game industry has a real issue with confusing game length with
quality. If a game doesn’t take very long to play, the game is often dubbed by gaming enthusiasts as a filler game—­a
derisive term that implies that because the game is short in length, it is worthwhile only as a game that “fills the time”
between two longer (more worthwhile) games. This is ridiculous as a game needs to be only as long as it needs to be.
There are plenty of complex, elegant, lovely games that take 10–30 minutes to play as there are games that take 2, 4,
6, or more hours to play. One day, more of my fellow gamers will realize this. I’ll get off my soapbox now.

The solution? Concentrate on the good parts of the design.
Here’s an example: designer John D. Clair’s first game design was Edge of Darkness (2019), a
sprawling fantasy epic with many complicated mechanisms and systems. One of those
mechanisms was something he called card crafting, where players would slip clear cards into
sleeves to create new cards.
When publisher AEG first signed the design, they realized that Edge of Darkness in its current
form was too complicated, so they decided to focus solely on the novel card-­crafting mechanic
instead, which became the game Mystic Vale (2016).
YOUR GAME HA S A “RUNAWAY ” LE ADER PROBLEM
The runaway leader problem is when there is the possibility for a player to advance (score
more points, have more resources or money, be more powerful) than the other players to the
point where it is difficult or even impossible for the competing players to catch up, let alone
win the game. The other name for this is “the rich get richer” problem—­where players who
are successful keep earning money and resources while losing players are punished by losing
more money and resources.12
While there are those who claim that “winning doesn’t matter,” this as we know isn’t always
true. Remember, one of the social contracts a game designer makes with players is that “everyone should have a fair chance of winning the game.”
The runaway leader problem removes the fairness from the game, which will end up ruining
the game experience, no matter whether the player cares about winning or not.
It also discourages players from finishing playing the game as the other players see that there
is no chance that they can win. If players don’t complete a game, there is often little chance
that they will want to play it again. This can be especially disastrous for play testing—­when
you need play testers to iterate on your design. If they feel like they never have a chance to
win, why would they want to keep playing?
The solution to the runaway leader problem is rubber-­banding.13 These are systems or
handicaps added to your design to help losing players or “nerf” winning players during the
game. For example, some games limit the number of resources a player can have or the

Ironically, it was exactly this point that designer Elizabeth Magie was trying to make in her The Landlord’s Game
(1903). However, players of the 1920s and 1930s preferred winning money to being lectured at, which is how
Magie’s design became twisted into Monopoly (1935).
13
The term rubber-­banding originated in driving video games and refers to the handicapping that occurred when a
winning driver got too far ahead of the other drivers. Mechanics (like the infamous Blue Turtle Shell) would ensure
that the leader would return to the pack of racers to ensure a closer finish. Japanese publisher Nintendo patented
their rubber-­banding algorithm (US Patent 7278913) for the video game Mario Kart: Double Dash!! (2003).

number of resources physically included with the game. This means that if players want to
have access to more resources, they need to spend the resources they already have.
The worker placement game Agricola (2007) requires players to feed their workers at the end
of the turn, so while having more workers means you can collect more resources, you will
also have to spend those resources to feed your workers; otherwise, you will lose them. In
Power Grid (2004), the weakest player gets first choice of buying resources and placing cities.
In my research and experience, players will have a better time playing a game if it ends in a
close finish. The tension that the players feel when they all believe they have a shot at winning is a much better feeling to leave players with than a game in which they feel like they
have no chance at all for a victory.
YOUR GAME IS TOO PREDICTABLE , OR IS “ SOLVABLE”
A solvable game is a game in which there is a specific strategy that a player can use to win
every time. For example, while Connect Four (1974) has more than 4,531,985,219,092 possible moves, the reality is that there are only nine strategies that a player can use to play the
game.14 This means that once a player masters these strategies, the game becomes predictable and no longer fun.
To combat this predictability in your own game design, you want to introduce some variety
to your game. The best way to add variety is to make components modular. There are many
ways to do this. You can add decks of cards, multiple objectives, different paths on tech trees
or story lines, or endings/victory conditions.
For example, Catan has modular hex tiles that are shuffled and then laid out during setup.
This ensures that the island of Catan has a different layout each game. In my own game
design for ALIEN: Fate of the Nostromo (2021), I created a deck of player objectives (the number of objectives in play was based on the number of players) with more cards than the number of players. This ensured that there would always be a few extra cards that new players
wouldn’t see in the first playthrough so that the next time they played the game, they would
get some new and different objectives.
YOUR GAME HA S “ TOO MUCH LUCK”
This problem is a little more complicated. . .
“In my experience, there’s no such thing as luck.”
Obi-Wan Kenobi

These nine strategies were first discovered by Victor Allis in 1988. You can learn about them at www

WHY I HAT E LUCK
I don’t believe luck exists.
Let me clarify that. I don’t believe luck exists for a game designer. Let me explain.
Most players use the term luck incorrectly when describing a game. They will complain that a
game has “too much luck” in it. They feel that games with luck leads to unfair outcomes and
frustrating failures.
However, luck isn’t some magical force with control over our destiny. It is an emotional
response to success and failure. It’s dumb to say that board games have luck. Board games
don’t have emotions. It is impossible for a board game to have “luck.”
What a game can have is randomness, and randomness creates emotions in a player.
Randomness creates positive emotions (such as when you roll a 20 on a d20 in D&D—­
known as a critical hit) and negative emotions (when you fail to roll a saving throw during a
desperate situation such as a saving throw against your character dying). Anyone who complains about luck during a game is really complaining about uncertainty.
Uncertainty is when you’re not sure what the outcome of a dice roll or card draw or spinner
spin will be, but you hope it will be a good outcome, not a bad one.
Now, the reason why luck doesn’t exist for a game designer is that game designers have complete control over probability. Game designers can manipulate probability and its outcomes.
Manipulate probability? Now that sounds like magic! Let me teach you how to create
some “magic.”
Let’s say we are designing a fantasy adventure game. In our game, there are four rewards that
the player can earn.
■■
■■
■■
■■

A small bag of gold worth 10 gold pieces (gp)
A gem worth 100 gp
A shield (retail value 150 gp)
A magic sword that grants +2 to attacks (retail value 1000 gp)

CHAPTER 3

T he C hapte r A bo u t P lay T e s ti n g

In our game we will make players roll a 10-­sided die (d10) to determine which loot they get
after defeating an opponent. We want the small bag of gold to be the most common reward
and all other items to be rarer.
Write down what you think the distribution of the items should be here:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

_______________________
_______________________
_______________________
_______________________
_______________________

So, if I were filling out this chart, it would be like this:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

Shield
Shield
Bag of gold
Bag of gold
Bag of gold
Bag of gold
Gem
Gem
Gem
Magic sword

What’s my reasoning behind this distribution? I want the bag of gold to be the most earned
item, so I made it the most plentiful by putting it in the most slots, in this case four.
I wanted gems and shields to be less common than the bag of gold but more common than
the magic sword, so I used three slots for gems and two slots for shields—­with the thinking
that gems would be more useful to players than having two shields, so they would want to
get them more often.
Finally, I put the magic sword in only one slot because it is the rarest item.
If I wanted the gem to be rarer than the shield, I would have put the gem in two slots and put
the shield in three. Or if I wanted the gem to show up more often, I would have used four

69

70

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

slots of gems and four slots for the bag of gold with the shield and magic sword getting the
remaining two slots.
Just by playing with the number of opportunities the player gets to receive the reward, we
adjust the probability of that result appearing in the game. Pretty simple, right? Like I said
earlier: change a number, you change the experience.
Since this chart will appear in the game’s rule book, I took the opportunity to “play a trick” on
the reader. Notice how I placed the magic sword at “the end” of the chart—­in the #10 slot. I
did this because I wanted to make the player think that it was harder to get, so it required the
player to roll a higher number to obtain it.

But this is all a trick. I am totally playing mind games with the player! We’ll talk about dice
and probability in the next chapter, but for now, all you need to know is that a player has an
even chance to get any result when rolling one die. But because I placed the magic sword on
a number that the player perceives is harder to roll, it re-­enforces the concept that I am trying
to get across—­that the magic sword will be harder to get. Sneaky!
WHY SO R ANDOM?
There are other ways than just dice to create randomness. This includes card decks, tokens
drawn from a bag, a spinner, dexterity mechanisms, and more. But let’s talk about when the
randomness occurs during gameplay—­which is described in the concepts of input randomness and output randomness, which I learned about from game designer and podcaster Geoff Engelstein on the Ludology podcast.
According to Geoff, input randomness is when a random event happens before the player
gets to make a decision, such as the random distribution of tiles in Catan, shuffling the deck

CHAPTER 3

T he C hapte r A bo u t P lay T e s ti n g

of ticket cards in Ticket to Ride (2004) before laying them out in the market, or the rolling of
the resource dice in Wingspan (2019) before the player picks the resource type they want for
that turn.
Output randomness is when a random event occurs after you make a decision. An example
is when you make the decision to declare an attack in Dungeons and Dragons and then roll
combat dice to randomly determine whether you’ve hit or not. It is also the rule found in the
game Calimala (2017), which says that if you cannot take an action, you must draw from the
top card of the deck. Geoff goes on to say that gamers prefer input randomness to output
randomness because output randomness feels unfair and, well, random.

Let’s say we’re playing a fantasy adventure game and you’ve spent all your time and resources
to build up a character that can defeat just about any enemy in combat. When the time
comes to battle the enemy, you roll the die and get a critical failure (such as a 1 result on a
20-­sided die)! Of course, you are frustrated by this result because no matter what you’ve
done to prepare, a random result has foiled your plans.
While some players hate this unpredictability, other love it because it creates drama.
Speaking of drama, I realized that I’ve just opened a whole can of worms by talking about this
when I want to save it for a more in-­depth discussion in a future chapter. I hope you don’t
mind the suspense, but I want to finish our list of problems first. Here’s the last one. . .

YOUR GAME HA S A RULE OR ROLE T HAT IS “OVER-­P OWERED ” OR
“UNBAL ANCED ”
Game design is all about combining systems together in a planned way (that’s why it’s called
design), and one of the greatest challenges of game design is that there can be so many systems and mechanisms and variables that eventually a game designer is going to lose track of
how they work together.
It can be common for a game designer to lose track of how everything works together in a
game design. Sometimes the combinatorics15 of all your game’s systems and mechanisms
becomes too dense to keep track of, and this is what creates edge cases.
Edge cases are problems that occasionally arise during play testing but are harder to account
for why they are happening. Perhaps your play tester is an unusual thinker who found a way
to “break” your game. When this happens, it might be frustrating that this smarty-­pants has
broken your game, but you should be happy! This player has identified a problem that you
can fix. Game design is often about problem solving.
Another problem is when a rule or a role is considered by a player (usually the player negatively affected it!) to be over-­powered.
This is when the player (although it’s usually the other players) feel that the player has an
unfair advantage during the game. Again, most of the “problems” that we must solve with
game design are to make the game fair for everyone. The act of correcting this is known
as balance.
There are some game players who are obsessed with balance. You can find countless posts
online about how a game is “unbalanced” or “broken.” What they really mean is that the game
feels unfair.
Game designers can get obsessed with balance too. Often, they will save balancing a game
until after the first pass of the game is done. This is like that old filmmaker saying “We’ll fix it
in editing!” But I find this to be a mistake. You want to be aware of your game’s balance as
early as possible. The real trick is how to keep the game balanced as you are making it, but I
believe the answer lies in keeping the game fair for all players.
One of the reasons why game design is so hard is that no matter how much you try to balance your design, some game designs just don’t work. This is why you must be willing to
throw out that design before you’ve spent too much of your time and energy on it. Time and
energy are precious things, so use them wisely!
Combinatorics is a great word from the world of mathematics that is concerned with all of the arrangements or
configurations that something can be organized in.

WARNING! Don’t Literally Throw Out a Game Design or Prototype!
Here’s a true (and sad) story. Back in the early 1990s, I was really into collectible card games
like Magic the Gathering. I played every collectible card game (CCG) I could afford. Of course,
if you play enough games, you want to start making games. I had a bunch of blank business
cards and turned them into a Wild West–themed card game where you built a Western town
that would attract all manner of people based on the reputation of the town. If you had only
outhouses and mudholes, you would attract outlaws and riffraff. If you had hotels and saloons,
you would attract shootists and gamblers, etc. The game was playing well, and as I was deciding
what I should do next with the game, another Wild West–themed CCG came out, only this
one had the very clever mechanism of using poker hands to resolve combat. I was so mad at
myself for not making such an obvious connection that I threw my hand-­drawn prototype, the
rules, and everything about it into the trash! About three months later, I wondered why I had
done such a stupid thing and tried to reconstruct the game from memory to no avail! I still
haven’t been able to re-­create the game to this day. So, learn from my mistake! Never throw
out a prototype!

Friends and Family
Now you are ready to share your game with friends and family. While these might be the
easiest play testers for you to find and to play your game with, they aren’t always the most
helpful when it comes to solving problems.
Why?
Because your friends and family love you, they want to be supportive of your game design
efforts. They will compliment your game design and how clever and creative you are for making it! While this is great for your ego, it is not helpful when you are trying to find and fix
problems with your game design. If you have family members, like I do, who are good at helping you troubleshoot your design, then great, make sure to thank them in the credits!
Otherwise, friends and family are best utilized to help you determine whether a game is fun,
easy to understand, and that they are playing the game the way you want it to be played.
Friends and family can also be helpful when blind play testing.

Blind Play Testing
Blind play testing is when you give play testers your game with all the components needed
to play including the completed and clearly written rules so that they can play the game as if
you weren’t in the room with them. Blind play testing simulates what the customer’s experience will be. Since we game designers don’t come with the game, we must rely on our rules to
communicate the game.

NOTE

74

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

This can be hard because our first instinct is to try to help the player enjoy and understand
the game. You must resist this urge.
As a game designer, your job during blind play testing is to “shut up and observe.” Your goal
when play testing is to see you’ve properly communicated how to play the game through the
rules and the game play. Here are a few rules that I follow when conducting a blind play test:
■■

■■
■■

■■

Watch for players’ reactions. Note when they are having fun or laughing or when they
are confused or frustrated. Try to determine what is causing these reactions.
You should take notes when a player is having difficulty with the rules or the game play.
If possible, record the play session so you can review it more carefully after the
play session.
Do not answer questions from the play testers during the play test. The rule book
should be able to cover all questions. If it doesn’t, you have some rewriting to do!

Publisher Play Testing
The final type of play testing is playing the game for a publisher. There are some specific rules
that I follow when playing a game with a publisher for the first time. We will talk more about
this when we get to the chapter on pitching games. For now, I want you to keep these concepts in your head as we start to design our next game! Let’s go!

L e t ’s Ma ke a D ice Game!
LET US CONSIDER the humble die.
Dice have been around for a very long time. The little guy
shown here is one of the world’s oldest, dating all the way
back to 5,000 BC! It was found by archeologists as part of
an ancient Backgammon set, which means that if
Backgammon is from 5,000 BC, then dice are even older
than that!
The first “dice” were originally animal
knucklebones, from animals such as
goats, sheep, horses, and camels. These
astragalus were used for divination—­to
tell the future or answer a question. A
set of knucklebone dice were found in King Tutankhamun’s tomb. Eventually, the sides of
knucklebones were filed down into the square shape we are more familiar with.

Dice Basics
Dice are useful when it comes to designing board games. It’s one of the handiest tools in our
tool kit, so let’s get some dice basics out of the way.
First, it’s die for singular and dice for more than one. It is never dices. The dots on dice are
called pips, which means spot or speck.

76

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Dice are primarily used as random number generators to create a random result, such as
the number of monsters the player must fight, the outcome of combat with those monsters,
or the amount of a treasure the players gain for defeating said monsters.

For example, the dice in Wingspan (2019) generate resources in the form of food like fruit
and worms for birds, while in Zombie Dice (2010), they can generate delicious brains or shotgun blasts. There are dice with letters on them (Boggle, 1972), weapons (Age of War, 2014),
buildings (Alhambra the Dice Game, 2016), animals (Zooloretto: The Dice Game, 2012), or even
coffee beans (Viva Java: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game, 2014). When using these kinds of
custom dice in your game design, you’re limited only by your imagination and what you can
print or engrave on the dice. There’s only so much space on a die face!1
Dice are most often used to determine the distance a player can move. For example, in the
racing game Formula D (2008), each die represents a gear of your race car. The player starts by
rolling a four-­sided die and “shifts up” to the next highest gear by selecting the next highest
die, a six-­sided die. Players can go all the way up to a 30-­sided die, but they risk overshooting
turns and doing damage to their cars.
In Fortress America (1986), dice represent the strength of the attacking military unit. In many
fantasy battle games, like Dungeons and Dragons Basic Game (2004), the different polyhedral
dice represent the damage done by different weapons and spells.

1

The size of a standard die face is 16mm or two-­thirds of an inch.

CHAPTER 4

L et ’ s M ake a D ice G ame !

Dice come in a wide variety of shapes and
sizes such as the four-­sided die (or d4), six-­
sided die (d6), eight-­sided die (d8), ten-­sided
die (d10), twelve-­sided die (d12), and the
mighty twenty-­sided die (d20)! There are 30-­
sided die, 100-­sided die, and even a “2-­sided”
die. All these different shapes of dice are collectively known as polyhedral dice.
Dice don’t need to be polygons. Designer
dice are available in a variety of colors, materials, and even shapes. Manufacturer Tabletop
Tycoon’s range of dice resembles swords, shields, pouches,
arrows, and other fun shapes associated with the fantasy genre.
Most people associate the 20-­sided die with the role-­playing
game Dungeons and Dragons, but 20-­sided dice are much, much
older than that! The 20-­sided die shown here is almost as old as
that ancient six-­sided variety presented earlier in this chapter.
This 20-­sided die was crafted in Ptolemaic Egypt around 30
BCE to 300 BCE. It was carved from serpentine rock and
engraved with Greek letters. What game was it for? That is
a mystery!
Ten-­sided dice are known as a percentile die. When you roll two
of them together, they generate a percentage result with the
first number as the “tens” and the second number as the
“ones.” The range of results on two percentile dice is 01—­
which is 1 to 00, which stands for 100.

When rolling percentile dice, you’ll want to designate which die is the “tens” and which die is
the “ones.” A good way to differentiate them is to provide two different colored dice in your
game. Say a red die represents the tens die and a white one represents the ones die. That way,
when you roll a 00 and a 07, you’ll know whether you’ve rolled a 07 or 70. These two different
results could have a big difference!
You don’t need to be locked into the numbers shown on a die face; it is now possible and relatively inexpensive to create your own custom dice. This way you can play with the numbers
on the die to get different roll results.
The number of faces on the die doesn’t have to equal the number of results. For example, in
Formula D, the red fourth-­gear die, which is a d8, gives the results of 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, or 8.
You will notice that the designer removed the low number results (1, 2, 3) because you
wouldn’t drive that slowly in fourth gear. Making the die result start with 4 is more thematic
to represent the speed that the car is driving.
Another example is the dice used in the Star Wars X-­Wing Miniatures Game (2012). While the
dice in the game have eight sides, they have five different results: hit, critical hit, swerve,
focus, and blank. There is even a second die that is colored red that has less “positive” results
on them—­more blanks, less successful results.

Rolling
What do you do with dice? You roll them! Well, not all the time. But many board games from
Craps (1125) to Monopoly (1935) to Formula D (2008) use dice rolling as the main way to get
the action going. Rolling dice creates tension and drama in a game; the tumble of the dice
creates suspense as the players wait to see the result. This is particularly exciting when big
stakes are on the line.
If you have lots of dice to throw, you
could use a dice cup. This can be a simple plastic, cardboard, or metal cup. You
can print graphics on it like the cups in
games like Zombie Dice or Cthulhu Dice
(2010). It can be themed like the leather
cup found in Stone Age (2008). You can
even use it to hide the results like in
Liar’s Dice (1800).
If you want to get fancy, you might
want to use a dice tower—­which is a
cardboard or plastic tower in which dice
are tossed. Inside the dice tower are
slats or sticks that help make the dice
tumble as they fall, preventing nonrandom throws. Not only do they prevent
dice from falling off the table, but they
also look very cool sitting on your table.
I’ve seen dice towers that resemble castles, skyscrapers, churches, clocktowers,
and even leering skulls! Some games even incorporate dice towers into their gameplay such
as Shogun (1984).

Rerolling
What happens if you get a die result that
you don’t like? Well, in many games you
can reroll the dice! Farkle (1996), Yahtzee
(1956), and King of Tokyo (2011) all
allow you three chances to reroll the dice
to get different or better results. This
way, you don’t feel so restricted—­
it
gives you a choice whether to push
your luck or not by rerolling the results.
In these games, there are different strategic reasons why you would want to
reroll your results. In Farkle, you are trying to race to a predetermined number before the other players reach it. The larger the result,
the faster you’ll reach that goal and win.
In Yahtzee, you want to reroll as you try to complete combinations that allow you to earn
points. But as you complete more combinations, you’ll be forced to reroll to try to complete
the combinations you haven’t finished.
In King of Tokyo, you might want to reroll depending on the outcome you want to achieve—­
whether it’s causing damage to the player in Tokyo, healing your monster, or earning energy
cubes to purchase cards.
However, if you don’t get the results you want in a push-­your-­luck game, your turn is over,
and you usually lose all of the dice results that you’ve generated up to that point. This risk
versus reward gameplay that pushing-­your-­luck creates makes for exciting choices during the game.
In some games, rerolling is a benefit that can be earned,
bought, or unlocked by the player. This gives you control over
the results that you roll. Since the randomness of dice is an
aspect that some players find frustrating, giving them an
opportunity to mitigate that randomness is always welcome.
Just be judicious with how much the player can mitigate
that randomness—there can be too much of a good thing.
A game is more exciting when there the risk of loss is real,
but the reason for losing should be the fault of the player,
not because of the “dumb luck” that comes from the roll
of the dice.

Dice Determine Movement
Roll and move games, once the norm, are now mostly considered passé because they take
agency away from players. However, that doesn’t mean this mechanism is not worth using!
There are still excellent games that use dice for movement, such as Thunder Road (1987),
Merchant of Venus (1988), Deep Sea Adventure (2014), and Cubitos (2021).

Dice Determine Combat Results
Using dice for combat dates to 1824 when Georg Heinrich Rudolf Johann von Reisswitz Jr.
used them to determine damage in his father’s Kriegspeil (or wargame) design. Combat dice
found their way into mass-­market games through Risk (1959) and the hobby wargames of
the 1970s such as Wooden Ships and Iron Men (1974) and Squad Leader (1977). When Gygax
and Arneson introduced polyhedral dice in Dungeons and Dragons, board game designers followed suit.
Combat results occur either when players roll against a preprinted statistic (known as a
stat), which the player must roll “under” or “over” to succeed (as found in Axis and Allies
[1981] and Nexus Ops [2005]), or when two opponents roll dice and compare their results (as
in Descent: Journeys in the Dark (2015) or Star Wars: Outer Rim (2019).

Dice Placement
Players roll their dice and then determine
where to place the results. The results on the
dice give them options to where they can
place the dice to score.
For example, in Las Vegas (aka Vegas [2012]),
players roll several dice. Dice of the same
number must be placed on the corresponding
casino mats with that die number (2s go on
the 2 casino mat, 5s go on the 5 casino mat,
etc.), but the player has a choice of how many
dice they want to commit to that bid.
Conversely, in the game Sagrada (2017),
one player rolls the dice, and then each
player takes turns drafting dice to place
on their window. They also get to
choose where to place them in their
window as they attempt to earn the
best score.

Banking Dice
The player rolls a result and “locks it
in” to help toward a score or goal. Or

CHAPTER 4

L et ’ s M ake a D ice G ame !

that dice result can be used later in the game. The tension comes from the player having
less dice to roll on each consecutive turn as they attempt to reach their goal or improve
their score. Often, if an undesirable result is rolled or a “bust condition” occurs, the player’s turn is over.

In Favor of the Pharoah (2015), players must bank at least one die into their pyramid on their
turn to keep playing. Locked dice also allow players to buy cards that are worth victory points.
In Stuffed Fables (2018), a player may reserve a single die result to use for defense against an
attack or on a future turn.

Dice for Targeting
Dice for targeting is when you physically throw dice at a target (either on a playmat or printed
inside the box) to have it land on a symbol or icon. The number on the die usually represents
the damage the attack does to the target. In the game Dungeon Fighter (2011), you throw dice
at a target to get symbols to align with numbers to calculate damage done.
Using dice for targeting adds a physical dexterity component to your game play, which can
get chaotic, but that chaos can add fun to your game design.

Dice Builder
A dice builder is a game in which you collect or buy dice each turn. The dice are added into a
draw bag. On your turn, you randomly draw a predetermined number of dice from the bag to
be used on your turn. The dice are rolled, and the results are used for a variety of actions—­
buying more dice, combat, etc.
The game Quarriors (2011) was the first dice builder, which was inspired by the deck builder
mechanic found in card games. In Quarriors, all available dice are placed into a bag, and players randomly draw out dice. The results on the dice in Quarriors all have different probabilities and colors that correspond to powers and abilities, which the player may use, depending
on what is rolled. The Quarriors dice building system was popular enough to turn into several
licensed sequels, known as Dice Masters (2014).

Concealing Dice
Cups, bags, hands, screens, or other methods of concealment can be used to prevent a
player from seeing the types of dice or their faces. This allows for another layer of randomness when drawing dice. Games like Dice Masters, Sagrada, or Zombie Dice use a random draw
as another gameplay mechanism.

CHAPTER 4

L et ’ s M ake a D ice G ame !

Dice Determine Actions
The dice in Quarriors and many other games have
custom faces or icons that represent an action.
A sword icon indicates that the player could cause
damage, a magic wand indicates that the player could
use a spell card, and a winged foot indicates that the
player can move. These actions can be used only
when that die result is rolled.
Games such as War of the Rings: Second Edition (2010)
and Epic Tiny Galaxy (2015) use this mechanism, but
they also give players opportunities to mitigate (or
change) the die roll results into results that are more
favorable for the player.

Dice Determine Resources
Custom dice may also be used to allow
players to gather resources. It just
depends on what the icon on the die represents. In Bang: The Dice Game (2013),
they generate bullets, dynamite, arrows,
and beer, while in Istanbul: The Dice
Game (2017), the dice generate resources
such as textiles, jewelry, fruit, and
money. In the early 2010s these types of
dice adaptations of published board
games were very popular.
Other games such as Roll Camera: The
Filmmaking Board Game (2022) have you
roll dice to determine their resource;
then you can assign those resource dice
to locations on the board to fulfill the
location’s requirement. When designing
these types of dice, it helps to have one
of the sides count as a “wild” resource.
That way, players get two opportunities
to get the resource they need/want
when they roll the dice.

Dice of Different Colors
Because dice are produced in different colors, we can take advantage of this and create gameplay around the colors. In the game Qwixx (2012), there are six d6: one red, one blue, one
green, one yellow, and two white. The colors correspond to tracks on a score pad that the
players mark during play. You can use the number rolled on the white die only during another
player’s turns, but on your turn, you may use one white die and one colored die to mark on
the track of the corresponding color.
In the game Stuffed Fables (2018), different colored dice represent different actions the player
can take. Red dice perform melee attacks, while green dice perform ranged attacks. Yellow
dice allow players to search, while blue dice are used for special actions. Purple dice are wild
and can be used as any color.
Using colored dice is a great way to get custom results on dice roles without having to create
custom faces on your dice.

CHAPTER 4

L et ’ s M ake a D ice G ame !

Combination Matching
A variation on action and resource generation is using dice for combination matching. The
goal is to get a combination of results to activate an ability or complete an objective. In
the game God Dice (2008), players are trying to roll and reroll their attack dice to finish a
combination of dice to do more damage. If the player fails to roll a combination, there are
still “lesser” ways to do some damage. However, if the player fails to roll any sort of combination of dice that does damage, nothing happens. This type of gameplay works only
because the player has tokens of the different dice faces that can be spent to reroll dice of
that face.
In any dice game where the player is locked into the result rolled on the die, you want to
make sure that the player has some way to change the result. Rerolling is a good option, but
allowing the player to physically rotate the die to another face (like to the “opposite face” of
the die) or to a specific face (a sword icon becomes a shield icon) gives the player more control
over the random result.

Real-­Time Rolling
Players must roll the dice as quickly as possible to get the desired results before the timer
or music ends. If the player fails to roll the desired results within the time limit, they fail
the objective. This can be achieved with a sand timer as easily as with a CD or digital audio
file. Examples of this include Tenzi (2011), Escape: Curse of the Temple (2012), and
Fuse (2015).

Roll and Write
The game Yahtzee introduced the concept of the roll and write, where players roll dice and
then record their results on a preprinted score sheet. The score sheet in Yahtzee has different objectives for the player to fulfill—­such as scoring as many of one number as possible, or if all of the dice results are the same number, they score a high number of points.
(When the player rolls this, they must shout “Yahtzee!”) As the players fill up their score
sheet, they have fewer opportunities to record results, so careful allocation of results is
necessary to win.
After almost 50 years, the genre exploded in the early 2010s with titles such as Qwixx (2012),
Qwinto (2015), and Ganz schön clever (2018). Some newer or deluxe titles include an erasable
playboard to help players cut down on paper waste.

88

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

A variant of this mechanism that uses cards instead of dice is called draw and write (it’s
a pun on “drawing a card”), but there is also another variant called roll and draw where
the player draws in a picture or symbol onto the score sheet. Examples of this genre are
Saint Malo (2012) where you draw a city, and
Chroma Cubes (2014) where you color in sections of a paint-­by-­numbers picture depending
on what you roll. Welcome to DinoWorld (2017)
has players rolling and drawing a map of a
Jurassic theme park and the dinosaur exhibits
within. My own roll-­and-­draw design, Pizza
Cat (2021), has players drawing a newspaper
comic strip and scoring points based on the
elements drawn.
Another variation on the roll and draw is known
as crayon rail, where a player draws a line across
a map or score sheet to connect several locations
together. Most crayon rail games are themed to
trains and use cards or action points to determine where players draw rather than roll dice.

CHAPTER 4

Dice Stacking
In Sutakku (2011) and Tumble Town (2021), players physically stack dice on top of each other
to create structures and score points based on their relationship to each other. Often, the
higher the dice on the stack, the more points it is worth.
This type of play starts to move your dice game into the realm of a dexterity game, especially
if keeping the stack intact is part of the gameplay. We’ll talk more about dexterity games soon.

Dice Crafting
In 2011, Lego released the Heroica series of games: Fortaan, Waldurk, Draida, and Nathuz—­
which included “Lego dice” that were constructed by the player by snapping faces onto the
dice. The game Rattlebones (2014) showed up a few years later that used a similar conceit,
but, in this case, swapping faces on the die was part of the gameplay.
This new style of play was dubbed dice crafting. In a dice-­crafting game, players are trying
to create the statistically best dice, where every roll generates something useful to the
player—­much in the way that a deck builder starts with “junk” that must be weeded out over
play. Other dice-­crafting designs soon followed: Blank White Dice (2016), Dice Forge (2017),
KAPOW! (2021), and Dice Realms (2022). While these games offer great modularity, the constant removing and replacing of the dice faces can get somewhat tedious and can be difficult
to do for players with large hands or disabilities.

Dice as Counters
Dice can be used to track the health or status of something in a game. These can be used as a
replacement for counters or tokens that might end up taking too much room or are too many
pieces to deal with. They can be used to represent the number of something (a resource, the
power of a creature, etc.) without having to use lots of counters or tokens.

In card combat games such as Magic the Gathering (1993) and Yuh-­Gi-­Oh! Trading Card Game
(1999), dice are used to track life points—­where they are known as spin-­down dice. For example, players start the game with 20 health and rotate a d20 whenever they take damage. If the
dice is “spun” to zero, the player is out of the game. Other sized dice (such as d6) are often
used to represent the strength or number of a unit on the field.
Similarly, dice can be used as a cool-­down counter where the rotation of the dice represents the time it takes for something (such as a weapon, a machine, or a spell) to either cool
down or recharge so it may be used again by the player.

Dice as Units
This is where the dice represent what miniatures or meeples usually would. The value on the
dice face represents the strength of the unit. For example, if a die represents military troopers, a 4 would represent a four-­strength
army. It’s an easy way to have lots of units
represented without having to resort to
many components.
The face of the dice is rotated upward or
downward to indicate the worker’s status,
worth, health, etc. If the die reaches a “top”
or “bottom” value (like a 1 or a 6), then they
are considered used up and removed from
play or rerolled on the player’s next turn.
The game Quantum (2013) uses dice as
stand-­ins for spaceships, which is not as
exciting as miniatures but allows for ships
of various strengths to be cheaply represented. There are other games that use dice
as workers in a traditional worker placement game: Kingsburg (2007), Grand Austria Hotel
(2014), and Dice Hospital (2018).

Bluffing with Dice
Another popular use for dice is in bluffing games. This is a genre of game where the player
may lie to other players about their results. Liar’s Dice (1800) is a popular game that plays
much like the card game Poker (1810). To conceal their roll results, players use either a cup, a
screen, or their hand.

Pop-­O-­Matic
The “automatic cube shaker” was created
and patented2 for the game Trouble (1965)
to solve the problem of dice falling off the
table. To “roll” the dice, players press down
on a plastic dome, which in turn causes a
spring and a piece of tin to flex, tossing the
dice up and causing them to tumble, giving
random results.
On his podcast Ludology (found at ludol
ogy.libsyn.com/gametek-­2755-­
pop-­o-­matic), game designer Geoff
Englestein wondered if Pop-­O-­Matic produces truly random results. After a series of tests, he
determined that the standard Pop-­O-­Matic was just as random as rolling a die.
While Trouble would change publisher hands over the years, a handful of other games would
be made using the Pop-­O-­Matic system: Headache (1969), Side Track (1974), YIPES! (1983),
and Robo Force (1984). This device is still under patent, so not anyone can use it in their game
design without licensing it; I’m just including it in this list of mechanisms because it’s fun!

Choosing the Right Dice Tools
A multitude of tools are available for us to use. There is no right or wrong combination of
mechanisms as long as they work to make your game enjoyable. Which of these mechanisms
