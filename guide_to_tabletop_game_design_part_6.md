It’s Probably Due to Probability
Whew! That’s a lot of ways to use dice! Let’s examine the basic reason to use dice for gameplay: probability.

The patent for “dice agitating chance device” is US Patent #3,356,369.

An interesting fact about throwing a single die (in this case, a d6) is that it creates a flat
probability distribution. Your odds of getting a 1 result on a six-­sided die are just the same
as getting a 6 on a six-­sided die. If the meaning of that 6 result is better than the meaning of
that 1 result, the player will be much more excited when they throw that 6 result.
Here is where an interesting thing happens in the player’s perception. As a player makes
repeated throws of a single die, they might still believe that the “next time” will give them a
better result. This is known as the gambler’s fallacy. The player is pinning their hopes on
what the dice might do or not do, even though the probability says otherwise. As game
designers, we can manipulate that hope to get players to take risks and make actions they
might not otherwise make.
Please don’t interpret my use of the word manipulate as a bad thing; it is one of the more
powerful tools we have as game designers. The player must have hope to believe that they
will get a good result or their strategy will succeed or they will win the game; otherwise, they
might not play the game at all!
However, the numbers say otherwise. Let’s look at the odds realistically and learn how we
can manipulate them to create good and bad results for the player. By using a random number generator like dice—­or any randomizer for that matter—­a game designer is able to create
interesting choices and situations for the players.3
To determine probability, we can use the following formula:
Probability =

# of Desired Outcomes
# of Possible Outcomes

We’ve already started talking about this! Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten the “loot table” exercise from the previous chapter!

CHAPTER 4

L et ’ s M ake a D ice G ame !

I know, ugh, math. But rather than thinking of the outcomes as numbers, try thinking of
them as parts of a story.

Let’s pretend that we are playing a game where we are vampire hunters. What could we find
when we enter a crypt? What do we want to find? Go ahead and make a list.

Here’s what I wrote: a vampire, a werewolf, a coffin filled with dirt, a lingering mist, the bride
of Dracula, and nothing. The results could have been anything (in addition to finding a vampire, which is our main objective as vampire hunters). We’re limited only by our imagination
and how hard we want it to be for the players to get what they want.

93

94

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

How can we turn that into gameplay? Let’s put each of our results onto the roll of a die.
Finding a vampire can be a result of rolling a 1 on a six-­sided die. How many chances do we
have of finding a vampire?
Answer: _____________________________________
We have one chance in six, or a probability of one out of six, which is roughly 16 percent. Did
you get it right? There are six results, but only one of them is 1. Now what if we were to
change another face on that die to a 1, so the results are 1, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6?
Answer: ___________________________________
With this change, we now have two chances out of six to roll a 1 on our custom die. This is a
probability of two out of six, which is roughly 33 percent.
Different probability structures lead to different play experiences. We can keep
changing the number of 1s on our die until the player could find a vampire 100 percent of
the time, but how hard or interesting would that be? Not very.
As you can see, we change one number and the odds change. Depending on what the
results are, it will be easier or harder for the player to get what they want—­the desired outcome. If you are more inclined toward math, you can approach the design from the other way
around—­from the numbers first.

Let’s say we are digging for gold. How hard will it be for the player to find gold? If it’s easy,
then perhaps the player can find gold 50 percent of the time that they dig. Let’s create a die

CHAPTER 4

L et ’ s M ake a D ice G ame !

that represents this. In the template for a six-­sided die
shown here, go ahead and write “G” on the dice faces that
will result in gold and leave the other faces blank to represent “no gold.”
Since there are six faces on the dice, I hope you drew a “G”
on three of the faces. (It doesn’t really matter which face
you drew it on.) Out of the six chances, the player has three
chances to strike gold. That’s 3 out of 6, which is 50 percent.
OK, let’s make it harder for the player. Let’s say that the
player strikes gold only 16 percent of the time. It’s hard to
find gold here. Go ahead and write a “G” on the faces that
will result in gold and leave the other faces blank like before.
You should have drawn only one “G” on your die layout,
because 1 out of 6 is 16 percent (give or take). You don’t
even really need to be “good at math” to determine this.
You just need an idea of how easy or hard it is for something to be accomplished. If it’s hard, it happens less often. If it’s easy, it happens more often.
This is how you adjust the difficulty for your player.
Now, let’s add another d6 to this exercise and see how it changes the scenario.
When you have one die, the probability
curve is flat. You will always have a 1 in
whatever chance of getting a result
because a single die yields one result. If
a second die is added, it creates a bell
curve. You know, that thing that smart
kid in algebra class was always screwing
up for the rest of us.
The more dice you add, the “steeper” the curve
becomes, but it will still always be a curve. Go to the
website anydice.com and change the number of
dice to see this in action. What’s important is that
the range of numbers—­of possible outcomes—­will
help you to determine the probability range, or the
opportunity for success for the player.

Rolling the dice repeatedly can get boring for the player, especially if they don’t roll the
results that they want. We must give the player opportunities to mitigate their luck, in
other words, to be able to change the dice rolls to outcomes that are more favorable for them.

I Still Don’t Believe in Luck, But. . .
Let’s talk about luck again (aka “the odds of getting what we want”). But first let’s talk about
an interesting phenomenon when it comes to odds and a player’s perception of them.
In the folk dice game Bupkis,4 a player rolls six dice. They are trying to get a combination of
numbers. Some numbers and combinations are better than others, as shown in the following chart:
Bupkis Rules v1: A Dice Game for Two or More Players
■■

Roll six dice. You score based on the following results:
5 = 50 points
■■ 1 = 100 points
■■ Three of a kind = that number × 100
■■ Three pairs = 750 points
■■ Three 1s = 1,000 points
■■ A straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 1,500 points
■■ All dice of the same number = instant win!
The player who reaches 5000 points first wins.
■■

■■

Now Bupkis wouldn’t be very fun if on their turn the player rolled the dice only once and
received points based on the results. We want to give the player a choice. Choices are just
good for gameplay, especially if there is risk involved.
In Bupkis, you can risk all your points to earn even more points by rolling again. You get three
tries to reroll as many dice as you want, as long as you bank—­or set aside—­at least one scoring die. However, if you fail to reroll any scoring dice, you will lose all your accumulated
points for the turn.

It has been known by many names including The Dice Game, Zilch, Greed, 1000/5000/10000, and Farkle. It was first
commercially available as Bupkis in 1981 and as Farkle in 1996.

CHAPTER 4

Let’s adjust our rules to reflect this:
Bupkis Rules v2: A Dice Game for Two or More Players
■■

Roll six dice. You score based on the following results:
5 = 50 points
■■ 1 = 100 points
■■ Three of a kind = that number × 100
■■ Three pairs = 750 points
■■ Three 1’s = 1000 points
■■ A straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 1,500 points
■■ All dice of the same number = instant win!
On their turn, a player may reroll the dice up to two more times, provided they keep at
least one scoring die.
If you fail to roll a scoring die or combination, you lose all the points you’ve earned on
your turn.
The player who reaches 5,000 points first wins.
■■

■■

■■

■■

This type of risk-­taking gameplay is known as push your luck. The risk of losing everything
to win it all can be thrilling. This is why dice (and randomizers in general) are so great for
gameplay; they create drama!
Even if you’ve scored points from all the dice you’ve rolled, Bupkis creates even more drama
by allowing you to reroll all the dice to gain even more points! While at first this might seem
like a bad idea because you could lose hundreds of points, statistically it’s a better option
because the odds of rolling scoring dice and the combinations of dice you can roll are greater.

The greater the risk, the greater the reward.

With that in mind, here are the final rules for Bupkis:
Bupkis Rules v3: A Dice Game for Two or More Players
■■

Roll six dice. You score based on the following results:
5 = 50 points
■■ 1 = 100 points
■■ Three of a kind = that number × 100
■■ Three pairs = 750 points
■■ Three 1s = 1000 points
■■ A straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 1,500 points
■■ All dice of the same number = instant win!

■■

■■

On their turn, a player may reroll the dice up to two more times, provided they keep at
least one scoring die.
If the player has rolled all the dice and they all contribute to scoring, you may roll them
all again.
If you fail to roll a scoring die or combination, you lose all the points you’ve earned on
your turn.
The player who reaches 5,000 points first wins.

At its core, Bupkis is a race game. The player who reaches 5,000 points first wins the game.
Therefore, you want to earn as many points as you can as fast as you can.
That means taking a risk. That pressure to earn as many points as you can creates the excitement that makes Bupkis a great game. Here are a few good rules when creating risk in
your design:
■■
■■
■■
■■

Let the player know their odds before they take a risk.
Let the players decide when to take a risk and when to back down.
Give the player several opportunities to take risks.
Make the risk worth it; small or incremental rewards won’t do. Make the value of the
reward risked worth triple, quadruple, a hundred times more!

Let’s Design a Dice Game
We know about percentages, we know
about risk, and we know about rewards.
Let’s put all that knowledge to use! What
do we make? Which mechanisms do we
use? We have so many choices! It is
because there are so many choices that
game design can be so difficult.
Since we’ve been talking about push-­
your-­luck games like Bupkis and Farkle,
let’s design a push-­your-­luck game of our
own. First, let’s gather our components.
For our game, we will need the following:
■■
■■
■■

6 six-­sided dice
1 pencil with eraser
A few sheets of blank paper

CHAPTER 4

L et ’ s M ake a D ice G ame !

Now that we have all our components, let’s design a dice game.
In preparing to create a game, I suggest you research other existing game designs that use the
push-­your-­luck mechanism. One classic game that I found was about building a sequence
using three dice.
For our design, we’ll start with six dice instead (change a number). It’s perfectly fine to be
inspired by another game as a starting point, but your goal should be to create a different
game by the time you are finished with your design. We’ll have lots of opportunities to
change our design as we follow the steps for designing a game. These are the steps we
will follow:
Step 1: Create the rules.
Step 2: Play test the game.
Step 3: Change the rules.
Step 4: Change a number.
Step 5: Change the objective.
Step 6: Add a mechanism.
Step 7: Change the theme.

Step 1: Create the Rules
First, we need to come up with the rules for the game. I started with the concept (create a
number sequence) and the primary components (the six d6). Decisions that need to be made
about the rules included the following:
■■
■■
■■

How many times do players get to roll dice on their turn?
When is a player’s turn over?
What is the victory condition for the game?

Start by getting the answers to these questions (aka “the rules”) down on paper. You can and
undoubtably will be changing them later as you play test your design, but you have to start
somewhere. The following are possible starting rules for our sequence dice game:

Sequence Dice v1
1. Your goal is to create a sequence of numbers: 1-­2-­3-­4-­5-­6.
2. Roll all six dice.
3. You can accept your result, or you can choose to reroll any dice, even all six. You can
keep dice that are connected in a sequence. Any dice that do not connect must be
rerolled. (For example, you have a 3-­4-­5, but doubles or a 1 must be rerolled.) You
can choose not to reroll the dice and end your turn right here. See rule 6 for scoring.

99

100

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

4. Roll a second time. You may choose to reroll any dice, even all six.
5. Roll a third time and score the dice.
6. Score the dice you’ve kept in a sequence. Add the numbers on the dice face to determine your score. For example, 1-­2-­3-­4 equals 10 points. Write your score on
the paper.
7. If you ever roll a “natural” sequence of 1 through 6 in one roll, score 25 points, and
end your turn.
8. Play continues clockwise. The first player to reach 50 points or more wins.

Step 2: Play Test the Game
Play the sequence dice game using the rules we just created. Log your reaction to the
solo playtest.
How “fun” was this game for you? __________________________________
You’ll find that the first problem with this game design is that as the player, your decisions
are strictly guided by what you’ve rolled. For example, if a 2 and a 3 are rolled, then you will
start with that. If there is only one good choice, then there’s no choice.
Also, there is no risk or penalty for failing. You get to keep whatever you rolled without any
risk. You likely don’t really feel like you’re pushing your luck. Let’s change that. How do we do
that? We change the rules.

Step 3: Change the Rules
The rule change we can make to our game is to require the player to declare which way their
sequence is going—­up or down. If they roll any dice that doesn’t match the direction, they
lose them. That way, the player risks having less dice to roll on their next two rolls. Our
updated rules now look like this:

Sequence Dice v2
1. Your goal is to create a sequence of numbers: 1-­2-­3-­4-­5-­6.
2. Roll all six dice.
3. Once the player starts a sequence, they must announce whether the sequence is
running down (6-­5-­4-­3-­2-­1) or up (1-­2-­3-­4-­5-­6). Any dice roll that doesn’t fit that
direction is removed from play for that player’s turn.
4. You can keep dice that are connected in a sequence. Any dice that do not connect in
the chosen direction must be discarded. You can choose not to reroll the dice and
end your turn right here. See rule 7 for scoring.

CHAPTER 4

L et ’ s M ake a D ice G ame !

5. Roll a second time. You may choose to reroll any remaining dice.
6. Roll a third time and see if they help complete the sequence.
7. Score the dice you’ve kept in a sequence. Add the numbers on the dice face to determine your score. For example, 1-­2-­3-­4 equals 10 points. Write your score on
the paper.
8. If you ever roll a “natural” sequence in one roll, score 25 points, and end your turn.
9. Play continues clockwise. The first player to reach 50 points or more wins.
Even though it’s not in our list of steps, whenever we reach this point in the design of our
game, we should playtest again. That way, we can see if what we changed really made a difference. If it didn’t, we make a different change and try again (remember the iteration loop
from Chapter 3?).
We could change a different rule, such as what if the chain of numbers looped around so we
could have a chain of 5-­6-­1-­2? How would that change the gameplay?
When I added the loop: ____________________________________

Step 4: Change a Number
Here’s where we can start balancing rules or gameplay in our design. For example, we could
change the number of dice to five instead of six. Or we could change the number of points a
player must reach to win to 100 points instead of 50 points. Or we could adjust the number
of points a player earns for rolling a natural sequence from 25 points to 50 points.

Sequence Dice v3
1. Your goal is to create a sequence of numbers, for example, 1-­2-­3-­4-­5.
2. Roll all five dice.
3. Once the player starts a sequence, they must announce whether the sequence is
running down (5-­4-­3-­2-­1) or up (1-­2-­3-­4-­5). Any dice roll that doesn’t fit that direction is removed from play for that player’s turn.
4. You can keep dice that are connected in a sequence. Any dice that do not connect in
the chosen direction must be discarded. You can choose not to reroll the dice and
end your turn right here. See rule 7 for scoring.
5. Roll a second time. You may choose to reroll any remaining dice.
6. Roll a third time and see if they help complete the sequence.
7. Score the dice you’ve kept in a sequence. Add the number on the dice face to determine
your score. For example, 1-­2-­3-­4 equals 10 points. Write your score on the paper.
8. If you ever roll a “natural” sequence in one roll, score 25 points, and end your turn.
9. Play continues clockwise. The first player to reach 50 points or more wins.

Try playing around with each of these different changes. Track what happens when you try
each of them:
When I changed the number of dice: ____________________________________
When I changed the number of points: __________________________________
When I changed the reward for natural sequence: _________________________
Keeping a record of these types of changes in your design notebook will help you remember
all the changes you’ve made as well as help you in the future when you are designing
other games.

Step 5: Change the Objective
The objective of our sequence dice game is to earn points by creating a sequence, but what if
it were something else? Let’s try this. On their turn, players must roll duplicates of the same
number. How would changing the objective of the game change the game? How would
changing this objective change the scoring?
What if the objective of the game were changed completely from scoring points? What if
scoring was based on the number of duplicates you rolled? Let’s try this.

Matching Doubles Dice
1. Your goal is to roll doubles to score points.
2. Whenever you roll the dice, you can choose to keep them or reroll them. You may
reroll up to three times on your turn.
3. Whenever you roll duplicates, you earn 10 times the number you rolled on the dice.
For example, if you roll two 3s, you earn 100 points.
4. If you roll three of a kind, you earn 100 points, regardless of the number of the
dice face.
5. If you roll four of a kind, you get the total number times 100. For example, if you
roll four 4s, you earn 400 points.
6. If you roll five of a kind, you lose the number rolled times 100. For example, if you
roll five 3s, you lose 300 points.
7. If you roll six of a kind, you immediately win.
8. The first player who reaches 5,000 points wins!

Go ahead and play test this version of the game.
Did this change make the game better or worse? __________________________
Now it’s your turn. Write down a change to the objective that you would make and then play
test it and record the result.
My objective change is: _______________________________________________
The result of that change was: _________________________________________
Did that change make the game better or worse? _________________________

Step 6: Add a Mechanism
Here’s where things get really interesting. Right now, our game has rolling and rerolling
mechanisms, but let’s add something else. Look at the big list of mechanisms from earlier in
this chapter. Pick one to add to your game.
Once you’ve added this mechanism, be sure to play test it to make sure it is doing what you
want it to do and that the game plays the way you want it to play. If it doesn’t work, don’t be
discouraged; just try something else!
I’m adding: __________________________________________________

103

104

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

I’ve added dice as units to my matching dice game. Units need somewhere to go, so I’ve created a map (that you can copy or print out) on which you and the other players will place
their dice. Let’s see how the rules change with this new addition.

Payanonthean War
Components: Seven dice of matching but different colors for each player; print out or
re-­create the previous game map.
1. Your goal is to capture as many realms on the map as possible. The player with the
most realms conquered by having the most dice in them wins.
2. Give each player seven dice of matching colors (red, blue, green, or black).
3. You roll all seven dice on your turn. You may not reroll them.
4. Select dice of the same number and place them onto one territory on the map
matching the number in the territory; for example, all 2s rolled are placed in the “2”
territory of the map. You may place as few as one die and as many as all of them, as
long as they all have the same number.
5. The next player rolls their dice and places their matching dice on one of the
territories.
6. This continues until all players have rolled and placed their dice. You can place additional dice of the same number onto a territory.
7. Once all players have placed their dice, the player with the most dice in a territory
wins that territory. If there is a tie on a territory, no one wins that territory. The
player who controls the most territories wins the game.
That caused a severe change to our game design! You can see that just adding that one mechanism completely changed the type of game. This can be a blessing and a curse.
It’s a blessing because now your game design will be going in a direction that you didn’t quite
expect. Maybe this new game design is better than the original design you were working on.
(If you don’t like the new design, you can always revert to the older one.)
It’s a curse because now you’ve got to make a choice. Which design do you pursue? I’ve found
that it is easy to come up with new game design ideas, but what matters most is finishing
them. It’s too easy to get distracted by new, shiny game design ideas, especially when your
previous one isn’t going the way you want it to.

Step 7: Change the Theme
Many early dice games like Bupkis or Craps or Yahtzee are themeless. They are abstract
games that don’t have any sort of story genre to them. As more designers create games, they

CHAPTER 4

L et ’ s M ake a D ice G ame !

are putting themes onto games that were previously themeless. Some gamers complain that
themes are “slapped on” and don’t really add anything to the game other than making it
appealing to fans of that theme. However, other designers are designing dice games around
the theme. For example, the dice game Zombie Dice (2010) is themed to zombies and has
custom faces on the dice.
Steve Jackson Games, the publisher of Zombie Dice, has rethemed this game many times.
They’ve made Trophy Buck (2011), Dino Hunt Dice (2012), Mars Attacks: The Dice Game (2014),
and Batman: The Animated Series Dice Game (2016). Each time they’ve changed the theme,
they’ve also added one new mechanism to the game to make it a little different than the previous version.
You’ll notice that I’ve added a theme of a fantasy warfare to the revised previous example. Go
ahead and add your own theme to your dice game design. It can be anything you want! How
would it change your game? What new mechanism could you add to the game to make it
more thematic?
My dice game’s theme is: _____________________________________________
Adding a theme should impact your rules. Go ahead and write the rules to your new themed
dice game here:

Creating Your Own Custom Dice
Throughout this chapter, we’ve talked about custom dice. Not only is creating custom dice a
great way to assign your own probability and manipulate the statistics to fit your design, but
it’s also a great way to add theme into your game. You can create your own custom dice in
three ways.
■■

■■

■■

Modify an existing die. Using a marker, you can write on an existing die. Keep in
mind that this might be difficult to change. Some markers, such as Sharpies, leave a
permanent stain on the die’s plastic. You can buy blank die of all shapes and sizes
online that are ready to customize. However, drawing on a blank die face requires a
steady hand and good eyesight.
Stickers! I’ve found the best way to customize a die is to use stickers. You can use any
type of blank sticker to put on the face of your die. I use “name tag” stickers that you
can buy at a stationery or office supply store. I suggest either using a printer to print
what you want onto the sticker ahead of time or drawing on the sticker once you cut
and place the sticker onto the die. Be warned, cutting stickers and placing them onto a
die is a time-­consuming and somewhat tedious process—­especially if you have a lot of
custom dice to make. I recommend using either a very sharp pair of scissors or, even
better, a craft blade like an X-­acto knife to cut your stickers. Place the sticker onto the
die and then cut off the excess sticker, leaving only the face stickered. You don’t want
any bits of sticker hanging off the die as it might come off when you roll the die.
Manufacturing. If you have the means, you can either 3D print your own custom
die5 or have a manufacturing company do it for you. Be aware that many of these companies require a minimum order, which can get quite expensive and leave you with
more dice than you want. The minimum number of dice most of these manufacturers
make is 100—­which is a lot of dice, especially if you need only a dozen or so for your
game design! However, they can be a great solution if you are publishing your own
game. I’ll list a few of these dice manufacturers in the appendix of this book.

Dice Games to Play
Congratulations! You have designed a dice game! But just because we’ve designed one game
doesn’t mean we should stop learning. And the best way to learn is to play more games! Here
is a list of dice games that I like and you should try:

Formula D (2008)—­This thrilling racing game has one of the best uses of polyhedral
dice I’ve ever seen (at least since Dungeons and Dragons!). While roll and move is considered passé by modern designers, this is proof that this mechanism is still
worth playing.
Qwixx (2012)—­This simple roll-­and-­write game offers a lot of tough choices, and every
player gets to play on every turn.
Las Vegas (aka Vegas) (2012)—­Players roll and assign dice as they try to collect the
most cash.
Roll Player (2016)—­This game was first described to me as “rolling up D&D characters
but without ever going on the adventure!” The design is quite novel and has many different characters, which gives it a lot of replay ability.
Unearth (2017)—­Players are archeologists who roll and assign dice to unlock locations
for points and gain special abilities.
Sagrada (2017)—­This competitive dice game combines dice rolling with the puzzle
game Sudoku.

L e t ’s Ma ke a C ard Game!
IN THE MOVIE industry, it is believed that the best way for a young director to get their
start is to make a horror movie. Look it up: James Cameron, Francis Ford Coppola, Sam
Raimi, J.J. Abrams, Peter Jackson, Zack Snyder, Guillermo Del Toro, and Ridley Scott all got
their start in Hollywood making horror movies.

Compared to most other genres, horror movies are quick to make, they are accessible for
independent creators, they give creators a chance to experiment, and they often make a big
splash for less effort than other types of film. The audience will always go see a new horror
film even though there are thousands of them out there to enjoy.

I believe that card games are the horror movies of the tabletop industry. Card games are inexpensive and quick to make, and yet they can make a big impact. Card games allow designers
to experiment or to create a new twist on a classic formula. Before we make our own ground-­
breaking card game, you should first learn how to make a card.

Let’s Create a Card!
To make a card game, first you need to make some cards. There are several ways to do this
depending on the time and effort you want to put into it.

One Way to Make Cards
The first way to make cards is to take a standard letter-­sized sheet of paper (8.5" × 11" or A4
sized if you live overseas) and use a pencil and a ruler to draw two sets of lines on it like this:

Then cut along the lines with scissors until you have nine cards. You can write whatever you
want to on these cards, except. . .
. . .to be honest, these kinds of cards aren’t very good.
Sure, you could play a game with them, but you will be able to see right through them, so any
information that you want to keep secret from other players is revealed. They fold or bend or
tear easily if you aren’t careful handling them, and they don’t shuffle very well at all. The best
thing about these kinds of cards is that they are easy to change and throw away if a card
becomes obsolete during the prototyping stage.

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

Let’s toss those out and let’s make better cards.

Another Way to Make Cards
Okay, don’t really toss out your cards. You can
use them to make cards that are easier to shuffle and handle. For this, you are going to need
what are called penny sleeves. Penny sleeves are
clear plastic sleeves that you use to protect
cards, like Magic the Gathering or Pokemon
cards. They are inexpensive, and thanks to the
popularity of tabletop games, they are easy to
find both online and in stores.
Go ahead and slide your paper card into the
penny sleeve. The sleeve provides a little more
stiffness and rigidity to your card. You can even upgrade your cards using a higher-­quality/
cost sleeve, such as those made by companies like Dragon Shield or Ultra-­Pro.
If you do a search online for “collectible card sleeve,” you can find these slightly stiffer, more
durable card sleeves. You can also purchase these types of card sleeves with opaque backs.
These are useful when you want to distinguish different types of decks from each other.
You can also buy card sleeves with images of your favorite characters, fantasy creatures, and
intellectual properties printed on them. At this stage of making a prototype, I suggest staying away from these as I find the images to be distracting, but your tastes may vary. Do what
makes you happy.

Make sure you avoid using the hard plastic sleeves (also known as top loaders). These are
often used to protect collectible/high value cards. Just like with paper cards, these stiff
sleeves make it hard to shuffle cards. They also take up a lot of storage space. Unless your
game needs to use something like this, I would avoid these as well.

Yet Another Way to Make a Card
The sleeved cards are pretty good and provide better support than floppy paper cards, but I
can find that they still are a bit floppy to shuffle and handle. This is where you want to add
some stiffness by adding a “core” in the form of another card.
You can find a deck of standard playing cards almost
anywhere—­especially at big-­box stores, drug stores,
and liquor stores—­and they are almost always very
inexpensive. Or if you live near a board game store,
you could ask the owner if they have any free “common” cards lying about. These are “worthless” cards
from games like MTG or Yu-­Gui-­Oh! that represent
land, common creatures, and spells. The board game
store I live near has boxes of these cards that they
would happily give away to anyone who wanted them.
Take one of these “worthless” cards and slide it in between your cut card and the sleeve. This
way, the image of your card faces outward, and there is a card “stiffener” in the middle.1 This
will give your card the right amount of stiffness, which makes it easier to shuffle and handle
during gameplay. Plus, it’s more durable than just a paper card!

Here’s One More Way to Make a Card
There’s a fourth way to make a card. There’s a “quick and dirty” way to make cards. Take one
of these playing cards or “common” collectible card game (known as CCGs) cards and take a
Sharpie marker and just draw right on it.
This is easier to do with standard playing cards as there is usually more blank space in their
design. Voilà! You now have a card that you can shuffle and handle. They aren’t pretty, but it
does the trick.
Another good quick and dirty method is to place a sticker over the face of a playing card and
draw right on that. Or you can print out the information on the sticker and place it right
onto the face of the card.
My friend and game designer James Ernest has a great tutorial video on making these types of cards that can be
found at www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0t6PBypahI&t.

Even More Ways to Make a Card
Another way to make cards is to use index cards. They are bigger than standard playing cards,
but they are quick to make and even come in different colors if your game requires the cards
to have some sort of differentiation.
You can also take comic book backing boards (you can buy, or sometimes get for free, at your
friendly neighborhood comic store) and hand-­cut these into card-­size cards. I find that they
are stiffer than regular cards and a little harder to shuffle, but you can’t see through them,
and ink doesn’t bleed through the paper, which can happen with standard printer paper.
If you have the means, you can also buy blank playing cards on Amazon or at online game
printers such as Print and Play or Game Crafters. I’ve even seen blank cards that can be written on with a dry-­erase marker and erased if you want to make a change.
One thing I don’t recommend doing is using Post-­it Notes as cards. They are way too flimsy,
and you can’t shuffle them. Another thing I don’t recommend doing is laminating your cards.
It’s expensive to do (if you don’t own a laminating tool), and it’s impossible to change your
card once you’ve laminated it.2

Print and Play
If you have access to a design software program (such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator or
GIMP) and a printer, I suggest you print your own cards. Many times, I will skip all the methods I outlined earlier and make my own cards on the computer. It might seem like more
work, but there are several benefits to creating your cards digitally.
First, it is easier to re-­create your cards. Imagine making a deck of 52 unique cards, play testing them, and wanting to make another deck to have a friend play test. Making a new deck by
hand is going to take forever! It’s much easier to reprint your deck. Or even better, send the
digital file of your deck to your friend. They can then make a copy of your game by simply
printing. Doing this is known as a print-­and-­play game. Making print-­and-­play files of
your game is often necessary when pitching a game to a publisher. Print and play also makes
it easy to share your game with the rest of the world! We’ll talk more about how to do
this later.
When you print your own card, make sure to print them on cardstock. Cardstock weight is
traditionally measured pounds with 67lb–110lb range being the average weight used.
However, it is often measured in grams per square meter (gsm). This is the universal measure

There are exceptions to every rule. If you are making a card game where you must draw on the card with an erasable
ink marker, then go ahead and laminate away!

for playing card paper weight. The higher the number (300gsm, 330gsm, 350gsm), the
thicker and heavier the stock and card will be. Heavier cardstock gives your cards a higher-­
quality feel.

You will need the following tools to create cards:
■■

■■

■■

Scissors, which are best for cutting standard paper or cardstock.
A craft blade, which is used for cutting standard paper.
A self-­
healing cutting mat, unless you don’t mind leaving knife marks in
your tabletop.
A metal ruler. I don’t know about you, but I can’t cut a straight line with a craft blade
to save my life. You will need one of these to keep your card edges straight.
A paper trimmer. A cutting device that uses a razor blade on a guiderail to cut
straight lines. I prefer this to the craft blade/metal ruler method.
Guillotine trimmer. If you have the space in your workshop, this is what I recommend using. However, make sure you are careful when cutting; you don’t want to lose
any fingers!
Color printer. There are so many different makes and models out there, you should
pick the one that is best for your budget. I recommend getting one with a built-­in scanner that can handle heavier stocks like card stock and linen cardstock.

Speaking of linen cardstock, this is a paper with a textured
feel that is pleasing to the player. Linen paper has two distinctly different sides. One side is smooth like regular paper,
and the other is textured. When printing your cards, make
sure that your images are printed on the textured side. With
linen cards, generally a back and a front of the card are glued
together to make one card.
Sometimes another thin sheet called a core is glued in
between the two. This is to ensure the card’s stiffness but to
also make it impossible to see through the card to see the
information on the other side.

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

Once you’ve printed your cards, don’t forget to round the corners using a rounding tool.
This is a cutting tool that makes the edges of a card round and easier to shuffle and handle.
You’d be surprised what a big difference this simple step makes.

Size Matters
Using the right card size is important for your
game. Fortunately, there are a variety of templates
available online at sites like Print and Play (www
.printplaygames.com/prototypes/
formatting-­guidelines/card-­formatting-­
templates) and The Game Crafter (help.the
g a m e c r a f t e r . c o m / a r t i c l e / 3 9 -­
templates). I suggest using either a single-­card template or a nine-­card layout.
You’ll notice that on these sites, there are a variety of sizes of cards. It can be confusing at
first, but I find it helps to know the difference between them so that way you use the right
size card for your game.

Poker cards are the standard size for playing cards. They are 2.5" × 3.5".
Euro Poker cards are slightly smaller (2.48" × 3.46") than standard Poker cards and
are often measured in millimeters (63mm x 88mm).
Bridge cards are also smaller than Poker cards (2.25" × 3.5") because to play the game
of Bridge, you need to hold more cards in your hand. A smaller card makes the hand of
cards easier to hold.
Mini cards are also known as mini Euro cards because they became popular in
Eurogames like El Grande (1995) and Ticket to Ride (2004). They are very small (1.75"
× 2.5") and are best used if you don’t have too much text or information on them.
Tarot-­sized cards are oversized (2.75″ × 4.75″) and work especially well for components such as character cards, event cards, or game finale cards. Their larger size differentiates them from “regular” cards and helps make their content seem important.
They work especially well in games like Dixit (2013) and PARKS (2019) when showing
off beautiful artwork.

There are other size cards, but you’ll find the ones I listed are the most common and useful.
However, if you are looking to create something original, there are a variety of unusual cards
that you can use in your design. Keep in mind that these kinds of cards require more effort to
create. These include clear cards, pentagonal and hexagonal cards, and circular cards.

Clear Cards
Gloom (2005) was the first card game that I played with clear cards. In the game, you overlay cards on top of each other to “improve” or “diminish” the original card. Game designer
John D. Clair has published several games that use clear cards. In his designs, he uses both
sleeves and clear cards so that the cards combine to create new cards with different abilities. Games such as Mystic Vale (2016), Edge of Darkness (2019), and Dead Reckoning
(2021) use this “card crafting” mechanism in their designs. Canvas (2021) and 3000
Scoundrels (2022) use a similar card-­crafting mechanism, but the result creates a new card
image as well.
Even less common are cards with openings cut into them that allows the player to see
through them or to other cards underneath. These can be somewhat challenging to

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

­ anufacture and are prone to damage during play. Turing Machine (2022) players decode
m
messages with die-­cut cards.

Pentagonal and Hexagonal Cards
Using pentagonal or hexagonal cards is not that common.
Not only does Hecatomb (2005) use hexagonal-­shaped
cards, but the cards have clear edges so you can overlap
them to create different card effects. The problem with
these usual-­shaped cards is that the pointy edges of the
cards often get bent.

Circular Cards
Round playing cards have been around since the 15th century, but they’ve never quite caught on. I wonder why that
is. Are they too hard to hold? Or maybe you just can’t tell
which way is up? The reason is lost to the pages of history.
Speaking of history, let’s take a moment to explore the history of card games.

A Very Short History of Card Games
It is believed that cards were first invented sometime during the Tang Dynasty (618–907
AD) in China. Several literary references refer to emperors and ministers playing a game
called yezi ge, or “the game of leaves.” However, game historian and author David Parlett3
argues that yezi might just be the word for cards. Exactly what games were played using
those cards are unknown.

Money cards became popular in China in the 15th century. These skinny cards were used to
play ma diao (three-­legged horse), a complicated trick-­taking game. These games spread
through trade routes through India, Persia, Arabia, and Egypt, eventually finding their way to
medieval Europe in 1400 AD. These early card decks were originally hand-­painted and only for
the rich, but with the advent of woodblock printing, cards became cheaper and more popular.

Parlett’s fascinating research and article about yezi ge can be read at www.parlettgames.uk/histocs/

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

The standard card deck’s modern suits evolved originally from Mamluk card decks, which in
turn became the card game Tarocchi, which was renamed Tarot by the French. The most
famous of these Tarot decks is the Waite-­Smith deck, which features art by Pamela Coleman
Smith.4 Over time the imagery of the Tarot deck changed: swords became spades, pentacles
became diamonds, cups became hearts.
With the popularity, portability, and affordability of cards, a variety of games were created.
Karnoffel, the oldest trick-­taking game, is still played in Germany. Dozens of new games were
created using a standard card deck. This includes games such as Maw, Reversi, Skat, Gleek,
Canasta, Old Maid, and Go Fish. Edmund Hoyle became the ultimate authority on card
games when he wrote his Treatise on Whist in 1742. In the mid-­1700s, the solo game Solitaire
emerged possibly from fortune telling. In 1875, the Joker first appears as a trump card in the
game Euchre. Old favorites eventually evolved over time: Whist became Bridge, Poque became
Poker, Conquian became Gin Rummy.
Many of these card games become associated with gambling (also known as gaming), and the
entire gaming industry emerged. Cities around the world such as Monaco, Macau, Atlantic
City, and Las Vegas became meccas for gamblers and gaming.
Images return to card games with Authors (1861), Snap (1905), and Memory (1966). These
games are aimed at children and families rather than gamblers, but by the early 1990s, card
game manufacturers have found a new way to get money from their players.

The collectible card game (CCG) debuted with Richard Garfield’s Magic the Gathering (1993).
Published by Wizards of the Coast (WotC), they have become a multibillion-­dollar franchise.
Players have bought and opened millions of booster packs as they attempt to find rare and
valuable cards. Spurred on by WotC’s success, dozens of CCGs have been published:
Shadowfist (1995), Star Wars CCG (1995), and Legend of the Five Rings (1995) are just a few.
Hoping to shake off some of the negative aspects of CCGs, the genre has evolved into the
“Living Card Game” (LCG) with Android: Netrunner (2012), Lord of the Rings LCG (2011),
and Game of Thrones: The Card Game 2E (2015).

Another twist on card games came with Donald X. Vaccarino’s Dominion (2008), which
invented the deck-­building genre. A flood of these deck-­builder games followed in the wake
of Dominion’s Spiel Des Jahre win including Thunderstone (2008), Legendary: A Marvel Deck
Building Game (2012), Star Realms (2014), and dozens of others.
Fueled by the Internet, thanks to the increase in small-­press printing companies and bolstered by crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indigogo, card games experienced a renais-

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

sance. Games like Apples to Apples (1999), Werewolves of Millers Hollow (2001), Cards
Against Humanity (2011), Exploding Kittens (2015), and Unstable Unicorns (2019) reached
worldwide audiences and have made millions of dollars in the process.
And that brings us back to today! Will your game be the next to leave its mark on history?
Who knows? You’ll have to make it first!

An Order of Sides
To make a card game, let’s look at all the mechanisms that exist that can be used to create
gameplay. But first, let me ask you a question:
Q: How many usable spaces do you think a card has?
A: 
If you answered “two,” you’d technically be correct; but if you are thinking like a game designer,
you’ll realize there are twelve usable spaces! Think about how the card in your game is used
during the game, both while in the player’s hand and on the table. This is what makes cards so
flexible and desirable for game designers. Let’s look at all the locations available on a card:

Upper-­left corner: This is where a player looks first when holding/reading a card.
This location is where you can find the name of the card (as in Magic the Gathering and
Pokemon Trading Card Game [1996]), its affiliation (as in the Star Trek Collectible Card
Game [1994] and Star Wars Customizable Card Game [1995]), its type (as in
