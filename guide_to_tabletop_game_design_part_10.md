don’t show artwork of a little house on a space where a little house isn’t meant to go. If
the player sees a little house, then they will assume this is where a little house is
meant to go.

Drawing a candy card is great fun for a young child when it works in their favor, but get ready to hear them howl
when they end up moving backward and away from the finish line! However, don’t deprive these young gamers of
this valuable lesson about playing games—­things don’t always go the way you want them to.

Victory Tracks
The victory track is separate from the racetrack. It is often found going around the perimeter of the game board, or it can be on its own board entirely. It is used to track the player’s
scores during the game. Sometimes a victory track might have icons that award players certain benefits (like card draw or additional resources) as they move around it.
If a player reaches a certain point on the victory track, it might trigger an end game as in
Ark Nova (2022). In some games, a player might earn so many points that the player’s token
“laps” the victory track. To solve this, you can create a second track that moves every time
one of the big numbers (usually 50 or 100) is reached.
The Quacks of Quedlinburg (2018) gives you a “50 token” that indicates that you have
reached the end of the track, but the token keeps going. The player just adds 50 to whatever their score is at the end of the game.

Maps
Designers have been using maps to represent play spaces on a board since the early 1800s.
It’s true! Some of these earliest printed board games were also maps because their creators
were printers of maps. Early games like Walker’s Tour of France (1815), The Traveler’s Tour
through the United States (1822), and the Royal Geographical Amusement or the Safe and
Expeditious Traveler Through all the Parts of Europe by Sea and by Land (1823) doubled as geographic maps for those who preferred to travel from the safety of their parlors.
It doesn’t matter if the map is of a planet such as Earth like Pandemic (2008) or Mars like
Terraforming Mars (2016) or of a planet in another galaxy like Dune (1979) or Alien Frontiers
(2010). The map can be set in a country like in Ticket to Ride (2004), Fury of Dracula (1987),
and Power Grid (2004) or in a city either real like Scotland Yard (1983) and Tokyo Sidekick
(2018) or imaginary like in Lords of Waterdeep (2012) or Townsfolk Tussle (2022).
Basing your game board on a pre-­existing map is not only a quick way to start a design, but it
easily establishes your game’s theme and location. Real features such as borders, roads, or
rivers can act as the spaces and lines of travel for your players.

Terrain
Terrain can be used to add flavor, variety, or realism to the spaces on your map. These
diverse locations can help or hinder a player’s travel or define where they can and cannot go.
Traditionally, here are what some of the more common terrain types do:
■■
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■
■■

■■

Mountains slow down player movement or block it completely.
Cities and towns are places where players can gain or buy resources such as money,
cards, or additional workers. They might be where players need to return to after a
quest or objective to “cash it in” for money or points.
Desert, tundra, and ice plains are used to slow down player movement or limit
resources.
Water (such as lakes or oceans) often blocks a player’s movement completely,
unless they have a ship, plane, or some other alternative form of travel.
Plains/grasslands are usually “safe” locations where players can place their pieces,
find, or grow resources or move unhindered.
Fields are often bountiful locations, perfect for finding or growing resources.
Forests, jungles, and swamps can slow player’s movement, but they are also often
where encounters with hostiles such as wild animals, monsters, or bandits happen.
Volcano/lava fields/thorns prevent players’ movement unless they want to sustain damage.

You can use different colors on your map to distinguish different terrain types. I recommend
using an icon or artwork in addition to color in case the player is color blind. Having a legend
on the map or on a player guide (as well as in the rule book) can cut down the time the players need to take to determine the effects of the terrain on gameplay.
Terrain is especially impressive when it is three-­dimensional! The toy-­like nature of three-­
dimensional terrain creates what is known as good table presence. Have you even been at
a gaming convention and walk by someone playing a particularly cool-­looking game? Notice

CHAPTER 7

L e t ’ s M a k e a B oard G am e

how your attention snaps to it, you can’t take your eyes off it, and you want to immediately
know what the game is? That’s good table presence! That’s a desirable thing for a game design
to have. Here are a few games, in my humble opinion, that have great table presence:

■■

Heroscape Master Set: Rise of the Valkyrie (2004)—­Dragons, Army Men and Valkyries
battling on 3D modular terrain? Fantastic!

Dark Tower (1981)—­If you were an 80s kid, you couldn’t resist the lure of this massive
black tower. It was so cool; they remade the game as Return to Dark Tower (2022).

Bosk (2019)—­Recently, tree-­themed games such as Everdell (2018) and Photosynthesis
(2017) have become quite popular, (but this grove of autumnal trees is very pleasing.

CHAPTER 7

L e t ’ s M a k e a B oard G am e

The Shivers (2023)—­The pop-­up play space in The Shivers isn’t just innovative; it’s lovely
to look at and explore with fantastic illustrative artwork.

You don’t need to have pop-­up terrain or cool miniatures to create great table presence. Some
game boards (and their components) are just plain beautiful to behold such as Ian O’ Toole’s
porcelain plate design of Lisboa (2017), Villo Farkas’ minute city and stage details in
Trickerion: Legends of Illusion (2015), Sandara Tang’s charmingly illustrated dragon town of
Flamecraft (2022), and Michael Menzel’s cutaway view of the French palace of Rococo (2013).
But you don’t even need beautiful illustrations to make an impression. Many of the abstract
games we’ll be talking about have a beautiful simplicity all their own.

Abstraction and Symbolism

To paraphrase the artist Rene Magritte, this game board is not a place, but it is a symbol of a
place. Even thematic games can be abstractions of a place like Tokyo being simplified as two
large circles King of Tokyo (2011) or the eastern coastline of Japan represented as a line in
Tokaido (2012). These are not realistic maps of actual places but more like the idea of a place.

Detail from Tokaido

Game boards may also be illustrative as if they were pages taken from a storybook, as in
Islebound (2016), Feudum (2017), and Septima (2023). The works of designer Jerry Hawthorne
in Mice and Mystics (2012), Stuffed Fables (2018), and Familiar Tales (2022) use the pages of a
storybook as gameplay maps.
When designing a game board, a decision that game designers must ask themselves is, “How
abstract do I want/need my game to be?” The answer depends on the type of game the
designer wants to create. The less symbolic a game is, the more of a simulation it is, while the
less realistic a game is, the more symbolic it can be. Let’s look at three different games and
how their different levels of representation and abstraction affect their gameplay and visual design.

Railways of the World (detail)

CHAPTER 7

L e t ’ s M a k e a B oard G am e

In Railways of the World (2009), the player’s goal is to connect cities with tracks—­which is
common to all three of our games. However, Railsways features realistic maps of the Eastern
US seaboard (and Mexico). Players are concerned with building railroad tracks across the
map as well as moving their detailed little plastic trains to the connected cities. Railway’s
simulation goes moderately deep where players are concerned with upgrading their trains,
earning income, taking out bonds for extra income, and transporting goods. The player with
the most money wins.

Ticket to Ride (detail)
Ticket to Ride (2004) has gameplay that is more abstract than Railways. In Ticket to Ride, players are also concerned with connecting cities across an accurately represented map of America
(and other countries in later versions) using their supply of little plastic trains. Ticket doesn’t
concern itself with upgrades, transporting goods, or money for that matter. The trains are
almost a metaphor for the intercontinental network of rails.

TRAINS (detail)
Finally, there is Trains (2012). The map of Tokyo is a “blob” of hexagons that don’t really try
to match the topography of the city. Train cards, which are “bought” by the player, are represented by cubes on the game board. However, the trains are never moved, and the players
aren’t even trying to create routes on the board! Out of the three, it is the most abstract of
all. Because we aren’t concerned with the minute details such as transporting goods or where
the tracks go, the design of the game can be more abstract—­giving the impression of the
theme, rather than slavishly adhering to it.
All three of these examples are fine train-­themed games. You can see how the level of abstraction helps determine the level of detail the game requires during play.
A board’s two primary functions are to provide a play space for all the players and to communicate the gameplay to the players. The following are the key things to remember when
designing a game board:
■■
■■
■■

■■

Areas of play must be clearly marked.
Plenty of room should be allowed for the components to “fit on” the space on the board.
“Negative space” should be created between the elements on the board so that players
can visually differentiate the spaces on the board.
Text on the board should be large enough for players to see and read from across
the table.

How to Make a Game Board
Whenever I start a prototype for a board game, I invariably must start by making the board.
The first boards that you make probably won’t be great, but with some patience and practice,
you’ll be able to make a great-­looking prototype board! These are the tools and supplies you
might need to make one:

■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

Poster board, hot or cold press (like Bristol) illustration board, or foam-­core board
Clear tape
Scissors
Ruler
Craft knife (like an Xacto blade)
Colored pens and/or colored pencils
Graphics program (optional)
Color printer (optional)

Let’s start making that board. Here are a few lessons that I’ve learned when it comes to creating a physical board for a prototype:
■■

■■

■■

■■

You can hand draw your board to start, but while it’s faster, unless you have some talent as an artist, it will be very rough. It doesn’t need to be anything fancy at the initial
stage, but as you get closer to a prototype you’ll want to share, you should make it look
as professional as possible. Straight lines and clearly written text go a long way.
I prefer to create my game board first in a computer graphics program such as Adobe
Photoshop or Illustrator. It’s faster and easier to change a digital gameboard.
When you have finished your board, print it onto paper. You might have to print it
onto several sheets and then trim and fit them together like a puzzle.
Glue your printed sheets onto a heavier, stiffer material like poster board, hot or cold
press illustration board, or foam-­core board.

You can assemble your board just by taping the sheets of printed paper together, but it
tends to rip and will be destroyed if someone spills their drink on it.
I don’t recommend making your game board out of “brown” cardboard. It easily creases
and don’t look very aesthetically pleasing.
Just like with playing cards, I don’t recommend laminating as you will likely make
frequent changes to your game board.
If you want to make a dual-­layered board, use a craft knife to cut out the top layer and
then glue that onto another layer of board. Make sure your craft blade is always sharp
and replace them often.
If you want to spend the money, you can also create your board digitally and then send
it out to be printed at a printing service like Print and Play (printplaygames
.com) or the Game Crafter (thegamecrafter.com). I find that there’s nothing
sharper looking than a professionally printed board!

Understanding Abstract Games
There are technically two classifications of board games: representational and abstract.
Representational (or the term I prefer, thematic) is when there is a strong pretense, theme,
or story—­as in Monopoly with buying property in Atlantic City, New Jersey, or in Blood Rage
with angry Vikings fighting Ragnarök.
In contrast, an abstract game design concentrates solely on the game’s most basic element
such as a core mechanism. There is no need to have a story or theme to distract from the
pleasure one gains from the simplicity of an abstract game.
Some players feel that a game that concentrates only on mechanics can be “dry” and that a
game needs a theme to make it engaging or enjoyable. Some abstract games attempt to solve
this concern by adding on a theme after the game has been designed. This can lead to the
criticism that the theme feels “pasted on” and has nothing to do with the gameplay.
There are some games that walk the line, with Chess being the perfect example. Chess is considered a classic abstract game, but I believe it to be a thematic game. In Chess, there is a
hierarchy to the pieces that is represented by their rank and ability. This hierarchy never
changes no matter how the game is represented even when its form or theme is changed.

CHAPTER 7

L e t ’ s M a k e a B oard G am e

I own a Batman chess set where the two kings are Batman and the Joker, and the two queens
are Catwoman and Harley Quinn. The king and queen pieces could have been any character
from the Batman universe, but of course the lead characters must be the most important
pieces.14 This, to me, indicates that theme is very important to the game of Chess and
wouldn’t be the same game without it.
.

We will be talking about thematic games a lot in the Chapters 8 and 9. For now, we will dive
into abstract games!

I would argue that Batman is more appropriate as a queen piece based on that piece’s power and flexibility in
the game.

Traits of an Abstract Game
An abstract game is also known as a combinatorial game. The word combinatorial is sometimes used to distinguish it from games with randomness or hidden information. Abstract
games are often considered “themeless” games because they are focused primarily on the
game’s mechanisms without the artifice of story or premise. Other traits used to distinguish
an abstract game include the following:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Minimal number of components—­Most abstract games have a low number of
components. Everything is used during gameplay without any additional frivolities
such as victory point tokens or resource cubes.
Efficient components—­The components themselves are simple as well but are also
used efficiently. For example, look how much information is packed onto a standard
playing card deck. Fifty-­two cards. Thirteen cards of a particular suit. Four cards of
each rank. Twenty-­six cards in each color. A card on its own has three levels of information: suit, rank, and color. They can be read upside down. They can be lined up in
rows and columns. It is this efficiency that allows for so many games to be played
with them.
Minimal rules—­You shouldn’t have to look up the rules during play. The game
should be easy to teach orally. As your game doesn’t have much backstory or thematic
setup to explain, it should be quick to learn.
Minimal goals—­Game theorist Christian “Mindsports” Freeling says there are only
two types of abstract games: ones that “eliminate the heart” (as in capturing the king in
Chess) and ones that “eliminate the body and limbs (as in capturing the most pieces in
Mancala or moving all of your pieces to the end as in Backgammon).
Little to no board setup—­The depth of the game comes from the strategy, not the
number of spaces/pieces that can fit on the board.
Player count—­Many abstract games are for only two players. Obviously, this isn’t a
hard and fast rule as there are plenty of games that can accommodate more than
two players.
Little downtime—­
Downtime is generally regarded as a bad thing in a game.
Downtime is when players are not doing anything, usually on another player’s turn.
Giving the players simple, clear choices that are fast to execute is a good way to
reduce downtime.
Deep strategy—­As the box of the abstract game Othello says, “a minute to learn, a
lifetime to master.” It isn’t a puzzle to be “solved” after a few plays. You enjoy learning
the strategy and tactics with repeat plays. Strive to create emergence for the player to
keep the game interesting. They find that emergence elegant, fascinating, and even
beautiful.
No “luck”— ­Everything is visible to the players. There is little to no hidden information. In Checkers, everything is precisely what it appears to be on the board. You take

CHAPTER 7

■■

L e t ’ s M a k e a B oard G am e

alternating turns with your opponent, attempting to eliminate their pieces. The most
strategic player wins, not due to good or bad chance.
Lacks a theme—­The game and its components are vague. The game doesn’t try to
simulate a narrative. Names, when used, are used to help the player remember what
pieces do.

The Concept of Elegance
There are some abstract games that are so well designed that their players refer to them as
“elegant.” It sounds like a goal that you would want to achieve with your design, doesn’t it? I
mean, who doesn’t want to have their work considered elegant? But what exactly does it
mean to be an elegant game?
A simple definition is “an elegant game is one in which you can do a lot of stuff without too
much stuff.” A game with a simple rule set, efficient turn actions and limited components.
There are few other concepts that promote elegance in a game as well such as the following:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Affordances—­Let the components help explain the rules. Use physical attributes
and graphic design techniques such as color, shape, and size to suggest what the components do and how players can use them. When applicable, match colors, shapes, and
sizes on the board to help players understand where things can be placed or played.
Change—­The game state must change as a direct result of the player’s actions. The
player must be able to predict what change will happen when their opponent takes an
action too. However, the game must have enough depth so that the player cannot
“solve” the game by predicting how it will end.
Depth—­W hen talking about elegance, players often refer to a game being “deep” in
contrast to it being “simple.” Depth often correlates to the number of possible interactions between components or the number of choices a player can make compared to a
simple game, which offers only a few and can lead to a game feeling repetitive or boring.
Interconnectivity—­Players love to discover connections between rules and actions.
They enjoy being able to do or achieve something more complex in a way that is as
simple as possible. They get excited by combinations and making chain reactions happen, such as jumping multiple pieces in Checkers.
Complexity—­There is often the notion that an elegant game must be simple. But
that isn’t the case. Instead, you must design the game so that the gameplay becomes
exponentially more interesting as you ratchet up the complexity. Players can learn
more complex ideas as they play the game; just don’t start the game by trying to explain
all of them.
Balance—­Despite players loving big moves, they also admire a game that is balanced.
By this I mean a game that doesn’t feel weighted in one player’s favor more than
another. There aren’t exceptions to the rules. Players often start off on equal footing.
At the end of the game, the player’s scores should not be wildly apart from each other,
like a score of 3 to 25 points. Ouch.

With all these ideas in mind, let’s look at the mechanisms that can be used to design an
abstract board game!

Abstract Game Mechanisms
As we know, mechanisms are the tools that a game designer has when creating gameplay. The
following are several game mechanisms used in designing an abstract game:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Alignment/connection—­You must connect a certain number of pieces in a row,
pattern, column, or square to score points or win the game. Games that use this mechanism include Tic Tac Toe (–1300), Connect Four (1974), Tantrix (1991), Qwirkle (2006),
and Quantic (2019).
Configuration game—­You must create special, predetermined shapes or patterns to
complete objectives or score points. Creating these configurations can be found in
games such as Dragon Castle (2017), Azul (2017), Tiny Town (2019), and Holi: Festival of
Colors (2020).
Capture—­You must maneuver your pieces to either land on or surround a piece or
space to win the game. Examples include Chess (1475), Martian Chess (1995), GIPF
(1996), Onitama (2014), and Hive (2000).
Territory games—­You place pieces onto a board as you try to either block off
areas—­or territories—­so an opponent cannot access it as you try to control areas for
points or as a victory condition. Often, these games use tetrominoes and resemble the
video game Tetris. Blokus (2000), FITS (2009), Cathedral (1978), and NMBR 9 (2017)
are examples of tetromino-­style game.
Pushing them off—­Your goal is to push an opponent’s piece off the board to either
remove them from play or score points. Games like Abalone (1987), Shobu (2019), Baby
Boom (2010), and Scram! (2023) use this mechanism.
Return—­You can return “lost pieces” back into play. Strategy might require purposely
losing a piece early in the game to have it return for use later. You can find this in The
Royal Game of Ur (–2600), Trouble (1965), GIPF (1996), and War Chest (2018)
Movement—­Your design can feature pieces with specific or unique movement. These
pieces can move a predetermined number of spaces, or a number determined by a randomizer (such as pieces in Senet). The movement can be based on a pattern (such as
the “L” shape of the Knight in chess). Movement can be orthogonal or diagonal or a
combination of both. Your rules can restrict movement – as in that you can never
move a piece backward or diagonally—unless you want the player to, or a special circumstance arises (such as “kinging” a piece in Checkers).
Race/destination—­You are trying to get a single piece or several pieces to a destination, usually at the opposite side of the board. Games like Onitama (2014), Camelot
(2015), Quoridor (1997), and Squadro (2018) have this as scoring or victory conditions.
Pylos (1986) has players trying to get their piece to the top of a stack to win.

L e t ’ s M a k e a B oard G am e

Restricted placement—­You play with specific rules that prevent players from just
playing any old piece wherever they want. This can be color, shape, number, or some
other restriction that makes the game more challenging as the game progresses. You
can find this escalation of challenge in games such as Sagrada (2016) and Spots (2022).
Route-­building/connection—­You place component pieces to create a path and
route on the board. Completion of this route or meeting the victory condition leads to
completing objectives, earning points, or winning the game. Quoridor (1997), PÜNCT
(2005), Hex (1942), and Tak (2017) are all abstract games that use this mechanism.
Stacking—­You stack components onto other components to block, score points, gain
dominance, or achieve a victory condition. This can also be reductively where stacks
are reduced over the course of the game. There are even games where the stacks fluctuate over the course of play. The stacks can be the components themselves or block
other components that are nestled inside of them. Examples of this include “kingmaking” in Checkers (1150), the capstones like Tak (2017) and Santorini (2016), reducing
stacks in Battle Sheep (2010), and towers that “grow” and “shrink” in Die wandelnden
Türme (2022).
Flipping tokens—­You flip or rotate components to give new abilities or functions.
In both Reversi (1883) and Othello (1971), tokens are flipped to either their white or
black side to indicate their allegiances. In Tortuga (2007), turtle pieces are flipped to
“neutralize” their movement. In Fearsome Floors (2003), flipped tokens change the distance the character can move on a turn. Sometimes these tokens may be used only by
a single player, in other cases, they may be a shared pool of tokens between all players as in Quarto (1991) or Scram! (2023).
Elimination games—­You work to be the last player standing usually through eliminating the opponent’s pieces. Chaturanga (550) paved the way for many other games
over the ages including Feudal (1967), Tiny Towns (2019), and Tsuro (2005).
Mancala games—­You move components around a board in either a clockwise or
counterclockwise fashion as they are deposited onto spaces for later collection. Named
after the ancient game of Mancala, this mechanism has more recently shown up in the
designs of Dead Pan (1956), Swahili (1968), Trajan (2011), Five Tribes (2014), Planes
(2014), A Fistful of Meeples (2019), and Ostia (2022).

These mechanisms are excellent for strategy games, but there is another kind of abstract
game: word games.

Word Game Mechanisms
While we discussed word games in the chapter about card games (Chapter 5), there is a type
of word game that is played on a board. Just like with their card game cousins, word game
players must spell words to score points or as part of the victory condition. Boards are used
partially for thematic reasons and partially to help the players organize the game’s tiles or

221

222

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

cards. They might also help guide players to how long of a word they may spell or might provide bonuses in conjunction with points on a tile, as seen in Scrabble (1931).

Scrabble (detail)
According to Tony Augarde, the author of the Oxford A–Z of Word Games, word games have
appeared in every period of history, in every part of the world. The oldest recorded word
game is a riddle found in Babylonian school texts.
Several card and tile word games were published in the 19th and early 20th centuries such as
Hangman (1894) and Anagrams (1910) and later games like Scoralet (1936), Anex-­A-­Gram
(1938), and Questo (1939) provided blank grid boards for the players to lay their cards
or tiles on.
It wasn’t until Scrabble15 (1948) where the board became an important component to the
gameplay with its spaces that doubled and tripled the scoring of letters and words. After the
success of Scrabble, word games became a staple of board games. They have their own unique
set of gameplay mechanisms and objectives.

Forming words—­Players spell words using components (usually tiles or cards) that
have a single or several letters printed on them. Words can be short or long. Some
games (Quiddler, 1998) require words to be of a predesignated length. Often words
must be longer than a single letter, and in many games, proper nouns or words in
other languages (than native to the players) are not allowed.
Restrictions—­Some word game rules enforce restrictions on the players to make the
game more challenging and fun. For example, in Boggle (1972), players can use a letter
only once. In Tapple (2012), players can use words only in a specific order or starting
with a specific letter. Wordsy (2017) makes players share letters from a pool. Other
games create restrictions such as you can only overlap letters on an already existing
word (Letterbox, 1977) or the word must already contain letters from an already played
or constructed word (Bananagrams, 2006, and Upwords, 1982).
Substitution—­If a word can be created or transformed by substituting letters—­such
as changing the word CAT into RAT—­that’s known as the Levenshtein Distance.16
This formula is the basis for the iterative word game Wordle: The Party Game (2022).
Muddle—­W hen letters are muddled or scrambled in some manner, words tend to
become obfuscated to the player. Pulling tiles from a draw bag or drawing cards from a
deck is a good way to muddle letters. Words that are purposely muddled by the designer
are called an anagram. Letter Jam (2019) is a good example of a game that
uses anagrams.
Distribution—­W hen creating a word game, you want to make sure that you have
enough letters to allow the player to spell out plenty of words. For example, you should
have several vowels (a, e, i, o, and u), but you don’t need very many y’s because it’s less
common in the English language. For Scrabble, inventor Alfred Butts scoured the
New York Times newspaper to see what the frequency of each letter of the alphabet
was. He then used that frequency to determine how many of each letter he should
include in his game and their point value based on rarity.
Placement—­Found primarily in tile-­based spelling games, this is when the location
where the tile is placed on the board can give you a scoring bonus, complete an objective, or give you an advantage such as drawing an additional tile.
Guessing—­These are word games that have players create or read a word from a prewritten card. Other players must then guess what the word is from clues. Games using
this guessing mechanism are varied from Hangman (1894) to Probe (1964) to A Little
Wordy (2021).
Theme—­The theme of the game influences the words that can be spelled or how they
are spelled. For example, in the fantasy-­themed Paperback Adventures: Damsel (2022), a

“critical hit” can be scored against enemies if all the letters in your hand are played on
a single turn. In the Lovecraftian-­themed game Unspeakable Words (2007), the more
angles that appear in the words spelled, the greater their mystical value, but they also
sap your sanity!
Just because I’ve classified these mechanisms as native to word games doesn’t mean you
can’t combine them with any of the other mechanisms we’ve talked about in this book. You
can create some extremely original games this way. Now that we have all the knowledge and
tools to design an abstract game, let’s (finally!) make one.

Let’s Design an Abstract Game
We are going to design an abstract strategy game that uses the following mechanisms:
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

Placement
Movement
Pushing them off
Territory control
Shared components

First, the components will be needed. Let’s start with some tokens. We are going to need 32
of them, and they should look like this:

We want them to be flat disc-­like tokens about 1.75″ (4.5 cm) wide. They should be made
from a blank material so we can write on them or place a sticker on top of them. They can be
cardboard, wood, or plastic. You will be picking them up and setting them down frequently in
this game, so they should be somewhat thick and not fold when handled. You can find these
kinds of tokens either online or at an arts and crafts store.
Set aside nine of the tokens and paint them completely black. Spray paint or a Sharpie pen
works fine for this. Paint the remaining 23 tokens white.

CHAPTER 7

L e t ’ s M a k e a B oard G am e

On the white tokens draw or painting the following symbols. Alternatively, you can draw or
print the shapes onto sticker paper. The symbols can then be cut out and placed on the tokens.
A straight line with an arrowhead at one end (five of these)

An “L” shape with arrowheads on both ends (four of these)

A straight line with a “double arrowhead” at one end (three of these)

An “L” shape with “double arrowheads” on both ends (two of these)

A “T” shape with arrowheads on all ends (three of these)

A “T” shape with double arrowheads on all ends (two of these)

225

A “cross” shape with arrowheads on all ends (two of these)

A “cross” shape with double arrowheads on all ends (two of these)

Finally, you will want to create a 10″ × 10″ game board. While you can use a sheet of paper, if
you want it to last, I suggest using poster or illustration board. On the board, draw a 7×7 grid
like what is shown in Figure 7.1.

Figure 7.1 Initial game grid

Color the squares in your grid red, blue, purple, and yellow as indicated in Figure 7.2. There
are also white squares. It might be a little tricky, since the illustrations is in gray tones, but
the letters should help you determine the colors.

It’s so mysterious! By the way, this game is called SCRAM! You’ll understand why in a moment
as we build out the game in the following steps.

Step 1: Create the Rules
The first step we need to do to make our game playable is to explain the setup and create
the rules.
Setup
1. Place the board in the center of the table.
2. Each player selects a color on the board: red, yellow, blue, or purple.
3. If there are two players, select five black tokens, if there are three players, select seven
black tokens, and if there are four players, select all nine black tokens.
4. Place the remaining (if any) black tokens aside. They are not used during the game.
5. Put the remaining black tokens with the white tokens into a common pile.
The Rules of Scram!
1. The first player places one token of their choice onto the board. The token can be
rotated in any direction.
2. When a token is placed, pay attention to the direction of the arrows. Any adjacent
token being “pointed at” by the arrow is affected when the token is placed.
3. Tokens with single arrowhead move an affected token one space in the indicated direction. Double arrowheads move the affected token two spaces in the indicated direc-

tion. A token must be adjacent to be affected by the arrows. For example, if Chris plays a
double arrowhead token, it does not affect tokens that are two spaces away.
If a token collides with another adjacent token while being pushed, it will push the
adjacent token as well that number of spaces. This can cause large chain reactions
across the board, so be careful where you play your tokens!
The second player selects and places one token of their choice onto the board. If a
token is affected by the arrow on a white token, move the adjacent token accordingly.
If a token is at the edge of the board and is knocked off the board (“scram’d”), then it is
removed from play. A “scram’d” token may not be used again during play.
Continue placing tokens until all the tokens have been placed, at which time the
game ends.
Calculate victory points. White squares are considered “neutral” spaces and do not
score. Players get one point for each white token on the player’s color. Players get three
points for each black token on the player’s color. The player with the most victory
points wins the game!
In the case of a tie, the player with the most black tokens on their color wins.

Step 2: Playtest the Game
You are now ready to playtest the game. Try playtesting it with different numbers of players.
Remember to ask your playtesters questions about what they liked and didn’t like about
playing the game. Record the responses here.
When I playtested the game with two players:
______________________________________________________________________
When I playtested the game with three players:
______________________________________________________________________
When I playtested the game with four players:
______________________________________________________________________
Also, pay attention to how long it takes to play the game. Abstract games usually shouldn’t
take longer than 15–30 minutes to play. If it takes your playtesters longer to play, observe
why that happened and write down some ideas on how to make the game in less time.
Play time (2 players):
______________________________________________________________________

Play time (4 players):

Step 3: Change the Rules
Next, change a rule. Where do we have the flexibility to change gameplay? Is it how the
pieces move? Is it how the players select tokens? What if the players started the game with
their own pool of tokens rather than drawing from a shared pool?
My rule change is:
__________________________________________________________________
Go ahead and write down your new rules here. Notice how one change might affect the rest
of the gameplay.

Once you’ve playtested that change, record the results here.
When I playtested the game with my new rule change:
__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________

Step 4: Change a Number
What numbers do we have to change? The number of tokens. What if there were fewer black
tokens or more black tokens? What if there were no white squares? What if the number of
colored squares were different? What if there were fewer groupings of colored squares? Go
ahead and change a number.
My number change is:
__________________________________________________________________
Once you’ve playtested that change, record the results here.
When I playtested the game with my new number change:
_________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________

Step 5: Change the Objective
Change the objective of the game. What if the objective is to be the first to push all the black
pieces off the board? What if it is to get as many black tokens as possible on the squares of
your color? What if it is to score the least points?
My objective change is:
________________________________________________________________________
Once you’ve playtested that change, record the results here.

When I playtested the game with my new objective change:
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________

Step 6: Add a Mechanism
Add a mechanism to the game. Here are some ideas:
■■
■■
■■
■■

■■

Instead of bumping another piece, stack the tokens on top of each other.
Add tokens with arrows pointing in different directions such as diagonal.
Allow double arrows to affect pieces that are two spaces away.
The white squares are “holes” and any piece that stops movement on it “falls through”
the board and is discarded.
Add a red token that, if it collides with another token, “explodes,” removing the piece
from play no matter where it is on the board.

You can see how any of these new mechanisms can radically change the gameplay. Go ahead
and come up with one of your own!
The mechanism I added is:
________________________________________________________________________
Once you’ve playtested that change, record the results here.
When I playtested the game with my new mechanism:
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________

Step 7: Change the Theme
Even though SCRAM! was designed as an abstract game, abstract games can be difficult to
sell. At the time of this writing, there are only a few game publishers that will publish a true
abstract board game. I find that you might want to consider giving your game even the slightest theme to help your chances of selling it to a publisher or even the gaming audience.

231

232

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Since pieces are being pushed around on a board, what theme could be applied to SCRAM!?
Penguins slipping around on ice? Hockey players fighting for control of the puck? Aliens
fighting for control of a planet? Bumper cars at an amusement park slamming into each
other? It could be anything! Go ahead and determine your own idea to re-­theme SCRAM!
My new theme for SCRAM! is:
___________________________________________________________
Of course, once you’ve rethemed your game, you might need to change some of the components to match that theme. Perhaps change the art around the edges of the game board or
the images on the tokens or the colors on the grid. Of course, the rules might change to
reflect the new theming. Creating thematic terms for your components and gameplay help
get the player in the mood of your theme.
Write the new rules here:

_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

The theme can make a big difference to a game, which is why the next chapters are going to
address this very topic.

The Mensa Select Award
There is one benefit to designing an abstract game, and that is they are often nominated and
awarded the Mensa Select Award, an award given out by the Mensa organization.

L e t ’ s M a k e a B oard G am e

Mensa is a club for people with high IQs and often love the challenge that abstract games
present. As a game inventor, it’s a big deal to win a Mensa award,17 so if you design an abstract
board game, make sure that you or your publisher submits it to the Mensa organization for
consideration at mensamindgames.com/register/submit-­your-­game/. If you

Mastermind (1971)—­A favorite from childhood, this two-­player code-­breaking game
still holds up. It’s simple to learn and fast to play. I love the 70s version’s iconic
box cover.
Hive (2000)—­Capture the queen bee using unique tiles in this simple but deep
strategy game.
Zendo (2001)—­Guess your opponent’s hidden pattern. Zendo remains the best example of inductive reasoning I’ve seen in a board game.
Tsuro (2005)—­Your pieces swoop around the board as you try to outlast your opponents in this beautiful abstract title.

My own game Pantone the Game was nominated for a Mensa award in 2018.

“Qwirkle!”
Onitama (2014)—­This chess-­like two-­player strategy game has its roots in titles such
as Kung Fu (1978) in which you maneuver your pieces to defeat your opponent’s and
control their temple space.
Letter Tycoon (2015)—­This is a clever twist on word games; not only do you try to build
words, but they earn you money to claim the patent on letters that your rivals
might use.
Tak (2017)—­Inspired by the works of author Patrick Rothfuss, two players compete to
build a complete road using tiles that can stack or stand on edge.
Azul (2017)—­Draft and place colorful tiles to create point-­scoring patterns.

Game boards help create the magic circle for players.
Game boards have both shared spaces and unique spaces.
Use the game board to help create table presence.
The less symbolic a game is, the more of a simulation it is, while the less realistic a game is, the more symbolic it can be.
All game boards, no matter how detailed, are an abstraction.
Abstract games are known as combinatorial games.
The easier an abstract game is to play, the more depth can be created with
its gameplay.
Word games are abstract games too!

IT WAS ON the Internet in the mid-­1990s when American gamers started to hear the buzz
about a new kind of board game—­board games that weren’t about forcing opponents into
bankruptcy, exploring dungeons, or driving a little car through one’s life.
These games were about building farms and factories, and their themes were about building,
nurturing, and growing. They had beautifully illustrated boards and charming components
made of wood instead of plastic. And they could be bought only in Germany. This new kind
of game—­this German game—­would have a profound effect on the entire board game
design world.

A Short History of the “German Game”

236

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Nuremberg, Germany, had long been known as the toy capital of the world. As far back as the
1400s, the city had been home to doll-­makers, tin-­toy craftsmen, wood carvers of hobby
horses, and inventors of parlor games.
In 1883, Bavarian bookseller Otto Maier moved to Nuremberg and founded a publishing
company that printed instructional pamphlets. In 1884, he published something new, a
board game called Reise um die Erde: ein humoristisches geographisches Gesellschafts spiel.1 The
game became a huge hit, and by 1892, Maier concentrated his printing and publishing efforts
primarily on board games. He called his new publishing venture Ravensburger. By 1902,
Ravensburger was printing more than 100 board games and translating popular foreign
games into other European languages.
When World War I broke out, production of all toys ceased in Nuremburg. The factories that
had once produced tin soldiers were now producing weapons for real ones. Military production continued through World War II, and there was even a general ban on all toy production
issued in 1943. After World War II ended, Germany started to rebuild its factories despite a
boycott on German-­produced goods, and by 1950, German toy production had returned.
Sick of war and war-­themed things, Germans turned their toy-­making efforts from producing toy guns and tanks to less violent toys including board games. The German toy industry
boomed, and to celebrate its return, the first International Toy Fair was held in Nuremburg.
Board games emerged as part of Germany’s national identity. German families would often
play board games together, and they became synonymous with “family values.” As a result,
interest in board gaming started to rise. However, many of these games weren’t German in
