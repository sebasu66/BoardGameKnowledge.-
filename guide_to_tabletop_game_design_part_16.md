rush out to spend it!

Royalty Rate
A royalty is the money that you earn for each copy of the game that has been sold. Because
the publisher takes most of the financial risk and has other financial obligations (such as
licensing, printing, distribution, etc.), they get the larger share of the profits. However,
I believe that a game designer should share in that profit.
The average royalty rate is between 2 percent and 10 percent of money received for each copy
of the game sold. I’ve heard of larger rates—­around 20 to 25 percent—­but those rates are
commanded only by “famous” designers who have designed big hits or have a reputation for
repeated success. That’s not to say that you can’t get those larger rates—­sometimes a publisher is generous. My advice? Negotiate for as much as you can without causing financial
hardship to the publisher; it’s just as much the responsibility of the designer to be a good
partner to the publisher as it is for the publisher to be a good partner to the designer. You can
negotiate for a higher rate, but you run the risk of appearing too greedy and damaging your
relationship with your publisher. That said, it never hurts to ask. The worst they can
say is “no.”
There are other factors that can determine your royalty rate. For example, when I was designing a game based on a big-­name intellectual property (IP), a big part of the publisher’s
cost was paying for that IP. I was told I had to take a smaller royalty because of the high cost
of the IP.
To figure out your anticipated royalty rate, ask the publisher how many copies of the game
will be made. In my experience, 3,000 copies of a game is a standard run for a hobby game
publisher, while 30,000 copies are a standard run for a mass-­market publisher. If the publisher prints 3,000 copies of your game (an average print run) and the game is sold for $20
each and you’re getting 10% royalty, then you’re going to get $6,000 for that entire print run.
Well, $6,000 for all that work and effort into making your game might not feel like a lot of
money to you. This is why it is so important for a game to have more than one print run; you
often won’t earn much on the initial print run. It’s good to know how much you will earn so
when you receive your royalty check, you’re not disappointed at how small it is.
A royalty should be paid to the designer each financial quarter (there are four a year), and the
publisher should provide records of how many games were sold. You will want to make sure
that your contract says when you will be paid, usually quarterly but sometimes annually.
Some contracts say that the royalty will be paid only if a minimum amount is earned (often
around $100), and if that doesn’t happen, the royalty rolls over into the next quarterly payment. Once the profits get over the predetermined amount, a payment will be issued. Make

375

376

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

sure to clarify how often you get paid. What happens if there is a missed payment? Is there a
penalty that must be paid by the publisher? How are you receiving your payment? Is it paid
electronically or via a check that is mailed to you? Get answers to as many of these questions
as possible so that everything is clearly defined within your contract.
One way to increase your royalty rate is to add a clause in your contract that says if a game
sells more than a predetermined number of copies, your royalty rate goes up—­this is
known as a sliding scale. For example, your initial contract might be for 5 percent, but if
10,000 or more copies are sold, your royalty rate increases to 8 percent on all additional copies sold. The more games that are sold, the more you earn. It helps to ask the publisher how
many copies they are planning on making ahead of time. It does you no good to have this
clause in your contract if they aren’t planning on printing more games. If the publisher prints
a second print run (or more) of your game, you should have your royalty rate go up—­
usually by a few percentage points. This is different than the second edition, which usually
involves changes to the gameplay, rules, or artwork.

Other Rights and Issues
Another way to earn money in your contract is from internationally translated copies of
your game. When a game is translated into a foreign language (one that is different than the
language the game is originally printed in), you should get a percentage of the sum of the
game when it was sold to the foreign publisher and also royalties from the sale of the game in
the foreign country. This should be a higher percentage than your standard royalty—­
sometimes as high as 25 percent.
Another thing to include in a contract is the first rights of refusal for expansions, second
editions, or any other derivative works that could be created based on your game. This means
that you get “first crack” at creating any new material based on your core game. If you refuse,
the publisher might have another designer create it, meaning no profits for you. However,
you can negotiate whether you get an advance or royalty on those derivative products.
If your game is being offered on Kickstarter or some other form of crowdfunding, then you
should negotiate a higher royalty rate. Often the production run of games printed for
Kickstarter is different than those for traditional distribution. You could also ask for a different rate for any games sold via an electronic medium such as Amazon or some other website.

Complimentary Copies
Comps is the industry term for “free” copies of the final game you will receive for making the
game. I usually ask for either six copies or a case of games that I’ve worked on. These comps
are great for self-­promotion (such as handing out to the press or gifting to a gaming café’s
library), you can give them to friends and family as gifts, and don’t forget to save a copy for
your own library.

CHAPTER 10

L e t ’ s S e ll a B oa r d G am e

Another subject you can write into your contract is whether you have the option to buy
more copies of your game from the publisher. What price can you buy them for? Can you
buy them at the wholesale cost? Lower than wholesale cost? Can you buy the remaining
stock if your game ever goes out of print? It will go out of print one day.

Rights Reversion
There’s about a 99.9 percent chance that even if your game is published, it will eventually go
out of print. However, if you are licensing your game, then you can write in your contract
that the rights will revert to you when this happens. This means you get back the rights to
your game to do what you will with it.
You must specify what aspects of the game reverts to you. Is it the game’s design only, or
does it include the art and other assets created for the game? Do you own the title of the
game, or is that trademarked by the publisher? Getting your rights back is important for a
designer because board games can have life after their initial publication. For example, after
the rights to Reiner Knizia’s movie studio–themed game Dream Factory (2000) reverted to
him, he was able to sell it to a different publisher to make the horror movie game Nightmare
Productions (2022). Dr. Knizia can once again earn a profit from a game he designed more
than 20 years ago!

Media and Products
As Hollywood realizes that games are bigger and bigger influences on popular culture, they
will turn to them as a possible source of intellectual property.
I will tell board game publishers that if they want to negotiate for the toy, video game, clothing, or media (film, TV, or streaming) rights, then they must do it as a separate contract. It’s
a totally different type of financial structuring deal. There are wildly different things to negotiate for, and they have their own pitfalls.
However, a publisher might ask for the rights in your contract that focus on “ancillary” products like game mats, Kickstarter stretch goals, and miniature sets. I personally think these
types of products are fine because they make your game a better product.

Always Be Selling
There’s an old saying: “Luck is when preparation meets opportunity.” The only way to get
“lucky” with a publisher is by getting your game out there and letting people know about it.
Attend speed-­dating events to get your game in front of the world.

377

Promote your game at conventions, and in between playtest sessions have meetings with
publishers to introduce them to your game. Don’t be discouraged if these meetings do not
result in a sale (it is rare to walk away from a meeting with a publisher with a deal). It’s just as
important to make friends at these meetings as it is to show that you are a talented designer.
You never know where a meeting with someone will lead!
Promote your work on social media. Don’t be afraid to share your game (remember, no one is
going to “steal it”—­we’re all too busy making our own games!). I have been scolded by some
people who think that I’m promoting my games too much, but my thinking is “If I don’t promote myself and my games, then who will?” The answer is no one will. You must do it yourself.
Whew! That’s a lot to know about licensing a game to a publisher. But that’s just one way to
get your game out into the world. Let’s look at another.

Self-­Funding
If you have the means, you can always self-­fund your game. This is where you pay for everything yourself—­from the printing of the game to distribution. I always think of Merle
Robbins, the inventor of UNO (1971) who created 5,000 decks to sell out of his barber shop
and the trunk of his car. I have seen plenty of other designers create small runs of their
games and sell them at local conventions and to their friends and family.
You know what? That’s a perfectly fine way to get your game into the world. After all, the goal
as a game designer is to make games that make people happy and forget their troubles for
even just a little bit. But just remember that you have to pay sales tax on your games and
declare income (or loss) when it comes time to file taxes.
If you think pitching to a publisher is a lot of work, publishing the game by yourself is even
more work. As you are developing the game, are you also prepared to market your game by
contacting the press? Are you ready to contact overseas printers to produce the game, willing
to contact distribution companies to help get your game where it needs to go, and able to
reach out to game stores all around the country or world to request they sell your game?
Do you have space in your house or garage or storage unit to store thousands of copies of
your game?
If none of these scare you, it should. If you still think it sounds like it could be an adventure,
then let’s talk about crowdfunding.

Crowdfunding
In 2015, 228 backers pledged $14,885 to bring the board game Alien Frontiers to life. This
sci-­fi worker placement game was considered the first big success on the six-­year-­old crowdfunding platform Kickstarter (kickstarter.com) and kicked off a revolution in the
board game industry.
Since then, thousands of board games have been kickstarted. The highest-­grossing games
include Frosthaven (2023) with $12.8 million, Kingdom Death: Monster 1.5 (2015) with
$12.4 million and Exploding Kittens (2015) with $8.7 million. But keep in mind, these are
outliers. Many Kickstarter game projects are barely funded, and others never fund at all.
Regardless, the excitement generated by Kickstarter and other subsequent crowdfunding
platforms such as Indigogo, GameFound, and BackerKit created a gold rush of games as
designers rushed to these platforms with dreams of getting their games published and striking it rich.
Crowdfunding is a very deep topic. If you choose to do crowdfunding, then it’s important
to get it right, as there are many mistakes that can be made along the way—­costly ones.
If you are serious about learning what it takes to run a crowdfunding campaign, then you
need to read the following websites presented by experts on the topic. These sites go far
deeper than this book can cover.

Marketing
Crowdfunding lives and dies by awareness. You want to start marketing your game at least
6 months ahead of when you are planning to run your campaign. You will need to start showing your game publicly, preferably at gaming conventions where it will get some attention.
Start a mailing list to gather the emails of potential customers. Take interesting pictures and
videos of your game to show on social media including sites such as Facebook, Instagram,
Reddit, Discord, TikTok, and Twitch. Start a page on BBG or create a landing page website
and post the rules so players can learn how to play your game before it comes out. Get pictures of people playing your game, painting the minis, and buying your game. Ask stores to
carry your game. Go onto podcasts and talk about your game. When it comes out, do in-­store
signings of your published game. Remember, no one will be more excited about your game
than you are. Do whatever it takes to let people know that your game is coming.

Previews
The average crowdfunding page has three video previews/reviews and at least that many
written recommendations from influencers and reviewers. There are many influencers and
content creators who specialize in crowdfunding previews. Some of these creators charge
money to create a preview video. Others will review your game if you send them a review
copy. If you watch these preview videos, you’ll notice that the copies of the game that their
designers have sent look very close to the finished product. You will want to make sure the
review copy of your game is presentable, even beautiful. There is a danger to sending a game
to a reviewer: they might not like your game, and a negative review will do you no good!
There is really no way to mitigate this risk, as it is up to the reviewer to be as honest as possible. It’s just a risk you’ll have to take.

The Campaign
Back in the early days of Kickstarter, all you needed was a short video explaining why you
wanted to make the game and a couple of pictures to get people excited. Today’s crowdfunding pages are extremely elaborate affairs that utilize graphic design, motion graphics, video,
and other visuals to explain the game and what you are offering to the backer. Countdown
timers, shipping cost outlines, production trackers, cargo ship trackers, and frequent updates
that engage with the backers in the comments section will keep them coming back to your
page during the campaign.
Two of the most important things to consider when running a campaign is the length of
the campaign and the goal of the campaign. The average crowdfunding campaign runs
20 to 30 days. Some claim that the month that you run it during is critical. Some swear
spring months are best, while others claim fall is better. Whenever you run your campaign,
you need to be aware what other games are going to be running during your campaign.

CHAPTER 10

L e t ’ s S e ll a B oa r d G am e

The last thing you need is an expensive and popular campaign sucking all the air and funding
away from yours.
The goal is the amount that you are asking your backers for to fund the production of the
game. Kickstarter expert Jamey Stegmaier4 asks you to consider these questions:
■■
■■
■■

What is the minimum amount of money needed to make the game a reality?
How much lower than that minimum amount of money can the funding goal be?
What is the cost to you if you receive funding for 500 units? 1,000? 1,500?

In the comments of this blog, poster Derek Sheridan offers up this simple formula to determine costs and fees:
(Minimum order quantity * Landed cost per unit) – Personal investment {not art and marketing, but rather the amount of personal investment you will put into manufacturing}) +
Kickstarter and Stripe5 fees.
Then round up (always up) to at least the nearest thousand.
He continues with this example: If you have a minimum order quantity (MOQ) of 2,000
units and a landed cost per unit of $15 ($12 manufacturing and $3 freight—­including
import duties and taxes), with no personal investment, your absolute minimum funding goal is:
(2,000 * $15) – $0) + $3,000 = $30,000 + $3,000 = $33,000
Sheridan says that this will ensure that the manufacturer is paid, the freight shipping is paid,
and Kickstarter is paid. All that’s left to do is collect fulfillment shipping costs and pay fulfillment companies—­plus warehousing, etc., that is incurred after the game is made. That’s a lot
to account for just to make sure you are setting your goal to the correct amount.
If this is a lot to take in, trust me it is. But there is help to be found. Some of the sites that I
mentioned earlier have excellent checklists for running a crowdfunding campaign. Some
even have a timeline for you to follow as you march toward your starting date.
While I haven’t run a crowdfunding campaign by myself, I do know from my friends who
have that they tend to be exhausting. During the entire time your campaign runs, you still
have many things to do. You will need to advertise what is happening on social media and

in-­person at conventions and in-­store appearances. You will want to field all of the questions
and criticisms about your game from the public who know very little about your game. You
will find yourself tempted to look often as the number of backers (and their pledges) climbs
toward your goal. Dealing with the anxiety of a Kickstarter (even if you aren’t running it,
there is still the anxiety of being involved) is a real issue. Take a break from your campaign. It
will still be there when you come back.
Elan Lee, the designer behind Exploding Kittens, says that he runs his campaign like a party.
He’s less worried about funding and more interested in the backers having fun. Publisher
Cardboard Alchemy’s Kickstarter campaigns (Flamecraft [2022], Dwellings of Eldervale) tend
to be full of puzzles and games for the backers to play. If they solve them, they can win extras
like exclusive miniatures and collector’s coins.
Many publishers are obsessed with funding a game within a short time span, such as the first
24 hours or within a week, but don’t be discouraged if this doesn’t happen. These are just
arbitrary marketing targets to get buyers more excited or make them experience FOMO (fear
of missing out). In the end, all that matters is that your game funds.

Add-­ons and Stretch Goals
The term stretch goal was first used in a board game campaign on Kickstarter in CMON’s
Zombicide (2012). A stretch goal is an additional goal, above and beyond the initial funding
goal requirements of the project. They are small bonuses—­such as improved card quality,
bonus cards, miniatures, UV spot printing, upgrading components from paper to wood,
etc.—­that are unlocked to give more content to your backers. It’s an exciting way to keep
backers engaged as the funding grows. The more backers you get, the more stretch goals they
unlock, encouraging more backers to join in the fun.
Stretch goals are usually spaced out along funding milestones. For a small, new game, these
goals might be every $5,000 or $10,000 from the original funding goal. Stretch goals can be
a way to get content into your game that you originally intended but just couldn’t afford. The
mercenary captain miniatures, the upgraded plastic tokens and draw bag, and the raygun
models are examples of stretch goals we had in our campaign for Rayguns and Rocketships.
Some of them were planned for the game such as the mercenaries, while others like the raygun models were created specifically as stretch goals for the campaign.
How is it that stretch goals can be offered for “nothing”? That’s because printers will reduce
the cost per copy of a game by printing additional copies; thus, this per-­copy savings can be
applied to the cost of the stretch goal items! The more you earn, the more you save!
There are pros and cons to having stretch goals. They can make your game more appealing to
backers, as well as increase traffic to your campaign page. You can even have backers suggest

CHAPTER 10

L e t ’ s S e ll a B oa r d G am e

or vote on new goals to keep them engaged. However, there are potential downsides too.
All of the additional content may increase productions costs, the weight of your game box,
and the cost to ship it as well as delay your production.
These issues are not to be taken lightly. The slightest change of weight can push you into the
next pricing tier. This means your backers will have to pay more for shipping, which will
anger your backers if they don’t know it is coming. This happened to CMON’s Marvel
Zombicide campaign in 2022 when backers were informed that they would have to pay up to
an unexpected $200 for shipping!
Add-­ons are items that a backer can add onto their pledge for an additional cost. These can
be an expansion, miniatures, or plussed-­up components. Add-­ons are a less risky way for you
to offer more content, but it does complicate preparing orders and creates wildly different
shipping costs.

Production
Knowing how much your game will cost is critical. To determine that, you are going to have
to contact a printer. There are dozens of companies that can print a game. You can find a list
at boardgamemanufacturers.info.
But which company is the best? That depends on your budget, the size of your print run, and
what components you need for your game. There are other differences between printers too.
For example, some print only cards, whereas others can print miniatures; some can make
metal or wooden components or can print using special techniques or inks.
You also want to consider where a factory is located. The majority are in China, which means
you will have to ship your game overseas, and that takes time and can be very expensive.
The first step is to determine the minimum viable product. This is your game with the minimum number of components that it needs to be playable. You might have created other
content, but depending on the cost, you might want to save those for an expansion, an add­on, or a stretch goal.
A good way to double-­check what you’ll need is to use a site like the Game Crafter
(thegamecrafter.com), Print and Play (printplaygames.com), or Board Game
Makers (BoardGameMakers.com). These companies have lists of sizes and scales of
components, as well as templates that you can use to help create your game. They also do
small print runs that are useful when creating prototypes. Make sure you know your component’s measurements (length × width × height) in centimeters. It also helps to know what

383

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

materials and finishes you’ll want for your components. Some common materials and finishes include the following:

Cardstock is thicker and stiffer than regular writing or copier paper but thinner and
more flexible than illustration or cardboard. It’s best for cards, especially larger Tarot-­
sized ones.
Illustration board is even thicker than cardstock. It comes in two surfaces, hot and
cold press, which gives them different textures. (Cold is smooth; hot is rough).
Chipboard is usually thicker and hardier than ordinary cardstock. It’s good for small
projects that need to be sturdy—­like paper craft items such as standees and dice towers.
Plastic cards are waterproof and great for cards that will be handled over and over or
by messy players like very young children.
Laminate cards have a surface that you can draw on with a dry erase marker. They
are also shinier and tend to hold up better when handled frequently or roughly.
Black core refers to the inside (or “core”) of a card. Black core doesn’t allow for light to
shine through so that players can’t see the other side of the card.
Foil cards can refer to several different treatments to cards that make them shiny or
even hold holographic images.
Matte refers to a texture or treatment on the surface of a card that absorbs light, making it easier to read.
Gloss refers to a texture or treatment on the surface of a card that makes it reflective
and harder to read in bright light.
Transparent cards are made of plastic and can be seen through. Images are screened
onto the card.
Acrylic is a thicker clear plastic that is often used for standees or guides. An image is
often screen printed onto them.
Linen is a textured coating normally found on playing cards. To many, the term linen
evokes a sense of refinement, and linen cards are often offered as an upgrade.
Neoprene is a synthetic rubber often used for card mats. Images can be printed
onto them.
Spot UV is an ink that reacts to light, making it look “wet” or shinier under the light.
The “spot” refers to the details that the reflective ink brings out on the box
cover or board.
Die-­cut is when a board is cut to an unusual shape. A die is used to cut standees, tiles,
boards, puzzle pieces, and more. A die punch is used to cut shapes in thicker board.
Two layers of punched boards are glued to create dual-­layered boards.

Remember, this is all on top of playtesting your game and commissioning (and dealing with)
artists and graphic designers, game developers, and rulebook editors/layout artists!

CHAPTER 10

Pricing
Once you have figured out the dimensions and materials of your game, you will send that
information to the printer for a quote based on the number of games that you want to print.
Part of that cost will include the price to assemble all the pieces into the game box. Someone
has to do it! Sometimes, components come from several different printers and factories and
must be sent to a central location. That’s an additional cost that you will have to pay.
The average hobby board game print run is 3,000 copies. A mass market game sold in a “big
box” store (like Walmart or Target) might print 10 times (or more) that amount. Ten thousand copies sold is considered a success in the board game industry. If you sell 100,000 or
more, you’re a big hit! Passing the one million mark isn’t unheard of, but those numbers are
usually achieved by games that either are sold internationally or have been in publication
for a while.
Board games (and all factory-­made items) benefit from economy of scale: the more that
you make, the cheaper it is. Once you have your estimate of the overall cost and the individual cost per unit, you can figure out how much to charge for your game. The average board
game is priced five (or more) times the cost of printing it.
Considering the economy of scale, a single die might cost 10 cents, but it costs 6 cents if you
have one in 500 games. And it would cost 2 cents apiece if you are printing 3,000 games.
Similarly, a single card might cost only 2 or 3 cents, but if you have a deck of 52 of them, now
it costs $1! Now add in the box (one of the most expensive components), the tray, the rulebook, and any other items to get the cost. You need to know how many of each component
and what each component costs when determining the cost of your game. If your game costs
$20 to produce and ship but your price is $19.99, then you have a big problem!
Setting the price of your game is where you have some flexibility. The price of what you sell
your game at is known as the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP). The MSRP
is set high to give the store some flexibility when selling the game. Those “buy one, get one
half-­off” sales at the big-­box stores? Those prices are set so that they are still making money
at those reduced prices.
The best strategy for setting your game’s MSRP is to look at games of comparable box and
content size, but you have to consider the customer’s perception of what a product should
cost. For example, a game that is “just” a few decks of cards usually sells for $20 or less.
Anything higher than that and the consumer will say that it is too expensive. Then again, the
gaming community appears to have no problem spending hundreds of dollars on games in
big boxes with lots of miniatures!

And after all of this, once you finally get your money from your successful crowdsourcing
campaign (minus the fees the crowdfunding site charges), you still need to pay all associated
parties and keep good tax records! Speaking of taxes, you need to be aware of what you will
have to pay come tax time! Should you incorporate and file as a limited liability company
(LLC)? Can you deduct expenses? What kind of accrual method should you use? I’ve found
an excellent guide online to help answer these questions (boardgamedesignlab.com/
wp-­content/uploads/2021/03/Board-­Game-­Design-­Lab-­Tax-­Guide

All those games that you’ve printed at an overseas factory, they’ve got to get to you somehow. And once they arrive, they must go somewhere. I don’t know about you, but I don’t
have the space in my house to store 3,000 board games.
Shipping can be one of the biggest pitfalls for a creator who is publishing their own game. I’ve
heard many horror stories about this step of the process, such as the cost of shipping containers going up in price by a factor of 10! There can also be extra fees that you might not
think about such as the extra cost for having multiple boxes (or cases) of your game sent
using a pallet. The ship carrying your games might even sink in a storm! There are dozens of
different methods available for shipping that have various pros and cons, which usually balance speed with cost, but also includes who pays shipping and who is responsible for shipping. There are too many options to be covered here, but all I can say is do your research,
reach out to people who might have used these shipping companies, and compare several
companies before making your choice.
Storing games can be expensive. You can rent a local storage unit to hold them, or you can
have them shipped to a distribution center, which is a warehouse that holds your games
for you (for a fee) and ships them to your customers when they are bought (for a fee). Will
you offer international shipping? Most modern campaigns do. As a result, many publishers
have made deals with distributors in other countries because it is cheaper to ship cases or
pallets of their games overseas direct from the factory. These foreign distribution centers
then ship the game to buyers in their native countries.
Sending games to customers is known as fulfillment. There can be lots of problems during
this stage. A game might not have been packed correctly and be missing components. A box
(and the game inside) might get damaged during shipping. A thief might steal the game from
the porch of the customer even though it arrived safely. It is your job, as the game’s publisher, to field these problems. If pieces are lost, you should replace them. . .as long as you
have the pieces to send to the customer. Other issues such as damage or theft are trickier to
deal with. Sometimes a publisher will take a loss to make a customer happy. Other times, not
so much. Which kind of publisher do you want to be?

L e t ’s Do I t A ll O ver A gai n!
GIVE YOURSELF A pat on the back. You’ve created six game designs! That’s amazing!
At the beginning of this book, I said that you would learn to make games by copying me, but
now it’s time for you to make a game from scratch. Many find a blank canvas to be daunting,
but I know several tricks you can use. The following are areas that can help you get started:
■■
■■

A mechanism (or two)
The theme
A story
The title
Components
The player count
A “moment”
An experience or mood
The publisher’s need

Each of these is a unique way to get started in creating your very own game. Let’s dig
into them.

Starting with a Mechanism (or Two)
We’ve covered dozens of mechanisms in this book. Are there some that you find more interesting than others? Is there a particular game you like that you want to see if you can make
your own version? The designer of UNO (1971) was inspired by the classic card game Crazy
Eights. The designers of Quarriors! (2011) wanted to make a deck builder like Dominion (2008)
but with dice instead of cards.
A great way to do this is to combine one mechanism with another. For example, Stone Age
(2008) is a worker placement game that adds dice rolling. You must spend resources to “feed”
your workers after you have placed them in Agricola (2007). Dwellings of Eldervale (2020)

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

allows you to convert a worker in play into a dwelling for points. These “small” differences in
how the mechanisms work end up making each of these games feel unique.
There really is no limit to the number of mechanisms you can combine, but remember, the
more mechanisms that you use, the more complicated your game will become. It’s easy to
keep adding things to a design and create a complicated game, but it’s harder to create something simple and elegant. Sometimes simpler is better.

Starting with the Theme
Before I designed Rayguns and Rocketships (2017), I watched movies, read books and comics,
and researched images until I was extremely knowledgeable about the genre of 1930s pulp
science fiction. (It didn’t hurt that I was already a fan before I started designing the game!)
I find that designing a game by starting with a genre can inspire many aspects of your game’s
design—­from gameplay and mechanisms to artwork and story.
Where it gets interesting is when you try to design a game based on a genre that is less commonly used in board games. There are countless games about fantasy, science fiction, horror,
history, and adventure, but few about comedy, romance, biographies, and melodrama.
It might be more challenging to design a game around these lesser-­used genres. The following is a list of topics that I’ve never seen board games about:
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

A dungeon-­crawler set in the human body
A game about the Paris to Madrid automobile race of 1903
A game about the stonecutters who cut marble for Italian renaissance artists
A science-­fiction game about love
A game about writing dime-­store novels set in the 1880s

Who knows, perhaps there is an audience who has been waiting for a board game about
these themes.
Sometimes you realize that there are just too many games of a particular theme. Or that you
just aren’t an expert on a theme, despite any research you do. You might need to change your
theme even as you are working on the game. Twilight Struggle (2005) designers Ananda
Gupta and Jason Matthews were working on a game about the Spanish Civil War but learned
a similar game was being made by a designer in Spain. “We’re probably not going to do a better job than he is,” Gupta joked, so they eventually settled on the Cold War.1

L e t ’ s D o I t A ll O v e r A gai n !

Starting with a Story
Designer Jerry Hawthorne was inspired to create Mice and Mystics (2012) after he told his
young daughter a bedtime story about the adventures of mice. Designer Mike Fitzgerald
realized the connection between the card play in the classic card game of Rummy and the
structure of a mystery story, so he combined them to create Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper
(1998). Both games started with a story, whether they were fictional or factual.
Board games are wonderful storytelling devices; after all, they use all the tools that a storybook does: words, images, characters, and conflict. The classic three-­act structure and the
dramatic arc offer game designers a strong framework that can be used to design a game.
Some games tell a “fixed” story such as The 7th Continent (2017), T.I.M.E. Stories (2015), and
Fury of Dracula (1987). Other games offer stories with multiple paths such as Choose Your
Own Adventure: House of Danger (2018), Tales of the Arabian Nights (2009), and Betrayal at the
House on the Hill (2004). What story will you tell?

Starting with the Title
Titles are powerful tools. They can capture the spirit of a game immediately. A good title
quickly and effectively communicates the story, theme, or mechanism to the player from the
moment they pick up the box. Looking for more inspiration? Here are some ways you can
choose the title of your game:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Name it after a character or a place: The Batman Game, Merchant of Venus, Sagrada,
Carcassonne.
Name it after an activity in the game: Twister, Kill Doctor Lucky, Acquire, Roll for
the Galaxy.
Give it a descriptive title: The Awful Green Things from Outer Space, Hey Pa! There’s a
Goat on the Roof! or Dead of Winter: A Cross-­roads Game.
Give it a “cinematic” title: Fortress America, Through the Desert, Shadows over
Camelot, Fury of Dracula, Everybody Knows.
Give it a purple cow* title: Jenga, Qwirkle, Qwixx, Qwiddler, Farkle.

A “purple cow” title is a marketing concept where you choose a name for a product that
“makes your audience stop in their tracks and wonder why the title was chosen.”

When starting with a title, make sure you do your research first. Choose a title that hasn’t
been used before or isn’t too close to the title of another published game. I recommend doing
both a Google search as well as a thorough search on BoardGameGeek.com. If you find

NOTE

392

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

that your game has the same name, it’s generally better just to change it. If your game’s name
is taken, don’t worry; there are plenty of words (in many different languages) out there to use!

Start with Components
The good news is you can make a board game from just about anything. I’ve seen designers
create games using toy dinosaurs, magnets, foam guns, an actual bell, inflatable caveman
clubs, dental dams, and even lasers!
Using a component in a clever way can make for an appealing game. Interesting components
will draw players in. Never underestimate the “toy factor” of a component. The shape, size,
and texture of a component can make a huge difference in how the component is used both
in the game and by the player. The game Bootleggers uses standard wooden cubes to represent
boxes of liquor, which look particularly thematic when they are placed in the backs of little
plastic trucks!
Some games use unique versions of standard components to create new mechanisms and
game play. The games Gloom (2005) and Canvas (2021) both use transparent plastic cards but
each in totally different ways. The Funkoverse Strategy Game (2019) was created when Funko
wanted to make a board game using their Pop! Figures. Try looking at an old component in a
new way and perhaps you can invent something new!

Starting with the Player Count
Let’s say you want to design a game for a large number of players, such as those attending a
family gathering or some other get-­together. You can design a fast-­paced party game that can
accommodate a large number of players like Pictionary (1985), Pantone the Game (2018), and
Cards Against Humanity (2009). What if your social group is smaller? You could design a
game that plays better with fewer players such as Ticket to Ride (2004), Pandemic (2008), or
Lords of Waterdeep (2012).
But what happens if you have no one to play with at all? Then design a solo game! Solo games
are popular, and more are coming out all the time. Games designed for a single player include
Friday (2011), Lord of the Rings: The Card Game (2011), and Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the
Cursed Island (2012), while multiplayer games like Mage Knight (2011), Massive Darkness
(2017), and Scythe (2106) offer robust solo play modes. Here are a few tips when designing
solo games:
■■

Create an objective: Solo players prefer a solid objective. Rather than “get a high
score,” try to have the players aim for something concrete like raise enough gold to hire
an army and take back the kingdom as in Barbarian Prince (1980), defeat all four boss

CHAPTER 11

L e t ’ s D o I t A ll O v e r A gai n !

monsters as in Unbroken (2018), or reach the “good” ending of a story as in Choose Your
Own Adventure: House of Danger (2018).
Reduce the number of characters or player positions used in your game to a
single character: While it’s perfectly possible to play any board games “by yourself,”
some players find it confusing to handle multiple characters. It can get confusing to
remember which character moved what and when. Plus, you can’t keep secret
information—­secret roles or hands of cards—­to yourself!
Reduce the amount of upkeep (the times a component is manipulated) during gameplay: It’s a drag to do these kinds of mechanical operations: “First, I tap a
farmland card for one mana, so I can play dairy cow. Because dairy cow is a dairy type
and I have greenest grass in play, I get five milk counters, and if I sell the five milk
counters to the grocery store, I get 15 dairy dollars.”2 These types of component gymnastics just get tedious, especially when you have no one to show them off for.
Include a challenge: Solo gamers want a challenge, which means that a solo game
can be more difficult than a “standard” board game because when the player wins a
solo game, then it’s over. There’s usually not much of a reason to play it again unless
the play experience was either really fun or really challenging. Solo games notorious for
their difficulty include Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island (2012), Mage
Knight (2011), and Under Falling Skies (2020).

Starting with a “Moment”
Another way to start designing a game is around a moment that you want the player to experience while playing your game. It can be the rush of pleasure from gaining a pile of resources,
the thrill of the tide of a battle turning, a sense of dread from the inevitable appearance of a
horrible monster, or the sting of betrayal from a player you’ve trusted. Capturing these
moments will help give players great memories long after they’ve finished playing your game.

Starting with an Experience
Game designer Catherine Stippell has an uncle who is blind but loved to play games. She
asked herself, “What if the tables were turned and we as sighted people had to adapt?” As she
tried to capture that experience, she created the game Nyctophobia (2018).
By focusing on creating an experience for the player—­making them feel powerful or helpless
or hunted—­can be a great starting place for a game design. Then search out the mechanisms
that will help you create those feelings within the players.

Starting with the Publisher’s Need
Designing a game is a lot of hard work and effort, and you want to give your game the best
opportunity to succeed. Rather than create a board game that will be a “hard sell,” why not
hedge your bets and find out what game publishers want?
On many publisher websites, you will find their submission guidelines. A publisher might list
what genres of games they are looking for. They might ask for a game to be a specific player
count or take a specific amount of time to play. They might even specify the size of the box
required for the product. By designing to the publisher’s specifications, you might have a
great chance of getting your game published!

Carrying a Sketchbook

As a game designer, I have gotten into the habit of always carrying a sketchbook wherever I
go. I never know when I am going to think of a good idea or see or hear something that
inspires me to make a game. This sketchbook is particularly valuable at gaming conventions
where I use it to write down or draw pictures of game mechanics that are new to me. I also
write the names of games that I’ve not seen before so I can buy them later! It’s also great to
track playtesting feedback (and the people who helped me with the playtest) so I have a
record that I can easily access after the show.

Inspiration for Amateurs
There’s a quote “inspiration is for amateurs,” which means that a creative professional can
think of a new idea for a game at any time. While that’s not always true, it does help to exercise your brain to be creative. It is especially important to learn how to be creative quickly.

CHAPTER 11

L e t ’ s D o I t A ll O v e r A gai n !

A good way to practice this is to participate in a board game jam or a contest at a board gaming convention. The game you create under time pressure might not be the best game you’ll
ever design, but it’s a good way for you to get better at making the most of the time
that you have.

Preventing Game Designer Burnout
Having a sketchbook is a good way to keep inspired. Making games uses a lot of creative
energy, and I’ve seen other designers burn out, especially when they are wrestling with their
designs and having trouble making sales to publishers. Here are a few techniques for preventing game designer burnout:
■■

■■

■■

■■

A little here, a little there: Do a little work on one part of your game, no matter
how small or insignificant it feels to the design. It could be checking your rule book for
types or doing an Internet search for just the right font to use on your cards. Eventually
the work will add up over time.
Play some games: Sometimes you just need to turn off the “game designer” part of
your brain and turn on the “game player.” Playing something new adds to your “tool
kit” of design tools. Like I said earlier, a game designer plays all the games—­the good
ones, the bad ones, the popular ones, the obscure ones. I challenge you to become an
expert on games—­like me!
Playtest other designer’s games: If you aren’t already friends with game designers, find a group in your area. Try Meetup or ask your local tabletop store if any designers come into playtest. You can post your own ad online or at the store! Not only will
you be helping other designers out with their designs, but you might make some new
friends too!
Find a friend: Working with a partner who can help you work on a design when you
no longer have the energy to work on it yourself is invaluable. You will feel better about
yourself when you help your partner with their workload. If you can find someone that
you like designing a game with, hang onto them. They are more valuable than diamonds.
Help: Turn to another designer for help. I have a group of good friends (who are also
awesome and successful designers) who I can turn to when I have a question or need to
solve a problem. They are always smarter than I am and often have a better perspective
on my own game than I have at the moment! Just remember that you have final say on
what advice to use and what to set aside. Remember to say “thank you” no matter what.
Write it down: I find it super-­helpful to write down the high-­level idea of your game
somewhere. This becomes the “pillars” of your design—­the reason why you wanted to
make the game in the first place. If your design starts to drift away from the pillars
(and it will drift), consider modifying or cutting those mechanisms.
Make a big change: I was working on a horror worker placement game, but it wasn’t
working out very well. I completely changed the game board as well as the player’s

objective, and it’s shaping up to a much better game design. Don’t be afraid to discard
work or ideas. Just make sure you have backups either in your sketchbook or on
your computer.
Done is better than perfect: Knowing when to stop designing your game is just as
