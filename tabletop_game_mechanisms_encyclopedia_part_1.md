Geoff:
To Susan, for a wonderful 40 years, and to our children, Brian
and Sydney, for always challenging my strategies across the game
table, and challenging my ideas across the kitchen table.
Isaac:
To my wife, a quick nod of appreciation.
Let’s not make a scene about this.
To my children, Jesse, Alex, and Maya, you are
the gaming partners of a lifetime.
To my design partner, Matt Loomis, from whom I learned
more than I could contain in this slim volume.
Lastly, to my brother, Kuty Shalev, my constant gaming partner,
my first DM, my first co-designer, my Kickstarter patron and
my coach, mentor, and cheerleader in all my pursuits.

Foreword

ӶӶ

A game is a language.
In a way, when you sit down with someone to play Chess, Poker, or Cosmic
Encounter, you are beginning a conversation.
Each move you make in the game is a way for you to express yourself to
your partner—a way for you to make meaning. Every reckless aggression and
coy bluff, every greedy power grab and defensive stall for time is a word, a
phrase, a statement in the language of the game.
These conversations we have with each other, as we play games, can
be awkward and confusing. Or deliciously cruel. Or wildly creative and
unexpectedly beautiful. The kind of conversation that tickles parts of your
mind that you didn’t know were there, the kind of conversation that sticks with
you, turns acquaintances into bitter rivals, and later into the best of friends.
But a game is not just a language.
It’s more complicated than that. The moves we make as we play are a
language built on top of yet another language. Beneath the meaning we
express through the moves of the game is a kind of hidden grammar.
You move a pawn, pass a ball to a teammate, or maneuver your virtual
avatar: all of them are statements made through gameplay. But what are the
structures that make those meanings possible? The rules that permit action?
The blood and bones and spirit that animates the body of the game as it
is played?
That, exactly, is the subject of Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design. So
prepare yourself. Between these covers lies the hidden grammar of games. The
structures behind the structures. The DNA of fun.
This book is a dictionary for the secret language of games.
You see, although games and play are ancient human endeavors (the
Egyptian game Senet is at least 5,500 years old), it’s only in the twentieth
century that games shifted from folk culture to authored media. And as

xiii

xiv

Foreword

tabletop games, role-playing games, and video games have become industries
of their own, we’ve done our best to understand them.
If you are reading this book, you are likely to be a serious game player.
Like many others, you play games, discuss them, dissect them, and sometimes
even design new ones. And for many years, many smart designers, critics,
players, and scholars have been searching for the right way to talk about
games, to understand how they work, and to figure out how best to approach
the creation of new designs.
That’s why Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design is so significant. The
incredibly detailed pages that follow, pages that crack open the inner components
of tabletop games, constitute a kind of Rosetta Stone for game grammar.
Make no mistake. This book is a big deal.
Building on their own impressive accomplishments as designers, their
relentless intellectual curiosity, and a seemingly limitless connoisseurship of
analog and digital games, Geoff and Isaac have put together a tremendously
rigorous, wonderfully insightful, and astoundingly accessible encyclopedia of
the elements that make tabletop games tick.
Why is this project so important? As someone who has studied, designed,
and taught game design for 25 years, this volume is the sort of book I realize
now I always needed. A manual for game mechanics. A foundation for
structural analysis. An inspiration for new ideas. A sourcebook for teaching
design.
On its surface, Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design might seem like
a deeply geeky endeavor, an obsession with rules and structures. The kind of
overly formalist ludology that has (rightfully) gotten into so much trouble
in recent years. And in part it is. But look deeper. In games, what seems like
pure abstract structure is inseparable from human experience. Chapter 4,
on resolving game actions (those things players do to make meaning) begins
in statistics and the mathematics of randomness. But then it moves into the
thorny terrain of the prisoner’s dilemma, engaging with psychology and
diplomacy and even ethics—structures that help shape how people treat
one another.
Reading any one of the dozens of modules in this book is like lifting up
a big mossy rock in the forest. Underneath, there’s an unexpected universe
of complexity, a miniature ecosystem of moving parts, just waiting to be
discovered.
The language of games is everywhere.

Foreword

xv

All of this gushing praise is well deserved. This book is a landmark in the
study of games. But don’t let that fool you. As enchanting as it is, Building
Blocks of Tabletop Game Design is not a magic bullet that is going to suddenly
let you understand exactly how every game works, become a tournament
winner, or guarantee that your next design will be a hit.
The hidden grammars that this book describes, the structures behind the
structures, are only part of the picture. Building Blocks of Tabletop Game
Design doesn’t investigate how games tell stories, or impact the lives of their
players, or embody ideological values, or fit into larger cultural landscapes, or
even how they might make a profit. That’s just not what this book is about.
And that’s perfectly all right. Its titanic strength comes from its incredibly
tight focus on the fundamental elements of games.
Despite these limitations, is this book still useful? Hell yes. I was recently
trying to design a bidding structure for a game, and found myself jawdroppingly enlightened, reading Chapter 8 on Auctions, which details no
less than 16 distinct bidding structures. Without a doubt, I will use this text
in my classes. I am planning, for example, to assign a project by having each
student turn to two random pages in this book and then create a game that
combines both mechanics.
But there’s more. The insights and ideas in Building Blocks of Tabletop
Game Design can be applied outside of games.
How can we resolve an argument between two entrenched opposing
positions? How should a winner in a multicandidate election be determined?
What economic incentives lead to the best distribution of wealth? What’s the
right way to ensure fairness for all? These are dilemmas of modern society.
And they are also the kinds of problems with which game designers wrestle on
a daily basis. Believe it or not, the answers to these deeply important questions
might begin to be answered by looking at the structures within structures of
this book.
Lastly, games are beautiful.
Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want to leave you with the impression that this
book is valid only because it is useful. It doesn’t matter that Building Blocks
of Tabletop Games might be used to help teach classes, or even make society
better. This book is important because it is a heartfelt and soul-enriching love
letter to games.
It is a lens to help us see the games we adore with fresh eyes. An advanced
seminar in the complexity of systems. A spell book filled with recipes for

xvi

Foreword

creative play. Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design unpacks the mystery
of how these nerdy, knotty, collections of rules—boxed up with cards, dice,
and colorful tokens—produce something which is in fact the very opposite
of rules.
For those ready to appreciate the beauty of games, the joy leaps off of every
page. Isaac and Geoff have given us whole new ways to have conversations
with the people and the games we love.
Happy reading.

Thank you to Erik Zimmerman and Doug Maynard for your excellent
feedback and insightful comments on the manuscript. The readers thank
you even more! Rob Daviau, Tim Fowers, Mark Herman, and Sen-Foong
Lim provided key early enthusiastic support, without which we would not
have embarked on this project.
This work would also not exist if not for those who blazed this trail and
whose writings have shaped our thinking. Greg Costikyan’s I Have No
Words & I Must Design: Toward a Critical Vocabulary for Games (Tampere
University Press, 2002) was Isaac’s introduction to the world of critical
thought about games. Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
Software (Addison-Wesley, 1994) by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph
Johnson, and Richard Helm showed Geoff how design concepts could be
broken down and built back up again. Rules of Play (MIT Press, 2003) by
Katie Salen and Erik Zimmerman was another foundational text. We would
also like to recognize the books, lectures and blog posts by Jesse Schell, Bruno
Faidutti and Mark Rosewater, who continue to contribute to the growing
body of thinking about games and game design.
Daniel Solis created the delightful diagrams that illustrate each mechanism.
His ability to concisely capture complex concepts is uncanny, and this book
benefits greatly from his participation.
We are also indebted to Donald Dennis, Erik Dewey, Seth Jaffee, TC Petty

James Ernst, Eric Lang, Ralph Anderson, Stephanie Straw, Nicole Kline,
Anthony Amato, Jr., Gil Hova, Ryan Sturm, Mike Fitzgerald, Tom Vasel,
Eric Summerer, all the fans and listeners of the On Board Games and Ludology
podcasts, and our boardgame Twitter family. This work is, if nothing else, a
memento of our relationships, conversations, and friendships. Thank you.
Finally, Sean and Jessica at Taylor & Francis Group were absolutely stellar
to work with, and deftly handled two demanding authors.

Introduction

ӶӶ

There is no better time to be a tabletop board gamer. Hobbyists will debate
whether the mid-1990s, which saw the rise of The Settlers of Catan and Magic:
The Gathering, was the golden age of gaming, or whether today is that golden
age. No matter what your personal view may be, there is no doubt that modern
tabletop gaming is in a period of exceptional fertility and is flourishing.
Games have come a long way since humans invented dice, pawns, and
boards, and archeologists regularly turn up these artifacts at sites dating back
6000+ years ago. The standard deck of cards has its beginnings over 1000
years ago, and with the advent of the printing press, games became an evercheaper and more ubiquitous luxury. The history of the last century or so of
games encompasses mass-market titles including Monopoly, Scrabble, Clue,
and Trivial Pursuit, as well as the emergence of a whole new genre of tabletop
games. The genre is so new that a single name has yet to meaningfully describe
it, though suggestions have included hobby games, designer games, and other,
stranger terms like TGOO (“these games of ours”). No matter what you
call them, today’s games feature higher levels of player agency, meaningful
decisions, and substantially improved production values, and offer something
entirely new to players, as compared to mass-market games.
Others have written about how war games developed into modern games
in America, and the countervailing rise of a European design sensibility in
the post-World War II period that rejected war as a setting, and direct conflict
as a game dynamic. Our goal here is different. We’d like to address not how
games evolved, but how games are designed.
Even as gaming itself has taken flight, and even as thousands of new
games are published each year to an ever-expanding audience of gamers, one
critical aspect of gaming remains in a nascent stage: the art and craft of game
design itself. Games have taken great advantage of modern communication

knowledge and skills needed to design these games. In substantial part this is
because we do not yet have a strong shared vocabulary for discussing design.
In creative industries, from literature to film to video games, practitioners,
participants, and critics develop a shared language, a common reference library,
and a set of skills, approaches, and techniques for their field. Film directors
learn the difference between a jump cut and a dolly zoom, and how different
technical approaches produce different effects. Audiences and critics follow along,
recognizing homages and allusions, and appreciating variations and innovations.
Tabletop game design is at a somewhat earlier stage, and this book is
our attempt to begin to build a broader game design vocabulary and body
of knowledge. Rather than attempting to formalize a specific game design
language—an approach that is both daunting and perhaps premature—we’ve
chosen to look at the building blocks of games themselves: the mechanisms
or, if you prefer, the mechanics, as they’re also frequently called by gamers.
(We’ll use the terms interchangeably through this book.)
The second-best piece of advice any new designer gets is to play more games.
(The first piece of advice, by the way, is to create a physical prototype as quickly
as possible.) Playing more games helps designers learn and grow by seeing, firsthand, a large variety of possible game experiences and mechanics. This is no
different than any other creative fields: every artist is enriched by experiencing
the art and craft of other creators. Yet games, like books, can take a long time to
experience, to master, and to fully appreciate, particularly for games that require
large player counts, have long play times, or demand many repeated plays.
In an effort to accelerate the learning process, we present this book, which
is a compendium of game mechanisms, grouped together thematically, that
map the territory of modern gaming. Our goal is not to give a list of steps or
instructions for how to design a game. To use a cooking metaphor, this is not
a recipe book, but rather a catalog of ingredients, and how they can enrich
a dish. We define close to two hundred different mechanisms and variants,
spanning topics like Movement, Game End and Victory, Economics, and more.
Within each topic, we discuss how different mechanisms create different player
experiences, what types of games these mechanisms give rise to, common pitfalls
in implementing them, and even some of the physical user-interface issues raised
by these mechanisms. With each mechanism, we present illustrative examples
and games for further study, running the gamut from modern classics to
contemporary new releases, as well as some lesser-known titles that nonetheless
have much to teach. A good resource for learning more about the included
examples is the website, BoardGameGeek.com, which contains a massive game
database featuring images and rulebooks that can assist in further inquiry.

Introduction

Our hope is that this book serves many purposes. New designers can
certainly benefit from reading this book and taking in many mechanisms
in a short period of time, but this book can also be used as a reference.
Whether you’re an experienced designer looking for an overview of auctions,
for example, or a gamer interested in exploring the worker placement genre,
this book offers an easy way to review the topic and learn more. We feel this
book will be of use to educators, students, professional and amateur designers,
and anyone interested in reading about game design.
As important as what this book is, is what it is not: a comprehensive listing of
all game mechanisms. Though we strove to be broad and inclusive, an exhaustive
compilation of all game mechanisms was never our intention, and is arguably
impossible. While we do brush lightly on topics like narrative, dexterity, and
pantomime, for example, there remains a lot of unmapped terrain. Similarly,
while we do sometimes bring in examples from war gaming, miniatures gaming,
classic card games and collectible card games, we largely center ourselves on
modern board and card games. These lines are certainly artificial, and we have not
sought to put forward a definition of what games are in drawing the lines as we
did. Rather, we are eager to look to a future that continues to stretch, experiment
with and reconsider what games can be in light of new innovations in gaming.
We also do not mean to imply in any way that the well of new mechanisms
has run dry. The opportunity for innovation in gaming is limitless.
Our intention is to make it easier for designers to learn to design, to talk
with one another about design, and to mine the existing canon of board
games for insight into how to design better games. We hope this collection
is useful and inspirational to designers, and we look forward to playing the
next generation of their games.

For your convenience, whenever we refer to another part of this book, we
include a chapter reference, presented as an abbreviation. For example, the
abbreviation ACT is for the chapter about Actions. A reference like ACT-02
means the second section of the Action chapter. This additional information
may be helpful to you in understanding the context of the reference, even

Game Structure

ӶӶ
The first choice designers make about a game is the game’s basic structure.
Who wins? Who loses? What’s the overall scope of the game experience?
Will it be just one game, or perhaps a series of hands? Maybe the game will
encompass many scenarios, with game-state information persisting from play
to play? The last 20 years of tabletop gaming have brought us enormous
innovation in game structures, with no signs of slowing down.
Game structure raises the question of what it means to actually play the
game. In a cooperative game, is the discussion among the players over which
action to take the core of the gameplay, or is it the active player executing
the action that is core? In games which limit communication, is the main
gameplay overcoming the communication limits, or solving the puzzle the
game presents? Designers need to be sensitive to participation issues in team
games as well, because the game itself may force most of the action over to
one teammate at the expense of another.
In this chapter we’ll consider both the traditional structures like
competitive and team games, as well as the latest ideas in scenario-based,
legacy, and consumable games.

Competitive Games

Description
A game with two or more players and a single winner.

Discussion
This is the most familiar game structure, the one we encounter as children
in games like Candyland and Snakes & Ladders. Competitive games still
make up the large majority of the market for tabletop games. They typically
offer a symmetry of expectations: putting aside the impacts of unusual luck
and skill, each player begins the game with a roughly equivalent chance at
victory. When this promise is broken, the game is considered imbalanced,
and may even be tagged with the label “broken.” As we’ll discuss later (see
“Variable Player Powers” in this chapter and “Variable Setup” in Chapter 6),
players may have perfectly symmetric factions and starting conditions, or
highly asymmetric ones. But in both cases, it’s important that the game offers
roughly even chances of victory to each player.
In many games there is an asymmetry which in-game balancing alone
can’t solve, like the first-mover advantage in chess or the service advantage
in tennis. Competitive games often balance these advantages through metastructures, like tournaments, that offer each player an equal number of
chances to play from the advantaged position. In multiplayer games, this
may be less practical. Instead, players may be offered opportunities like the

Game Structure

bidding in bridge, betting in poker, or the early alliances in Diplomacy, to
balance any perceived or actual inequities.
The promise of balance in a competitive game gives rise to a number
of related issues, like methods for determining victory and breaking ties.
Tiebreaking, in particular, is interesting because determining a winner in a
competitive game depends upon the game storing information that allows
us to decide who played the better game. For many games, this information
may not be available. Once we have to look beyond who scored the most
victory points, or who crossed some finish line first, there may not be relevant
game-state information that could allow us to reasonably determine which
of the tied players played best. And yet, in competitive games, many players
disdain a game that ends in shared victory. Experience-oriented designers
should consider that players tend to recall how a game ended more than the
rest of the play experience, and designers should seek to avoid an indecisive
conclusion.

Cooperative Games

Description
Players coordinate their actions to achieve a common win condition or
conditions. Players all win or lose the game together.

Discussion
Quite a few games call for cooperative play among players, including team
games, one-vs.-many games, role-playing games, and games with secret
traitors. These can be viewed as belonging to a hierarchical category of
cooperative games. Some might even include solo games in this group. For our
purposes, we’ll treat each of these as separate categories, and limit ourselves
here to “pure” cooperative games in which all players play on one side and
win or lose as a group.
Since 2008, when Matt Leacock released Pandemic, the genre of cooperative tabletop games has exploded. Earlier games like Sherlock Holmes:
Consulting Detective, Arkham Horror and Lord of the Rings laid a foundation,
and enjoy enduring popularity, but Leacock started a wave of innovation in
cooperative gaming that continues to reshape modern gaming a decade and
more later.
Cooperative gaming is notable because it lowers barriers to entry for a
game. Disparities in skill level can often make a competitive game a sour
experience both for the expert and the newcomer. Complex competitive games
can be intimidating to new players, and being coached by your opponent

Game Structure

introduces some negative play dynamics because of the misaligned incentives
of helping your opponent. The power imbalance between the players can also
create awkward social dynamics. Cooperative games put players on the same
team and help create comradery while allowing experienced players to help
teach both the mechanics and strategy of the game without facing conflicting
incentives. For many new players, cooperative games are not only a gateway
into gaming, but a mainstay of their ongoing consumption of games.
Cooperative games can broadly be placed into two categories: those with
an artificial intelligence (AI) and those without. Cooperative games with an
AI, like Sentinels of the Multiverse and Mice and Mystics, feature an opponent
or opponents that players must contend against, whose behavior is governed
by some kind of simple artificial intelligence, encoded by the designer. In
Sentinels, the AI is driven by a deck of cards that governs the actions of the
enemy villains and the players they will target. Mice has a simple algorithm
that players use to control the play of enemy figures.
Non-AI games like Hanabi, the revolutionary Antoine Bauza title, and
Mysterium, present players with a puzzle to solve, and some kind of limitations
of time, resources, and interaction that players must contend with. However,
these games have no villain or opposing force that drives the action and
actively confronts the players.
Another distinction between different kinds of cooperative games is
whether each player retains agency over their in-game resources, actions
and choices, or whether they seek consensus for all decisions, even if they
nominally represent separate in-game characters. We might call the former
game a partnership game, and the latter a collaborative one. In general,
cooperative games will tend to be played collaboratively unless the rules
specifically and substantially impede this collaboration and force players to
make independent decisions rather than build consensus. Examples include
limits on communications, time, and focus.
For some players, collaborative play contributes to the “alpha player
problem,” also known as “quarterbacking,” in which some player takes
control of the group discussion and decision-making and creates a negative
play experience by overriding other players. There are many possible reasons
for the rise of an alpha player problem, many ways that problem can manifest,
and a thicket of contributory social dynamics that are beyond the scope of this
work. While some players and designers believe that the alpha player problem
is a group-composition problem, or a problem of unshared assumptions,
rather than a design problem, some design choices will make a game more
vulnerable to alpha player takeovers. In particular, when all players share the

6

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

same information, and the game state is not too complex, the tendency is for
alpha player behavior to arise.
At the other end of the spectrum are games which cannot be taken over by
an alpha player. Magic Maze and others of its type make player communication
a game mechanism, such that players can’t freely share information or advise
one another on how to play. The Mind takes this to an extreme by forbidding
players from having any kind of communication about which cards they hold.
These types of communication limitations may be presented like any other
rule, but they don’t actually create a bright line of which conduct is and is not
permitted. Rather, these games can be played somewhat differently by each
group, with the precise contours of allowable communication varying by tacit
or overt agreement. This approach is deeply polarizing, and some players will
utterly reject these kinds of games or cast doubt on whether they are games
at all. That said, these communication restrictions have the potential to create
incredible experiences that connect participants to one another on an almost
mystical level.
Communication limitations are only one approach to preventing players
from achieving consensus-based play. Space Cadets, Space Alert, and FUSE
introduce a real-time element that forces players to make independent
decisions because there is no time for players to collaborate. Other games
attempt to strongly connect players to their roles, provide them with hidden
information, or make operating their roles especially complicated. Mechs vs.
Minions and Spirit Island both make it challenging for players to decipher
each other’s powers and possibilities. Sentinels of the Multiverse attempts
something similar by providing each player with a unique preconstructed
deck. Escape room games from T.I.M.E Stories to the Exit and Unlock series
sometimes bar players from sharing information too specifically as well. The
variety of challenges and puzzles these games offer, and even the various roles
that players can take in the solving effort, all help ensure that every player
finds a satisfying way to participate in the game.
Another notable trend in co-op game design is the conversion of onevs.-many, “overlord”-style games into co-ops with the assistance of an app.
Mansions of Madness: Second Edition and Star Wars: Imperial Assault both
introduced apps that allow the games to be played cooperatively. More
generally, games are being released with cooperative and solo modes alongside
competitive modes of play. Sometimes, as has been the case with Orleans and
Oh My Goods!, cooperative modes have been introduced in expansions to
competitive games.

The ongoing design exploration of cooperative games and their possibilities
is one of the most exciting and fruitful trends in tabletop gaming today.
Designers are encouraged to experiment with this popular and adaptable
game structure.

Team-Based Games

G
m
ase

Description
In team-based games, teams of players compete with one another to obtain
victory. There are a variety of possible team structures, including symmetrical
teams like 2v2 and 3v3, multiple sides like 2v2v2, and even One vs. All.

Discussion
Team-based play is an ancient human pastime and is prevalent in sports, classic
card games, and war games. Thematic board games that model some conflict
often have to deal with a bilateral narrative, whether in the conflict of good
versus evil like in War of the Ring, the eponymous conflict of Axis & Allies, or

Game Structure

9

the entirely fabricated battle between villagers and their lycanthropic tormentors
in Werewolf. Team games allow designers to faithfully recreate these two-sided
conflicts while making space for more players at the table.
Most team games assign players to one team or another at the outset and
allow collaboration and communication among partners. In some cases,
partners may share territory and resources, or even move each other’s pieces
around the board. Early editions of Axis & Allies, for example, featured
Commander-in-Chief rules to model the historical reality of coordinating
attacks by multinational armies.
Assigning players to teams in secret is a common trope in social deduction
and betrayal-style games. In Werewolf, the werewolves know one another, but
the villagers are left to deduce who is a fellow human and who might devour
them in the night. In Battlestar Galactica, neither humans nor Cylons are
revealed to one another, leading to intense suspicion and paranoia. Battlestar
Galactica features a further twist: team assignments are not static, and a
player might start the game as a human, only to become a Cylon in a midgame loyalty phase that can potentially reassign players from the human to
the Cylon side.
Some games support partnering at the meta-game level. In Risk, Diplomacy,
and many other games, the rules specify that alliances can be formed and
broken freely. There are even games that further encode these alliances into
the rules. Dune provides for different end-game conditions for alliances with
different numbers of factions, includes a specific phase when alliances may
be formed, and has rules governing the conduct of allies (e.g., they may not
attack each other). Eclipse establishes economic advantages for allying with
other players, while limiting the number of these allegiances, and enforcing
in-game penalties on betrayers. There is a great deal of fluidity between games
that allow for coordination in play and those that have explicit mechanisms
to support that coordination.
Another common approach to team-based games is that in which players
perform different roles in the game. This goes well beyond the distinct
player abilities common to many co-op games. Party games from Celebrity
to Taboo to Codenames feature one player in a clue-giving role, with one or
more teammates in a guessing role. This structure is especially suitable for
party games because of the concurrent play of the guessers, and the ability
for the game structure to support large numbers of players at any one time.
It also allows players to easily enter and exit from a game without negatively
impacting the overall play experience for other players.

10

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

It’s not just party games that embrace role separation, though. Space Cadets:
Dice Duel and Captain Sonar both use the setting of operating some kind
of ship to cast players as engineers, radar operators, captains, and weapons
specialists. Each player plays a mini-game to model their function within the
ship, and the broader game is the sum of these coordinated parts. Sometimes
these roles can be fixed for the whole game, sometimes players will rotate
through the roles every round, and sometimes the game itself will force
players to change roles. This last approach can be thematically interesting
and appealing to experienced players, but can be especially challenging for
new players, who can easily be disoriented when forced to change roles. It
also makes teaching these games much more difficult, since, in theory, every
player needs to know every mini-game before play can begin. Designers need
to take this into account, perhaps by reserving role-changing cards and other
triggers for advanced play only.
Somewhat less common are team games with more than two teams
competing at once. Skirmish games like Star Wars: X-Wing can allow for
these types of modes, but there are even more unusual examples. Cyclades
with the Titans expansion enables a 2v2v2 mode, and Ticket to Ride: Asia also
supports 2v2v2 play.
Team modes are fairly common in otherwise non-team games, and some
team modes are attempts to enable a 1v1 game to scale to a higher player
count. The aforementioned Axis & Allies and War of the Ring have team
modes, but players may simply choose to play using the 1v1 rules, and have
teammates collaborate in decision-making instead of using the formal rules
for team play.
Two other game genres feature partnerships. Card games, especially those
in the trick-taking family, are one. The other partnership genre is dexterity
games. Flick ‘em Up has explicit partnership rules, and many flicking games
like PitchCar and Caveman Curling are amenable to alternating play.
Another very popular game structure is One vs. All. This structure is
especially suitable for hidden-movement hunting games, in which one player
attempts to escape from a group of hunters, like Scotland Yard, Specter Ops,
and Hunt for the Ring. It’s also common in overlord-style games where one
player controls the “bad guys” and the other players each control an individual
hero. Conan, Star Wars: Imperial Assault, and Level 7 [Omega Protocol] all
feature this style of play. Fantasy Flight Games has converted many of its
overlord games into cooperative games by introducing an app to control the
overlord player.

Game Structure

11

What distinguishes One vs. All most sharply from other team games is the
asymmetric nature of the factions. In hunting games, each player typically
controls only one character, but the characters tend to have very distinct
abilities, and the victory conditions for the two sides are different too. In
overlord games, the overlord usually controls a whole host of minions that they
can deploy, whereas the other players control only one character. These games
can be difficult to teach and learn because players need to learn how both
factions work in order to play the game effectively. While the genre remains
very popular, that challenge continues to bedevil designers and players.

Solo Games

Description
A solo game is a game or game mode intended for play by a single player.

Discussion
Solo games can stretch the definition of what a game is, but solo games have
been around for some time. Patience or Solitaire card games, war games,
interactive fiction (e.g., Choose Your Own Adventure books), crossword
puzzles, paper-and-pencil games, word searches and many more single-player,
game-like pursuits are very popular and have been for years. What is new is the
explosion of demand, and supply, for solo board games, whether as standalone
games or as game modes in multiplayer games. Rather than quibbling over the
definition, we choose to embrace the variety and possibilities of solo gaming.
Solo games are closely related to cooperative games in the sense that the
player plays against the game system itself, rather than a sentient opponent.
Solo games can be considered as a special case of co-op games in which there
is only one player—and thus, no alpha player problem. While most co-ops
can be, and are, played solo, communications-based co-op games like The
Mind typically can’t be played solo at all. Cooperative Limited Card Games
(LCGs—a genre, i.e., a blend of collectible card games and deck-building
games) are very popular among solo players, and the dungeon-crawl-style
Rogue-like game seems especially amenable to solo play. Players can usually
brew their own unofficial solo game from these games, or from many noncommunication-based co-ops, by playing more than one position in a co-op
game, for example.
Modern solo design pushes beyond that basic approach to solo play. We can
classify a few kinds of solo games: goal-based, record-based, and AI-based. In
goal-based games, players try to achieve some goal, usually a Victory Point
(VP) total, within a certain number of turns, or a certain amount of time.

Game Structure

13

This type of design is most similar to multiplayer cooperative games. These
games might have an AI opponent of sorts, but typically the opponent is an
asymmetric villain of some kind, or even an entirely abstract process, like a
spreading fire in Flash Point: Fire Rescue. The AI is not an automated version
of a human player who competes as another human player might.
Record-based games are those whose goal is to beat your previous high
score. While this may seem like a mundane and dull victory condition,
some games have developed large solitaire followings, complete with ladders
and statistics that transform the game from a solo game to a communitybased meta-competition. Ganz schön clever is one example of this type of
game and community competition. Some goal-based games can also work
as record-based games, as long as some scoring metric can be captured that
adequately measures game performance.
