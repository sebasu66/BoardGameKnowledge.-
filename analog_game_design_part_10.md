adjustment, a new view of his circumstances, knowledge he did not hold before), or external – the circumstances around the character have changed and forces
a reaction by the character that is transformed from
before. These aspects need to be in place to make it a
story. Keith Johnstone’s circle of expectation specifies
additional requirements - whatever you introduce into
your story needs to be within what the audience might
expect in that world. Too many “unusual things”
make it too difficult to justify and pull together. Keep
the main thing the main thing – stay with the story!
The best template for checking to see that all of the
elements of story are present was developed by Kenn
Adamss of Bay Area Theatresports:
Once upon a time…..
Everyday…
But one day…
Because of this…

“there are no rules,” which seems
paradoxical, but by which they
mean that such larps are not
to have any game-y systems to
handle things such as combat; all
action must be live and real, and
the larp should be structured to
avoid situations, such as combat,
that cannot be readily handled in
a pure roleplaying context. Another rule is that all players must
remain in character for the duration of the larp, except in specifically designated “cool down”
areas, and that suspension of
disbelief must be sustained to the
highest degree possible.
An equally interesting larp
type is the “jeepform,” a style
pioneered by the Swedish group
Vi åker jeep (http://jeepen.org/).
A jeepform is intended for play
by a handful of players in a short
period of time, along with one
or more gamemasters, who often have roles to play within the
jeepform itself. Jeepforms are
shaped toward the creation of
story rather than ‘roleplaying for
show,’ and are often designed so
that characters emerge over time
through play – and often so that
the player of a character has only
partial input into the nature of
his or her character, with both
the gamemasters and the other
players able to establish things
about the character. As a result,
they tend to foster wild and rapid
improvisational roleplay.
LARPs are sometimes highly
structured, with characters designed in advance and with the
game operators shaping a pre-determined story arc; others are far
more freeform (and indeed, the

193

194

“freeform” is a kind of LARP,
characterized by a minimal rules
set and no predetermined outcome). Even in the most structured LARP, however, all conversations are improvised by the
players; and in less constrained
LARPs, the experiences of the
players are highly improvised as
well, within the context of a preestablished setting and tone.
The nature of digital games,
with their predesigned art assets and precoded capabilities,
make anything beyond the merest conversational improvisation
impossible (and that only in online games). The nature of boardgames, with their tradition of
formal and complete rules, also
mitigate against improvisational
play. But in roleplaying games,
particularly in their more experimental forms, the techniques of
improv have been enthusiastically adopted and extended to
create games that are artistically
exciting mergers between theater
and “the game.”

Until finally…
And ever since then…
The moral of the story is…

The first section; “Once upon a time…” and “Everyday…,” is the exposition. “Once upon a time…”: we are
introduced to the world and characters in that world.
“Everyday…”: we are introduced to the routines in that
world - what they do and what happens to them normally. “But one day…”: is the inciting incident – what
happens that interrupts that world and routine. “Because of this…”: are the consequences of that incident,
and the beginning of the rising action. The “Because
of this…” section can be repeated – consequences beget consequences. “Until finally…”: the climax, the
consequences reach a point that there is no turning
back. “And ever since then…”: is the resolution - the
climax has rendered a change in the character or the
world that will remain forever. At this point, there is
no going back to the world that existed in the exposition. The moral of the story gives one last opportunity
to tie everything together – to reiterate what was potentially learned (or not) and to justify the reason we
told the story in the first place.
Improvisers tell stories in many different ways. One
is from start to finish – from “Once upon a time…” to
“And ever since then…”. A scene is the story delivered
in part. Scenes can be presented as part of a greater
narrative (in long form, there are many scenes played
which eventually all relate to each other) or they can
exist as a very small glimpse into a world at any given time and place. As stated earlier,
improvisers need to communicate to each other the basic parameters of the circumstances,
CROW (Character, Relationship, Objective, and Where), in order to have a scene. In addition
to CROW, all scenes have these characteristics in common.
• They usually start in the middle (In media res). Scenes usually don’t start with “Once
upon a time…,” we are usually thrust into the middle of a relationship, an event, a
problem, a place, etc, but we don’t know initially how we got there. Furthermore, we
don’t always see the resolution in the scene. Improvised scenes don’t take the time to
go through the entire exposition. Improvisers become adept at giving us just enough
information to let us know what is about to change in the scene.
• The story can only be shared a moment at a time. Actors work very hard to take
the actions and dialogue of a character within a given story and make them real – as
though they are truly happening in that moment, not replicated. Because improvisers do not use a text, they have to pay closer attention to the moment they are in and
react to each other and what is offered – everything is unfolding at the same time –

The Study of Tabletop Games

character, story, needs, wants – so much information to incorporate. The only way to
manage this is by paying attention to what is happening in that moment, not worry
about the moment after. The result is a truth in response that is perceived as genuine.
These exercises help/force actors to stay in the moment.
Two exercises that help to achieve this are “Without a Letter”, and “Leave for the Same
Reason.” The first, “Without a Letter,” incorporates dialogue, the second, “Leave for the
Same Reason,” uses no dialogue, but asks the participants to be fully present in the moment
and by doing so, be fully aware.
Without a Letter. (from Keith Johnstone) 2 actors start at scene with CROW. They can either
initiate it themselves, or get a suggestion from the audience or the instructor. It is important
that the characters each have a strong objective. If I give the actors a suggestion, it is something like this:
Aa son comes home from his first semester away at university. His father or
mother is anxious for his return – proud tht he is following in the family’s academic footsteps. The son however has made a decision he needs to share with
his father/mother. He has decided to become a hairdresser.
The actors then get an additional challenge to the scene – they must perform the scene
without using a letter of the alphabet – say “s” (the letter should be a consonant – vowels are
too difficult). The result is that the actors are forced to take their time, and the challenge of
avoiding the utterance of a particular letter is seen by the audience as thoughtful, sometimes
emotion-filled responses to difficult news.
Leave for the Same Reason: (Johnstone) 3 players sit side by side onstage. Without speaking
to each other, they must make offers that escalate a situation to point that all three must leave
the stage at exactly the same time for exactly the same reason - without any of the players
leading the others. Anyone can start – i.e. someone might make an offer of a slight cough.
The others would accept that offer by mimicking that cough and exaggerating it slightly.
This game teaches the importance of careful nonverbal listening which relies heavily on the
player’s periphery. It also emphasizes the importance of accepting offers and taking your
time in figuring out what’s going on. And it emphasizes very clear moment to moment
acting (seeing what happens next) with rising stakes, careful listening and observing, and
finally, accepting offers and building on them.
Both of these games force the improvisers to move forward slowly and more carefully
than they might otherwise. When improvisers slow down and pay attention to moment
to moment actions and reactions, the result is very real and satisfying – what improvisers
often refer to as a moment of truth. A moment of truth is an empathic connection through
a specific incident in a story. These moments of truth are the moments that elicit a reaction
from the audience – whether it’s laughter, a gasp, or a sigh doesn’t matter, it’s a recognition
that something has happened. Satisfying stories are created by evoking moments of truth
within the audience. A moment of truth does not have to be profound. Moments of truth
can occur at any time during a story. Sometimes the greatest realizations occur in the details
of everyday life.
In improvisational theater, moments of truth, from the most profound to the most simplistically humorous, are the goal of each story, and CROW (Character, Relationship, Objective, and Where) is the foundation - the rules - towards achieving these moments. So the
above all leads us back to CROW, the building blocks of a scene, or what do we need to know
to move forward.

196

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

While the rules, assumptions, offers and saying yes define the process of how we are to
tell stories as a group, we also need to name what we need to know with CROW. Characters
are the people in the scene – they are defined by external characteristics as well as internal
characteristics - how they more through space, what they say and do, and how those things
define their personalities and psychological makeup. The characters have relationships to
each other. Relationships can take many forms – familial, professional, etc. Relationship is
the most important component to name as quickly as possible – it is always more interesting
for characters to know each other. And all characters have objectives. An objective is what
the character wants. An objective is either a physical or a psychological goal, and is crucial
to the creation of satisfying stories. Objectives should be thought of as verbs, and must lead
to action.
A simple physical objective may be something as basic as, “to take a single step.” A complex, physical objective consists of several simple objectives and may be something such as,
“to follow the yellow brick path to its end.” A psychological objective will add a layer of inner significance, such as “to follow the yellow brick road in order to find a way back home.”
Through layering and mixing complexities, these kinds of objectives become critical to
creating satisfying stories. The physical objectives can be made more dynamic with the
addition of psychological components. The psychological objectives can be made more concrete by adding physical goals. An objective that is moving and motivated, active and attractive, and grounded in story will resonate.
All objectives in a story should lead toward the achievement of the overarching character
objective. This is the single most important objective that carries a character through the
story. The overarching objective helps to structure most smaller physical and emotional objectives. It is not always apparent and does not always take precedence over the immediate
objectives. However, it will constantly come back into play and often times acts as a framework for the lower level objectives.
To help us wrap up, here are two games that help to define and understand objective:
Outta that chair. A game to teach objective. One person sits in a chair. One by one improvisers enter with one objective - to get the person out of the chair and take their place. The
person in the chair also has an objective - to stay in the chair. Any offer is legitimate, so long
as the improviser doesn’t threaten or use force. To stay in the chair, the person needs to reply
with a compelling response to the offer on why he/she must remain. If they cannot come up
with a compelling reason to stay, they must leave.
Red Light Green Light A classic children’s game. Divide a group in half - one half watches
while the other plays. One player (the light) stands at the opposite side of the room - the rest
of the group starts behind a line. When the player turns his or her back to the group and
says, “Green light,” the group can move forward. When the player turns back and looks
directly at the group and says, “Red light,” the group must freeze in place. The player as the
light determines what constitutes “freezing.” If the person catches anyone moving, they will
be sent back to the original spot behind the line. The objective of the game is to be the first
to reach the player (light) without getting caught, tag them, and take their place. Variations:
Players proceed as partners - linked up with one or two others – and they must be connected
(touching) at all times. Players can also proceed as one group (all touching). Metaphorically,
the game follows classic story structure. If the playing area is divided into three sections,
each section represents how the emotional stakes change while working to achieve the objective. Using story structure terms and Kenn Adams’s story spine, the first segment is the

The Study of Tabletop Games

Exposition (“Once upon a time...” and “Everyday...”) The players are testing their space, the
objective is far off, the player as the light is comfortable, and far from getting caught, and
the audience (the group watching) is getting to know the players. The attitude is carefree
and fun - loose body movements and low commitment. The emotional stakes are low. The
middle section is the Inciting incident and the beginning of the rising action (“But one day...”
and “Because of this...”). The consequences for getting caught are greater, so the emotional
stakes become higher. The players become more serious, more committed - body movements
become more balanced and rigid, and the audience begins to look for the potential “winners.” The player as the light starts to become more “paranoid,” watching more closely and
even stepping back some. The third segment picks up at the end of the rising action and up
to the climax (“Because of this...” and “Until finally...”). The climax is the actual tagging of
the player as the light. Substitute “characters” and story situations (teacher/students, guard/
prisoners) to explicate further. The theme of justice also emerges.
The last element of CROW is Where. Where is defining the space. There are several ways
to communicate the where. The simplest is to ask the audience where you are. Or you can
name it in the dialogue, or you can show it by creating and using a object that would exist in
the location, or you can create sound effects that give clues and give actors an opportunity to
react, or add music as a soundscape (live musicians are best), and so on. Defining where you
are is the easiest way to begin a scene – you suddenly have a wealth of possible expectations
and activities that could be useful.
These are the basic principles that create the paradigm of improvisational acting. Building on these principles, improv goes in many different directions.; from comedy-based, to
serious, to short games and short form (scenes), to long form and full narratives. The interactions change constantly according to the groups of improvisers, but the principles and rules
remain the same. Like a hundred variations on Scrabble or any role playing game, improv is
at its core a fluid experience focused on the present time, in other words, play. Which brings
us back to the relationship of improvisational acting to tabletop games. Play is what we do
in both. We play in groups with clear goals and parameters, and while the results of our play
are not exactly quantifiable, they work parts of our brains that call us to reason in creative
ways. In the ETC, we think this is important, and so play is a part of our curriculum. Not
only do we create better teams, we create leaders who know how to problem solve in real
time and to be comfortable with what they don’t know, rather than clinging desperately to
what they do. Improv naturally produces risk takers and innovative thinkers who work well
with others, and it provides a performative perspective on how we can best play well with
others, whether it’s on the stage or around the table.

and was a high school teacher and then a technical writer before joining Games & Puzzles
magazine in 1972 as a contributor and subsquent editor. He has been inventing games since
childhood and has always delighted in recreational mathematics. Involvement with Games
& Puzzles led to the first of many books on games, especially card games, that he has written
down the years, and to the invention of his first and most successful game, Hare & Tortoise,
which was first published in 1974, won the first ever German Game of the Year award in
1979, and has been in constant production ever since. His best-known books are The Penguin
Book of Card Games (1979, latest edition 2008), The Oxford Guide to Card Games (aka A History of
Card Games, 1991) and The Oxford History of Board Games (1999). His advice is often sought on
the staging of historic games in period films and dramas. An active member of the International Board Games Studies Association, he has written many papers on the historical and

Lewis Pulsipher
Dr. Lew Pulsipher started playing boardgames more than 50 years ago. He designed his
own games, then discovered strategic “realistic” gaming with early Avalon Hill wargames,
and ultimately earned a Ph.D. in military and diplomatic history at Duke University. His
first commercial title was published in 1978. He is designer of Britannia, Dragon Rage, Valley
of the Four Winds, Swords and Wizardry, and Diplomacy Games & Variants.
After a 20 year hiatus from game design to teach himself computing and work as a programmer and chief of PC support at a major Army medical center, Lew has come back to
designing games. Britannia (2nd edition) appeared in 2006, with foreign editions (German,
French, Spanish, Hungarian) in 2008. Britannia is among the games covered in the book
Hobby Games: The 100 Best, edited by James Lowder. It was described in an Armchair General online review of a 2006 edition as “ready to continue on as one of the great titles in the
world of games”. Players of Britannia, a strategically deep, four-player game depicting the
history of Great Britain from the Roman invasion to the Norman Conquest, play primarily for
entertainment, but some schools use it to teach Dark Ages history. Other games are forthcoming, among them an abstract boardgame from Mayfair Games.
