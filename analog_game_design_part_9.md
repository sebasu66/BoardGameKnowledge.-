Not only do tabletop boardgames encourage or require that players engage in computational thinking, but they require that players talk about their computational thinking and
engage in the social aspects of computational literacy. In fact, boardgames, rather than being
self-learning environments, can be excellent collaborative learning environments (Berland
& Lee, 2010; Zagal, Rick, & Hsi, 2006). They share myriad characteristics with environments
that “foster communities of learners” (Brown, 1992); such environments have been shown to
be an effective way to support learning complex content. That is, they:
• Engage a group of learners in solving a joint task
• Encourage learners to share information to move towards a unified goal
• Engage in a consequential independent task serving the unified goal
• Engage learners in reflection about the viability of their contribution
Furthermore, the experiences around strategic tabletop games share many characteristics
with the types of discussion boards that we see around multiplayer online games. (Steinkuehler & Duncan, 2008) detail the literacy benefits and the scientific argumentation styles that
occur with frequency on videogame message boards. Boardgames have a feature that much
of the literature on games and learning has not addressed in significant depth: this collaboration is happening in real-time, face-to-face, and it is self-motivated.
In a game of Red November (Faidutti & Gontier, 2008) that I observed recently, there existed an exchange in which:
1. A player proposed a problem with a specific rule.
2. Another player proposed a resolution.
3. The third player commenced reading the rules through the instruction booklet, pausing for collective analysis, in which:
• She read a variable number of words, pausing on any complex construction.
• Each person offered an interpretation of those words, based on prior evidence.
• The reader summarized the collective decision of the meaning of those words,
often revisiting prior rule understanding decisions.
This looks remarkably similar to the exploratory talk described by Mercer (1996) “in
which partners engage critically but constructively with each other’s ideas…” (p. 98) while
making their knowledge public and working toward agreement. This is one of the ideal ways
that participants can engage in collaborative knowledge construction.
Not coincidentally, it also looks like a hardware resource conflict resolution algorithm
(i.e., how a computer decides which resources need addressing). When motivated by problems requiring an algorithm to solve, humans can spontaneously generate algorithmic resolutions to those problems.

Learning & Implications
Much of the games or informal learning environment research has, contained within
itself, a question that appeals to learning scientists: how much of what people learn in an
experience can they take away from it? So, what are people taking away from these experiences? What do they learn when playing tabletop games that they can use in other aspects
of their lives?
• Players are not only learning to think computationally, but they are learning tools
with which to communicate computational concepts. Social and cognitive computational literacy skills are most likely an effective “preparation for future learning” of
material computational literacy (Bransford & Schwartz, 1999). That is, while students
may not be able to program upon gaining boardgame skills, they have a framework on
which to build those skills, and; as such, will likely do so more robustly.
• Expert boardgamers become boardgame designers. Harel & Papert (1990) show that
when engaging students/players as teachers/designers, the students learn much more
effectively. They are forced to think through their design decisions and the implications of rule changes. I suggest that strategic tabletop games encourage this type of
decision-making. In fact, expert boardgamers often edit the rules of a game fluidly,
communicate those changes to other expert gamers, and understand how to best implement those changes. As there is no overhead to changing a boardgame’s rules – you
simply say the changes aloud – it has become very common among expert gamers.
In an informal survey of frequent gamers, most of them adapt the rules – if sometimes only slightly – of every single strategic boardgame that they routinely play. As
such, boardgamers routinely trend towards game design, which is itself a key mode
of learning computational literacy.
Conclusions
Though I have no evidence for it, I would suggest that the spread of the modern strategic
boardgame in the US became possible only after the spread of broadband access and computer use. All material technology for these games has existed for upwards of two hundred
years at a relatively low cost; it is the form of cognition that was not immediately available.
These games only became fun to Americans when they became better prepared to “think
like computers,” if only at a surface level.
This essay has shown how playing through tabletop boardgames can turn us into more
expert computational thinkers, and how it can make us more computationally literate (without ever touching a computer). The benefit of deeper computational thinking is relatively
clear: it gives us a new way to think about hard problems. Having these new ways to think
about data, to work through problems, and to understand the world is undoubtedly important; learning to think in this way by enjoying oneself could only be positive.

BOARDGAME AESTHETICS
Greg Costikyan

Wittgenstein famously believes that no definition of “game” is possible, because so many
human activities are called games. This is nonsense, of course – but there is an underlying
truth. Because games are so diverse, players of one kind of game often have trouble understanding why players of other game styles enjoy them. As a trivial example, the players of
first-person shooters rarely enjoy board wargames, and wargamers rarely like shooters. The
aesthetics of the two styles are very different.
The problem of aesthetic diversity is true even in so restricted a form as the boardgame.
Even if we focus down from the vast universe of all games to the apparently small subset
consisting of games played on a printed surface by people seated around a table, we run into
a diversity of tastes. There are multiple boardgame aesthetics. My intention here is to explore
them.
The Abstract Strategy Game
Let us consider the serious player of Chess or Go. He (less commonly she) will have spent
long hours pondering the strategy of the game, quite possibly reading books on the subject
and studying games played by masters. He will have a conception of the game as a clean,
utterly non-random contest in a purely mental sphere. He is likely to believe that this is how
games should be – that games of this type are pure, cerebral, by nature the noblest of games,
and that the sort of froth that appears on the shelves of toy and department stores is degraded piffle, perhaps suitable for children, but unworthy of study by any sophisticated person.

The very abstractedness of abstract strategy games is itself a virtue; Go is nothing but
stones and a grid, and while the shapes of Chess pieces have historical value, the game is in
the forces they project, with their variable movement capabilities, and it matters not a whit
that one is shaped like a horse and another like a castle. The abstract strategy gamer is likely
to believe, with Parlett, that modern commercial games:
“...rely for their underlying mechanics on well-established formulae, the least imaginative being variations on a theme of Goose -- roll dice, move there, miss turn, get home
first. Being designed for family fun rather than for genuine game enthusiasts, procedural originality is irrelevant. They rely entirely on their theme for whatever sales
potential may be squeezed out of them, and their own makers do not expect a shelf-life
longer than the topicality of the theme in question.”91
In short, to an abstract strategy gamer, the very theme-ness of “theme games,” with their
reliance on thematic color, is a suspicious attempt to distract attention from the mechanics
and strategy of the game itself, which from the aesthetic of an abstract strategy gamer are
really all that matters – and a game that does not focus relentlessly on these elements must
do so because it is not really very good as a game qua game.
An abstract strategy gamer may find the occasional modern title that holds some passing
interest – a game such as Randolph’s Twixt or Tavitian’s Blokus that eschews theme for strategic clarity, and that avoids randomness in all its forms – but will view virtually everything
else as commercial dross.
The Board Wargame
The board wargamer is at heart a simulationist. To the wargamer, wargames are interesting because they portray the color and pageantry of the past; men pitted in terrifying and
bitter struggle – ”Compared to war, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance,” as Patton said.
To a wargamer, wargames are not abstract, time-wasting pastimes, like other games, but
representative of the real. They show history, or hypothetical conflicts that are nonetheless
grounded in a real understanding of military affairs and the complexity of combat. You can
learn something from wargames; indeed, in some ways, you can learn more from wargames
than from reading history. A work of history can only tell about the events it depicts; a
wargame can show the events, and give insight into why the commanders did as they did,
and provide the player a gut understanding of the forces at play and the factors that influenced the outcome.
To an abstract strategy gamer (or for that matter to a Eurogamer), the idea that the outcome of a game might be determined by factors that the players cannot control is anathema;
to a wargamer, it is a virtue. “No battle plan survives contact with the enemy,” as von Moltke
said. No commander can be certain of the outcome of any battle, or there would be far fewer
battles, just as there would be far fewer horse races if horse racing were entirely deterministic. To a wargamer, randomness is not something to be viewed askance; indeed, a degree
of randomness is almost essential in any game that purports to be a simulation. The easiest
way to represent factors over which opposing sides have no control is with the roll of dice.
Sometimes, indeed, this means that one player or another wins “by luck,” something that an
abstract strategy gamer would find intolerable – but a wargamer shrugs it off. C’est la guerre.
In other words, one of the chief aesthetic values of the wargame is its value as a simulation; a wargamer understands that there is sometimes a tradeoff between the “playability”
of the game (its value as a game qua game) and its “accuracy” (its value as a simulation), and

The Study of Tabletop Games

accepts this tradeoff as a necessary part of the genre – but a wargamer will tolerate, and even
appreciate, a game that fans of other game styles might view as mechanically or strategically
uninteresting, so long as it imparts an accurate and insightful understanding of the conflict
it simulates.
To a wargamer, complexity is understood as a requirement of simulation. Complexity
is not a virtue in itself; if two systems, one simple and one complicated, simulate the same
things equally well, the simple is preferable. But complexity does not daunt the wargamer;
wargames are the most complex tabletop games of all, and a wargamer may take a macho pride in his ability to master even the most complicated of systems. A Eurogamer may
blanch at rules of more than a dozen pages, but the wargamer assumes that any game with
fewer is simplistic, in all likelihood a poor simulation, even if perhaps an enjoyable game.
The wargamer may play it, just as he may play Lamorisse’s Risk, but knows full well that this
is not, by his standards, a real game.
Games such as Chess and Go are, to a wargamer, musty relics from an almost prehistoric
past – suitable enough mental challenges, no doubt, but devoid of color or any intrinsic interest. Supposedly Chess began as a sort of simulation, and supposedly Go teaches something
about the strategy of maneuver, but they are so far divorced from anything real as to lose all
meaning. The players of abstract strategy games learn nothing from them, other than how
better to play a game – and what, ultimately, is the virtue in that?
And the Eurogame is hardly any better. Eurogames are completely divorced from their
themes, the mechanics shaped for the demands of their market rather than by the demands
of simulation. You can take a Eurogame and reskin the theme entirely, and it would be no
different; by contrast, if you take say, a World War II game and reskin it as Napoleonic, the
players will at once realize that something is amiss. Armor does not play the same role as
cavalry. The concerns of commanders in the two eras are quite different. It will be quite a
strange Napoleonic game indeed.
Despite the complexity of the games he plays, and despite their inherently strategic nature, the wargamer is paradoxically less concerned with the kind of strategy that abstract
strategy gamers and Eurogamers find essential. In a European Theater of Operations game,
there are really only two strategies for the German player – Russia first, or Britain first. The
wargamer doesn’t care, so long as that is realistic. The game is in the execution, and in the
simulation’s portrayal of the real, not in the ponderous pondering of strategy and goals that
are typical of more deeply strategic games.
The Eurogame
The Eurogame is so called because the instances to which most gamers are exposed were
first published in Germany. Paradoxically, however, the game style owes its origins to games
published by the American conglomerate, 3M, in the 1960s – the fabled 3M games, in which
Sid Sackson and Alex Randolph, acknowledged by Eurogame designers as the inspiration of
their form, came to prominence.
Like abstract strategy gamers, Eurogamers prize strategic depth; if you listen to Eurogamers talk, again and again you will hear the phrase “interesting choices.” They expect
games that provide a limited number of options each time the player has an opportunity to
act, but which make deciding among those options interesting, and non-trivial. If the best
option is obvious, there’s really no choice at all; but for the choice to be meaningful, there
must be ramifications expanding from it. Choosing one option closes off some avenues and
opens others. This requires a system of sufficient complexity, with a degree of uncertainty in
terms of outcome – and yet, perhaps paradoxically, Eurogamers dislike games where “uncertainty of outcome” depends on random factors.

181

182

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

This dislike of randomness applies only to randomness that can dictate outcomes; that is,
a Eurogame would never contain something like a wargame’s Combat Results Table. But randomness is commonly used in Eurogames as a way of providing variability in outcome, or
to break symmetry to ensure that players have different objectives or strategies; Eurogamers
accept this, so long as random elements either expose all players to the same opportunities
and disadvantages, or else confer no strong advantage on any single player. As an example,
distribution of cards at the beginning of play does not confer a strong advantage on any
player, so long as all cards are of equivalent power, but do ‘break symmetry’ by giving players’ different starting vantages.
In general, however, to a Eurogamer, as to an abstract strategy gamer, a game that can be
won “by luck” is by nature an inferior game – and if luck is a strong element, hardly worth
playing, and suitable only for children.
Eurogames are strongly shaped by their market; they are mass-market products in Germany, after all, if relegated to hobbyists in North America. An ideal Eurogame is played in
an hour or less and supports between three and six players. It has a low level of complexity
by the standards of the wargame (or by the standards of Ameritrash), but somewhat more
than is typical of the American mass market game (most of which are marketed primarily
to children). Ideally, it is accessible to fairly young players – many Eurogames are played by
families together – but rewards the intellectual maturity that older players bring to bear, and
the evolution of deeper strategic thinking by younger players.
The Eurogamer prizes clever simplicity; while he will not flinch at a degree of complexity,
he admires a game that creates strategic depth with a minimal investment in learning the
rules.
By and large, Eurogamers find games that pit players too directly against one another
disturbing; such games are “nasty,” hurtful, games that cause harsh feelings. Instead, the
ideal game is one in which people injure or aid each other only at the margins, where each
is building toward a win, perhaps competing for resources but not stabbing each other in
the back. They prefer positive sum games, not zero sum games. Only one player can win, of
course, and win conditions are necessary to motivate play, but winning should come from
strategizing more efficiently, not crushing your opponents.
Like wargamers, Eurogamers enjoy novelty. They consider themselves followers of an
artistic form, and often know the names of the game designers whose work they enjoy, looking forward to new works from these “spieleautoren”. They too typically have large game
collections.
Eurogamers enjoy the themes of the games they play, though they know the actual gameplay is divorced from the theme, that the theme is a mere marketing appendage on what is at
heart an abstract strategy game. They view games as more than their mechanics, but as objets
d’art, products whose art style, component value, and graphic design affect and inform the
experience of play. Just as digital game players have problems divorcing an understanding
of mechanics from the visuals to which they are exposed, a Eurogamer’s judgment of a title
may be as much informed by its production values as its actual gameplay.
For this reason, Eurogamers view traditional abstract strategy games as – well, historically important, no doubt, and undeniably excellent games in their own way; but curiously
colorless, without texture, and because they’re not involved in an ongoing tradition of artistic
evolution, less interesting than modern games. As for wargames – they are simply not worth
playing: far too complex, far too lengthy, nastily competitive, too random, and without that
tasty sense of strategic depth that Eurogamers prize.

The Study of Tabletop Games

Ameritrash
“Ameritrash” is a back-formation from “Eurogame,” and is used to describe games, not
all of them created by Americans, that hearken to titles published by Avalon Hill, Hartland
Trefoil, and some others in the 1970s through 1990s. Perhaps originally intended as insulting,
the term has been adopted with perverse pride by fans of the form.
Just as Sid Sackson’s Acquire – first published in the US by a US publisher – is among
the most “Euro” of “Eurogames,” so many “Ameritrash” games are by no means American
in origin: Hostettler’s Kremlin is Swiss, Lamonisse’s Risk is French (originally La Conquête
du Monde), McNeil’s Kingmaker is British, and so on. Ameritrash games are not limited to
these older examples, however; publishers like Fantasy Flight continue to produce excellent
Ameritrash games today, with titles like Arkham Horror and A Game of Thrones.
What, then, makes a game “Ameritrash?” First and foremost is a tight connection between
theme and mechanics. To Ameritrash gamers, Eurogames are oddly colorless precisely because their themes are irrelevant, mere marketing drapery for games of abstract strategy.
Ameritrash gamers like games where the mechanics emerge from the themes, where railroad games have a historical connection to the 19th century, where zombies eat the brains of
their victims and gain some game benefit therefrom, where goals are related to what people
in the situation of the game would actually try to do. Ameritrash gamers are not as fanatic
about simulation as wargamers, but think that if a game is set in the Stone Age, it should
have clubs in it. Obviously. Dinosaurs optional.
Ameritrash gamers like to plan and plot as much as Eurogamers, but they also like to
bounce dice. In real life, shit happens, and sometimes you roll snake eyes. Sucks, but there it
is, and you’re playing the game to have fun, not to demonstrate that you are the True Mastermind whose clever stratagems render all opposition futile. Ameritrash gamers don’t like
games with random, arbitrary outcomes, but they tolerate a far greater degree of randomness
than Eurogamers, particularly when the randomness is for the sake of color – random events
cards, for example.
Ameritrash gamers also like games with conflict – games where you go head-to-head
with others, where you can elegantly screw your opponents – where you can crush your
enemies, seize their cattle, and hear the lamentations of their women. They view negotiation,
trading, backstabbing, betrayal, alliances, and just general tabletalk as strong positives, and
find the “niceness” of Eurogames somewhat irritating. If only one can win, why shouldn’t
the game let you screw up your opponents? “Nice guys never win” – surely an American
sentiment.
Ameritrash gamers, like Eurogamers, are a kind of hard core; but because Eurogames
are designed to appeal to one kind of mass market, and Ameritrash games are designed for
a hobbyist market, Ameritrash games tend to be geekier. They often take multiple hours to
play, rules complexity is tolerated, and classic geek themes (sword and sorcery, space war,
monsters) are more common.
An Ameritrash game, like a Eurogame, is typically designed for 3 to 6 players, but has a
far tighter connection to theme, a higher degree of reliance on randomness, and pits players
more directly against one another.
The Beer-and-Pretzels Game
The phrase “beer-and-pretzels game” was originally coined by wargamers to describe
relatively simple, quick-playing wargames, the implication being that they were less intense
games with fairly simple rules that did not require extraordinary focus to play. Or sobriety,
for that matter.

183

184

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

It’s since been adopted by gamers in general to mean casual, short, fun, simple, easy-toplay games, often with light-hearted themes. You might play beer-and-pretzels games at a
party, or after a long and more intense gaming session, to relax. They do not require deep
thought, but may not be entirely devoid of strategy; and a high degree of randomness may
prevail. Classic examples include Rosenberg’s Bohnanza, Jolly’s Wiz-War, and Cayce’s Pit. Virtually all US mass-market boardgames geared toward adults fall into this style: Osterhaus
& Kirby’s Apples to Apples and Alexander & Tait’s Cranium, for example – no great surprise,
given the reflexive anti-intellectualism of most American adults.
There’s no real stereotype of the beer-and-pretzels gamer; typically, people who play
games like this are either hardcore gamers of one type or another, or people who do not selfidentify as gamers but are happy to play a simple, fun game for social purposes.
Beer-and-pretzels games tend to have a set of common characteristics, however. The rules
need to be explainable in just a few minutes, possibly to inebriated people. Turns must pass
quickly so no one gets bored. Humor – something virtually non-existent in Eurogames – is
common. There cannot be elaborate board layouts, because no one can be bothered, and in
the quick, frenetic action typical of such games, pieces would probably get knocked over
anyway.
In beer-and-pretzels games, fortunes often reverse quickly, with one move or the turn of
a card launching a trailing player to the lead. They often end suddenly and unexpectedly –
a stark contrast to Eurogames, which tend to build slowly and inexorably to the end-game.
Randomness, either in the form of cards or dice, or sometimes both, is almost essential.
Hidden information is common. Scoring never requires anything more than the simplest
calculation.
From a design stand-point, beer-and-pretzels games are actually non-trivial to create;
despite the “anything goes” feeling of the form, the games have to have enough depth to
encourage repeat play without a stiff learning curve, and need to be enjoyable in quick sessions.
Conclusion
From Metacritic to Boardgamegeek user rankings, people tend to try to cram all works
into a single scale of merit. While it is unquestionably true that some games are bad and
some games are good, it is equally undeniable that tastes vary -- and that a games-literate
and nuanced view of games makes such unitary scales questionable. For reasons both of
culture and personal preference, people bring different aesthetics to games, and the virtues
they find in the games they play are often quite different.
From a design perspective, it’s useful to understand what audiences exist for games; and
how diverse the form actually is. And while success can be achieved by catering to the aesthetic of a particular audience, games that break the mold are often the most interesting. Still,
it is worth contemplating what pleasures gamers draw from the games they play, and why
they enjoy them.

describing all modern games this way, but “games at the lower end of this market.” He is himself an eminent board
game designer.

IMPROV
Brenda Bakker Harger

While improvisational acting cannot be strictly classified as a tabletop game, there are
enough similarities to make it worth examining. Like a tabletop game, improvisational acting takes place in real time, requires more than one participant to be present in the same
room, and asks those participants to be willing to play adhering to an agreed upon set of
rules. Improv differs in that there is rarely a “win” state, there is usually no score, and even
when presented as “competitive” (i.e. Theatresports), it is always cooperative. In both cases,
the experience is ephemeral – it is something that exists for a period of time, then is gone,
perhaps to be repeated, but never in exactly the same way. What follows is an introduction
to improvisational acting – the basic paradigm along with several exercises that illuminate
that paradigm through immersion. Improvisational acting is part of the core curriculum at
the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon University. The students
in this program are not only interdisciplinary – 40% fall under the “Art” moniker – which
includes everything from visual arts – 2D 3D, design, drama, music, etc., 40% are technical –
primarily computer science, but also engineering, and 20% are other – business, philosophy,
English, etc…., they are also international. Improvisational acting forces them to reexamine
their starting points, creating a level playing field where they begin with an agreed upon set
of rules to create in a new way.
What is Improv?
There is a clear relationship between improvisation and games. A relationship that includes storytelling, story structure, character development, movement, team building, listening, focus, basic acting, and most of all a paradigm and heuristic that serve both the pro-

187

188

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

cess of game development as well the games themselves. Improvisational acting is a method
of expression through performance which brings participants to a common starting place
enabling them to put aside egos and create together. Most famously known as a comedy
performance vehicle (Second City, Upright Citizen’s Brigade, Who’s Line is it Anyway?), improvisational acting techniques are also useful in other applications. Improvisers learn through
playing games and exercises to develop a set of hard skills and soft skills that help them to
create. Animators can benefit from character movement and behavior exercises, producers
from effective team communication and idea generation, programmers from exercises and
patterns that can be replicated in code to inform A.I., game designers in the heuristic and emphasis on real-time problem solving. The hard skills improvisers practice include exercises
in the basics of storytelling – what makes a story, how to create a story arc, how do you build
suspense; in character development – what is a character, how to build a character from an
external perspective through body language, how that translates into personality, psychology, and archetypes; in the character’s objective – how what they want informs behavior,
choices and actions that further develop that psychology. Improvisers practice creating sections of story called scenes which are the building blocks and parts that form a greater story.
These blocks may be defined as CROW; Character, Relationship, Objective, and Where. We
need to know who we are, who we are with, what we want, and where it all takes place.
The soft skills (those more related to personal interaction and emotional intelligience)
practiced are in the form of listening to each other, of working in teams, of exercising spontaneity, of adding to each other’s ideas, and becoming great observers – all essential skills
for an actor. Improvisers use games and exercises to practice these skills. Because the focus
is on taking risks and exploring the moment to moment, improvisation allows participants
to once again access the aspect of self that creates in the form of play. In the ETC, all of the
first year students are required to take improv. The aim is not to teach them how to perform
(although many of them are perfectly capable by the end of the semester), but to teach them
how to use the skills they develop in improv in their future work. By placing the emphasis
on creation rather than performance, we are able to focus on the application of skills rather
than on achievement.
The Paradigm and the Rules: Why They are Important.
Improvisational acting and games both function by agreeing to follow a set of rules. In
tabletop games, the rules vary from game to game, but the need for all to agree to play by the
rules is constant. In improv, the rules will vary according to the focus or goal of the game or
exercise, however, there are three universal rules that all improvisers need to follow if they
are to move forward in their work together. These rules define the paradigm. The first rule
is: Be fun to play with. This means having a spirit of generosity, a willingness to share with
others and to not take yourself and your own ideas too seriously. It’s being able to incorporate other’s ideas. This is different than, “Have fun playing,” there are plenty of people
who have no problem having fun but are not fun to play with. The second rule is: Serve the
narrative. In improv, the narrative is often the story or scene that is unfolding in real time.
It also however refers to anything at all that you are working on that is group-generated and
outside of yourself. Your focus should always be on that – the narrative – rather than your
own ideas or agenda. The final rule is: Make your partner look good. Simply, if you are
concentrating on the people you are with and on helping them perform the best they can by
setting them up and supporting them, you will be keeping the other rules. If you agree to
this rule, you can be assured they will also be doing the same.

Making Offers and Assumptions.
Improvisers move the story or the game forward by making offers and making assumptions. An offer is anything an actor does. Period. An offer can be something an actor does,
says or emotes. An offer is a gift – early in our ETC Improv class, we play a game called
Presents. One improviser starts by making an offer of something that has size and weight
– they give this to a partner who treats it like a present and opens it, naming what’s inside.
An offer can be an actor walking on to a stage with a suitcase, setting it down, and looking
around. Suddenly the audience has questions. Who is that? Where are they? Why are they
here? Why now? Where did they come from? The actor answers these questions, a moment
at a time, but making small advances in her actions. She might sigh, or look at her watch, or
straighten her skirt, or her hair. She might be sad, or excited, or resigned. Everything she
does is an offer to make more sense of the narrative –
to move it forward. The important thing to remember
is that the actor has no more idea of where the narraIMPROV AND
tive is going than the audience. They are discovering

Like games, the player only has what is in front of him,
and has to make offers in return to move forward. In

encouraged players to explore the
improvisational aspects of the
milieu.
Over time, a number of independent movements have arisen
among roleplaying gamers and
designers to push roleplaying
games more in the direction of
theater; and indeed, in some cases the sorts of games these movements create are hard to distinguish from “acting games,” the
improvisational exercises some
acting schools use to develop actors’ skills.
One such movement is the
indie RPG movement, whose
enthusiasts often participate in
the forums at The Forge (http://
www.indie-rpgs.com/). In principle, any tabletop roleplaying
game that is self-published or
distributed in ways other than
the conventional hobby market is
considered “indie,” but the practitioners of these games generally
move in a “narrativist” directon.
The term “narrativist” derives
from Ron Edwards’s “gamistnarrativist-simulationist theory”
(GNS theory), which characterizes roleplaying games by their
tendencies along each of these
three dimensions. Edwards is
himself the designer of one of the
best known indie RPGs, Sorceror,
a game in which each player is
literally demon-haunted and may
perform powerful magic – but
only at the expense of losing an
element of his or her humanity.
The focus of narrativist RPGs
is on story-telling rather than
improvisation per se; but their
systems are often quite different
from those of conventional tabletop RPGs. In a conventional RPG,

accepts those parameters and completes the transaction by naming what it is. In doing so, the participants
are not only saying yes, but they are fulfilling expectations which were created in the initial offer. When the
expectations are not fulfilled, the audience (and the
participants) become confused. This non-fulfillment
can take several forms. Blocking (saying no), breaks all
of the rules. If the receiving partner names something
that does not coincide with the initial offer – a large
heavy present is a named a feather for example – the
offer is blocked. If I say you are my mother and you
reply with “I’m not your mother”, we have to stop and
figure out, well, then who are you? We are not serving
the narrative. The actor who is blocking also is not (in
this moment) fun to play with. Blocking in improv is
almost always done out of fear. An occasional block
will be forgiven by the audience, but too many will result in confusion and negativity. Another exercise in
saying yes is in a game where we describe a painting.
Three participants make statements about a painting
they see (of course, imagine) on the opposite wall. The
first person makes a statement: “I see a meadow.....”
The second person agrees to that statement and adds
on by saying “Yes, and...there is a blue sky above.”
The third person agrees and adds “Yes, and....there
are puffy clouds in the sky.” The first person picks up
from there “Yes, and....there is a large oak tree on the
left hand side,” and so on. Until the participants run
out ideas (never!), or fumble in some way - by hesitating, by adding “I think...” or turning the statement
into a question...or by saying Yes, but... instead of Yes,
and... Yes, but is the same as blocking. You “pretend’
to agree by saying yes, but you don’t really accept the
offer. Think about it this way; have you ever received
a Yes, but apology? I’m sorry, but … (endless qualifiers) It’s difficult to discern what is true. Waffling is a
milder form of blocking. A participant waffles when
they refuse to define something that needs definition.
If you receive a present and respond with “Wow! I
love this!” or “It’s just what I wanted!” without naming what it is, we stall the narrative instead of moving
it forward. Students learn to add to ideas rather than
judge them, an all too common problem in any kind
of group work – especially regarding brainstorming.
This does not mean that ideas eventually should not be
judged…just not before they have been pushed to their
maximum potential.

Problem Solving in Real Time.
One obvious aspect where games and improv are
most alike is in the need for real time problem solving. Problem solving could be seen as the basis of all
creative processes, the difference with improv is that
it is performed live in real time in a designated space
without writing anything down. Like taking turns in
a game, improvisers move the narrative forward by focusing on these three principles:
1. Use small amounts of information
2. Use what’s in front of you – you only have what
has been introduced in the scene or what has
been named explicitly.
3. You need to be present – Observe, Listen….and
go slow.
By taking turns, the improvisers ensure that no
player is forcing their ideas on the narrative. By going
slow, the improvisers ensure that they are incorporating everything that has been introduced. The audience
sees everything that is offered and is disappointed
when an improviser misses something that they – the
audience have seen. At the very least, students learn to
appreciate the power of details – in their stories, their
worlds, their pictures, their work, and their lives. They
also learn to recognize the power of the moment – how
an ordinary activity can become extraordinary by paying attention and committing to the action.
Team Work / Group Mind
At the ETC, the Improvisational Acting class meets
for two to three hours a week. For most of our students, this course is unlike anything they have ever
done before and for many it is one of the most difficult
classes they have ever taken. There are different reasons for this, but the primary reason is that although
they are usually extremely intelligent, they find that
they cannot rely on the skill sets they have developed,
or any book knowledge they may have acquired. The
best way to learn and understand these processes is
by engaging in them – in doing; so in improv, the students learn by participation. The class takes place in
an empty room – there is no power point or note taking. The students are asked to dress comfortably and
leave their belongings (and egos) at the door. For any
theatrical experience to succeed, the ensemble must
understand and be able to communicate the common

game systems are primarily concerned with determining the success or failure of specific actions
taken by the player characters.
In a narrativist RPG, quite often
the game system is used to determine whether a scene or confrontation is “successful” or not from
a player’s perspective, but with
players having great freedom to
narrate the events of the scene,
without additional die rolls or
the like to determine whether
or not specific actions succeed.
E.g., in a conventional game,
the outcome of a fight would involve many dierolls to determine
whether a character hits and then
how much damage he does; in a
narrativist game, a dieroll might
be used to determine whether a
characters wins or loses the fight,
with the players then describing
how this happens freely.
Narrativist RPG designers are
primarily interested in shaping
the arc of a story, rather than in
improvisation and roleplaying;
but this inherently produces improvisation and roleplaying by
the players.
Story games (see http://www.
story-games.com/forums/)
are
subtly different from indie RPGs.
A story game is a framework for
shared story creation; quite often
story games entirely dispense
with the idea of a “gamemaster”
entirely, instead providing a set
of rules for determining who
“controls” the narrative at any
given time. The rules tend to
tend to be more robust than those
of “acting games;” indeed, the
rules of acting games are rarely
described as “rules,” but instead
in terms of instructions from a

191

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

director or teacher. Because story
game creators emerged from the
tabletop tradition, they think in
terms of using rules to shape an
experience, and of modifying
those rules over time to improve
the outcome. Perhaps the main
difference from “acting games,”
however, is that players roleplay and improvise while sitting
around a table rather than while
standing and moving as their
characters would; story games
still transpire in the imagination,
not on a stage, and the characters
played may look nothing like the
players who take their roles. The
improvisation, in other words, is
primarily verbal, not in terms of
action and stance.
Live action roleplaying games
(LARPs), by contrast, make a virtue of physical performance as
well as character improvisation.
There are, however, many different kinds of LARP. One common
form is the “bopper LARP,” a
game, generally in a fantasy setting, in which physical combat,
often with padded weapons, is
the main focus of the game. Even
in such games, however, costuming and adopting a persona, remaining in character, are considered important.
At the opposite end of the
spectrum is the Dogma 99 larp
(http://fate.laiv.org/dogme99/en/
index.htm) , a larp designed in accordance with a manifesto promulgated in 1999 by a group of
Scandinavian larpers. (In the Scandinavian larp community, “larp” is
considered a word in itself rather
than an acronym, and is rendered
in all lower case letters). One of
the rules of the manifesto is that

goal. In improv this is referred to as “group mind”.
Group mind is not all thinking alike, but rather focusing on the same goal – serving the narrative. Exercises
in group mind focus on getting the partipant to let go
of an individual idea and give themselves over to the
collective narrative.
Here are a few simple group mind exercises and games:
Pass the applause: Participants get in a circle. Each
person claps simultaneously with the person to the
left, passing the clap around the circle. It should eventually sound like one person clapping. This exercise
helps to teach and practice focus, clear communication, speed and precision. Eye contact is key to receiving as well as sending. Speed and precision help the
participant to ‘give up” control and be ready for anything - just respond. The game teaches participants
the importance of being alert, being present, and communicating clearly.
Organic Circle: The group stands in a circle. One
person offers a sound and a gesture to the person on
his/her left. The next participant repeats the sound
and gesture and passes it to the left. The sound and
gesture are accepted and sent on in one motion, so
each participant only repeats it once (unlike pass the
applause). I usually side coach (giving instructions
while they continue to play) to have the group speed
up or slow down or reverse the action. The sound and
gesture usually change - naturally - no one should
change it deliberately. This game teaches attention and
being accepting and open to offers made.
Who are we? What do we make? What’s our Slogan?
The group stands in “blob” formation - and answers
these three questions in order: Leader points to one
person at a time who answers with whatever comes
to mind in the moment. The questions are : Who are
we? (one person answers) What do we make? (another
person answers) and What’s our Slogan? (third person
answers). The rest of the group repeats the answer enthusiastically all together as though they are at a rally.
Repeat several times through. This helps teach a group
to work around each other’s ideas and the narrative
they’re creating together. A more sophisticated group
mind exercise is:
Counting to twenty as a group: The group can sit or
stand in whatever formation they like - a circle works
well. The group simply counts to twenty as a group,

The Study of Tabletop Games

one person at a time. If any number is said by more
than one person, the group needs to go back to the beginning. The group should count randomly, without
any assistance like forming patterns, pointing the next
person to speak, going around the circle, etc. The more
control any individual tries to exert over the exercise,
the harder it is to accomplish. This teaches a group to
be alert to each other and give themselves over to the
task together.
Storytelling Foundations: How Improvisers
Tell Stories.
Storytelling is key to almost all improvisation.
Whether a story is told from start to finish, or we see
just a glimpse of the overall in the form of a scene,
creating a narrative is one of the main goals. In order to tell a story, improvisers know that you need to
be very clear on the definition of a story. No matter
how you describe the structure, the principles are the
same. There needs to be a world that has its own laws
and properties. A character or characters inhabit that
world. Something happens that interrupts the character’s world; tension needs to build and continue to
build until something changes. After the change happens, the character continues in the world, but something has been transformed. Whether the character’s
transformation is internal (the character has an attitude
