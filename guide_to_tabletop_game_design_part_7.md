the card when reading a card, so make sure that it’s providing useful information.
Upper-­right corner: I find the upper-­right corner is a dichotomy. In most card games,
it is where the cost of the card goes, as it’s a good location for something that needs to
be referenced only once and then forgotten about. However, I’ve also seen it used for
the most important information such as attack values, rewards, or icons for set collection. That’s the great thing about card design: there are exceptions to every rule!
Left/right edge: Some card games use the sides of the card for multiple bits of information. For example, in OverPower (1995) stats for the characters (Energy, Fighting,
Strength, Intellect) are lined up along the side of the card for easy viewing during play.
The edge of the card can also be used to link cards together using colors, numbers, or
directional arrows.
Middle center: In almost all card games, the middle is where the artwork goes. Art is
a very important element as it gives the card its personality, helps tell the story, and is
the best way for a player to identify a card when sorting their collection.
Bottom center: This is where more detailed rules of the card go, or elements such as
keywords (terms that are shortcuts for longer concepts and rules), or flavor text that
gives the card personality or adds to the lore.
Bottom edge: This space can be used
for a variety of things, from colored
edges to help the player differentiate a
type of card from another to where the
artist’s credits or any legal jargon needs
to go. As it is the last thing a player looks
at, you can put “less important” (to the
gameplay) information here.
Lower left/right corners: Here’s
another common location for pivotal infor­
mation such as attack and defense values.
It helps if the player can fan out the cards
in their hand to see these values, much
like the upper-­left and right corners allow.

Back: All of the previous locations can be duplicated on the back of a card (bringing us
to 22 locations—­though using all of those might create information overload!). Card
games such as FlipOut (2009), Hanabi (2010), Sellswords (2014), and Uno Flip! (2019)
use both sides of their cards for gameplay. Remember, you are giving up secrecy when
drawing a card by doing this.

Let’s see how these areas are put into action! Magic the Gathering does a particularly good job
of utilizing as much of card’s space as possible. The following list describes how Magic the
Gathering uses various locations on a card:

■■

Upper-­left corner: The name of the card. This is important not just for thematic
purpose but for gameplay purposes as well. In some cases, players may play only one
card of the same name or benefit from multiples of the same named card. It also identifies your card to your opponent so that they may either look the card up or tremble in
fear from its arrival!

Upper-­right corner: The cost. This is a one-­time cost that the player must pay to
play the card. Once they’ve played the card, the cost (usually—­MTG is a game of exceptions) doesn’t come into play anymore. Having it in the top right deemphasizes it as
the player becomes more concerned with the content under the picture.
Middle center: A picture that serves several purposes. The picture tells the story of
the card, it makes the card look appealing, it gives players an image to associate with
the card (particularly helpful when trying to find the card later during pre-­game deckbuilding), and it visual separates the top information (name and cost) with the vital
bottom information that is used during gameplay.
Middle center left: The card type. For Magic the Gathering, the card type is important for gameplay as it indicates when and how a card can be played—­as in the case of
an “instant” card. The type also indicates whether a card is immune or vulnerable to
in-­game effects. Types can be used to synergize with other cards in the game. Think of
this new section as the “new top” of the card, which is where the player will be focusing
their attention during gameplay.
Lower-­left corner: The artist credit, copyright, and trademark.
Lower center: The gameplay effects and description. These are the rules that pertain
to the gameplay and using the card. Also in this text box are keywords. These are written in italic text to call attention to them. Keywords are shorthand terms for gameplay
concepts that might be too long to fit on the card. This is also where you will find the
flavor text. These short snippets of text help tell a story, create an image, or quote a
character. They usually have nothing to do with gameplay other than reinforce the
game’s theme.
Lower-­right corner: Numbers representing a creature’s strength and health separated by a line to indicate which is which.

Let’s not forget the card’s back! The creators of Magic the Gathering have expressed their
frustration with the back of the card. If you look at it, every card since the game’s first printing in 1993 has used the “Deckmaster” graphic on its back. I’ve heard some of the newer
designers of the game lament that they can’t change it because it would make newer versions
appear to belong to a different game, but I like the sense of continuity it provides. It says,
“You can use any card ever published for this game in your deck.” The back provides your
game’s identity, and it helps keep cards secret until they are drawn—­an important way to
create tension and mystery throughout the game!
Keep in mind that while this is how the designers of Magic the Gathering lay out their
cards, it is not required that you do it this way. I recommend that you look at several other
card games to see how they’ve done it. Then you should use what makes sense and be consistent in your use of the locations that makes reading and playing your cards easiest for
your player!

Card Mechanisms
You should already be able to see how flexible cards can be just based on their basic form and
the position of information on the card. Let’s dive into all the great things you can do with
cards to create gameplay!
Activation cost: This mechanism was first seen in CCGs and found its way into other designs.
It is a card that can be played only after the player pays a predetermined cost. For example,
in Magic the Gathering, the card Nezumi Bone-­Reader costs 1 colorless mana and 1 black
mana to be brought into play. Activation cost can also pertain to the abilities that the card
possess. In the same card, if you spend 1 black mana and sacrifice another creature, then a
target player must discard a card.
Auction: This is where players compete and offer increasing amounts of money or resources
to gain possession of a card, position, or some other benefit. Auctions are the basis of card
games such as High Society (1995) and For Sale (1997). There is also a reverse form of auction where players offer increasing amounts of resources to not gain possession of a negative card, as seen in the game No Thanks! (2004). Auctions
are often used as a secondary mechanism in a game and
are a great way to promote player interaction.
Bidding: This is a staple of cowboy movies; you bid by betting money (or some other resources) into a “pot” or common pool as a vote of confidence based on the strength of
your hand or as a vote of confidence in your choice on a
game board. Whoever has the hand that is revealed as
the strongest collects all the resources, money, or cards.
Bidding is the foundation of many gambling games such
as Poker, Craps, and Roulette but can also be found in
hobby games like Vegas Showdown (2005), Wits and
Wagers (2005), and Manila (2005). I’ve even seen bidding used for combat in 2005’s Beowulf: The Legend.5
Bluffing: Bluffing goes together with bidding and is at
the heart of games such as Skull (2011), Welcome to the
Dungeon (2013), and Sheriff of Nottingham (2014). You
might need to bluff because you don’t have a hand as
good as you need to win. Or you might want to bluff to
shake another player’s confidence and get them to
fold. Keep in mind that some players might be uncomfortable with lying when play testing a design that has
bluffing.

And apparently, 2005 was a popular year for bidding games!

Card as vehicle: A vehicle (plane, car, spaceship) is represented by a card that is physically
moved around the play space or gameboard. In Wings of War: Famous Aces (2004), you “fly”
their biplane using a deck of directional cards. Turbo Drift (2017) uses a similar system but
with race cars. This can be an inexpensive alternative to miniatures.6 A challenge I’ve discovered with this type of design is this: how many cards do you need to maneuver without your
hand of cards getting too large?

Card as terrain/map: Build a map using a deck of cards. In Thomas Denmark’s Dungeoneer
series (2002), you explore a randomly generated dungeon built from a deck of cards that
grows with each turn. The trick when making these games is to make sure that there are
plenty of connection points on the cards. You don’t want to accidently block your movement and not be able to expand the map. Other map-­building games include Oddville
(2012), 7th Continent (2013), Burgle Bros. (2015), Sprawlopolis (2018), Undaunted: North
Africa (2019), and Diamonds & Dinosaurs (2023).
Using tiles instead of cards is extremely popular in these types of map-­building games from
Carcassonne (2000) to Northgard (2022).7 I find that using cards offers an inexpensive solution to cardboard tiles. With cards, you can create a larger deck that can offer more topographical variations.
Wings of War: Famous Aces eventually became the miniature game Wings of Glory: WW2 Starter Set (2012) as well
as becoming the foundation for several other miniature combat games including Star Wars X-­Wing Miniatures Game
(2012) and Star Trek: Attack Wing (2013).
7
We’ll talk more about using tiles as boards in Chapter 8 when we discuss Eurogames.

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

Card as a resource: Whether it is property in Monopoly, Sheep or Wood in Catan, or a land
card in Magic the Gathering, resource cards give you something to own, trade, or spend.
They may also be spent to create new, better resources. This action is called crafting.
Resources can be a great thematic replacement for money and/or points and adds thematic
flavor to a game’s design. Redundancy on your resource card doesn’t hurt; I find it helps to
have both an icon and text that describes your resource.
When designing games with resources, I have found that the more variety you have, the more
complex your economic system will get; therefore, I suggest starting with a low number of
resources (around 3 to 5). You can always add more types if your game requires it.

Cells/grid: This is a layout of cards—­either imaginary or printed on a board or play mat—­
that indicates where a single card or deck of cards is placed during the game. A cell indicates
where a single card may be placed or played. A grid is several cells and can be in a wide variety of configurations.
Chaotic rules system: The rules of the game and/or victory conditions change as new cards
are introduced into play. Often pre-­existing rules are overwritten by the new one. The Fluxx
series (1997) is centered around this mechanism. In Pitchstorm: A card game of pitching horrible amazing movie ideas (2018), cards played by the “producer” player deliberately causes
chaos to your pitch, which can be a source of hilarity.
I have found chaotic rules systems to be highly divisive as it does not allow you to plan a long-­
term strategy during the game, but rather to only react to the ever-­changing conditions and
rules. Use this mechanism with caution as it can make a game last longer.
Cutting the deck: This is when a deck of cards is divided into two different stacks and then
stacked back on top of each other to make a single deck again. It is often used as a method
to prevent cheating or encourage randomness in a possibly mis-­shuffled deck. An “I cut,
you choose” approach can promote fairness and is used to prevent one player from getting all the “good” cards. In this mechanism, a deck or selection of cards is divided into
two or more stacks of equal (or unequal) amounts of cards. The other player gets to choose
which deck to take.
Deck bottoming: This is when a card is discarded to the bottom of the deck, making it inaccessible. It can be used as a defense measure as with Lambert’s ability in ALIEN: Fate of the
Nostromo (2020), which allows you to look at the top card of the encounter deck and put it
on the bottom of the deck. In Fury of Dracula, 3rd edition (2015), deck bottoming is used
differently, to allow the Dracula player to draw more cards into their hand. This introduces
an element of risk for Hunter players who draw cards during the night phase.
Deck building: This is a mechanic that involves purchasing or acquiring cards during
gameplay and adding them to your deck over the course of play. Cards are dealt, played,
discarded, and reshuffled many times over the course of the game as the decks
­(usually) grow.
Many deck builder decks start with “junk cards” or weaker-­strength cards that are weeded out
(or “trashed”) over the course of play so that only stronger and more efficient cards are left
in the player’s deck. In the DC Comics Deck Building Game (2012), you must “defeat” more
powerful cards to add them to their deck.
Once you gain or buy these “better” cards, you can use them to create combos or cards that
synergize with each other, which is a great fiero moment when it happens. However, in
many of these games, the marketplace of cards is limited—­both in options and number of
cards available—­so that you must compete over the “good cards” for their deck.
The genre, which started with 2008’s Dominion, has grown quickly in popularity the past decade. Notable deck builders include Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer (2009), Paperback
(2014), Thunderstone Quest (2018), and Fort (2019).

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

Here are a few tips when designing a deck builder:
■■ Your beginning deck must be garbage: While starting cards must be useful, they
should be weak compared to the cards you can purchase. Deck building is about
improving your deck over time and the excitement that a good hand can bring.
■■ Drawing: Deck builders often have hand-­
limits (example, you may have a hand of
only four cards), so be sure that your design has cards that allow you to draw
more cards.
■■ Combos: Whether it’s a simple synergy between two cards or a super-­
ridiculous
combo,8 this is arguably the best part of deck builders. However, make sure that your
cards aren’t directed toward creating only one type of combo, but rather design a card
that can be used in several different combo plays.
■■ A trump for every play: While executing big combos are exciting, opponents must
be able to shut them down. Just as in rock-­paper-­scissors, there should be a defense
for every attack. Often these take the form of an “instant” card—­one that can be
played on an opponent (or off-­turn). Defense cards often require you to keep resources
in reserve for just such an occasion—­creating a wonderful “do I spend it now or save it
for later?” choice.
■■ Switching strategies: Because of the random nature of the card draw, often your
strategy will get thwarted or stymied by your opponents. A good deck builder allows
you to change strategies during the game. Can’t seem to cause enough damage to your
opponent? Try buying victory point cards for the endgame instead.
Originally a “stand-­alone” genre, deck building has found its way into other games as a companion mechanism. In Police Precinct (2012), deck building is used to simulate gathering
evidence. In Salmon Run (2013), your salmon meeple up a river using a deck of movement cards.
Note that “deck building” is different than “building a deck,” which is common to CCGs like
Magic the Gathering or Pokemon. Building a deck involves you buying (in the real world) and
assembling a deck of cards before the game is played. There is an art and science to building
a good deck, and how to build one is a topic of great discussion among the game’s player
community. “Recipes” of winning deck builds are often shared online, and the popularity of
winning decks rise and fall quickly—­often driven by the performance of a deck in a
tournament.
Deck depletion: This is a losing condition if you “run out” of cards in your deck. The classic
game War uses this mechanism, as does the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the
Runelords Base Set (2013) in which your deck represents not only the areas you explore but
also your character’s health. Dying means that you’ve run out of cards. Deck depletion is
also used as a game-­ending condition, as in Dominion, where gameplay ends when either
the supply pile of Province cards is empty or any three supply piles are empty.

A variant is deck deconstruction, in which you deliberately remove cards from your deck for
end-­game scoring, as seen in Valley of the Kings (2014) where you must “entomb” cards
for points.
Deck destruction is a variant of both deck building and deck depletion in which you start off
with a “good” deck of cards and add more and more “bad” things to it. Sometimes the goal
of the game is to remove the bad cards over the course of the game as in Flamme Rogue
(2016), and you need the “bad” artichoke cards in your hand to win the game in Abandon All
Artichokes (2020).
Deck topping (aka scrying): Look at one or several cards on the top of the deck and then
return them to the deck. In some cases, you may choose the order in which the cards are
returned to the deck.
Dexterity: These are games in which your ability to quickly or skillfully use or collect a card
determines who gains it. There are two types of dexterity games: “fast and chaotic” and
“slow and precise.” It’s best not to mix the two types.
Fast and chaotic is more common: whether it’s racing to slap or collect a card like in Slap Jack
(1930) and Dutch Blitz (1960) (also known as Nertz) or quickly drawing and discarding
cards from a deck as in Blink (1995).

Something to consider when designing a fast and chaotic dexterity game is that your design
should be physically accessible to players of all types. I used to play Dutch Blitz against a girl
whose arms were much longer than mine, which gave her an “unfair advantage” during the
game. We eventually created a house rule measuring the distance of the cards to the player
to make sure that no single player has an advantage over the others during play.

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

“Slow and precise” gameplay can be found in Wok on Fire (2015) where you flip cards (using a
spatula-­card) to reveal point-­scoring icons and in Super Rhino Hero (2017) where you build
a skyscraper of cards for your superhero to climb.
Again, accessibility is the key to dexterity games. Consider including some sort of implement
to help players with poor motor skills or including a way to rotate the play space or allow
players a way to maneuver around the table without upsetting the game.
Discard: One of the fundamentals of card games, this is when you must discard a card from
your hand or an in-­play card for one or more of the following reasons:
■■ As a penalty indicated on another card or by a game condition
■■ To maintain a specific hand limit
■■ To be replaced by another card that comes into play
■■ To indicate the start or end of your turn
Believe it or not, there is a big difference between whether you draw a card at the beginning of
your turn versus drawing a card at the end of your turn. Drawing a card at the beginning
of a turn feels like a “fresh start,” which gives you new resources to consider and can contribute to a change in fortune. However, it slows down the game as you must read these new
cards and consider how they will affect your turn.
I prefer that a player draw a card at the end of a turn; this gives you time to read the new
options that the new cards give you during “downtime.” They replenish an empty hand, and
they are a good indicator to the other players that you are “done.” However, during play testing, I have found some players forget to draw cards at the end of their turn. I don’t know
why some players have so much trouble remembering to do this. Maybe it’s because they are
“coming down” from the action of their turn that drawing a new card becomes an
afterthought.
Discarding a card can also be made of gameplay. How a card is discarded can be made part of
gameplay. For example, is a card discarded face up or face down? If the players can
select a card from the draw pile, then you will want it to be face-­up. A face-­up discard pile is
often called a stack. But if the discard pile is off-­limits during the game, then you will want
cards discarded face down.
In Aeon’s End (2016) when you run out of cards, you flip over the discard pile so that the order
in which you have discarded your cards is now the opposite of when you play them. Colt
Express (2014) does this as well when creating the action pile. It’s an interesting way for the
game to obfuscate the card order from the player and create just a little bit of chaos in an
otherwise organized system.
Magic the Gathering has a wide variety of abilities pertaining to discarding cards. For example,
if you play a black deck, you can draw cards from the graveyard (discard pile) to “bring them
back to life.” You might be able to “burn” a card—­discard it from the top of the draw deck to
activate an ability or gain an advantage. Other cards have effects that trigger only when
discarded, to diminish the pain of losing that card or to make an opponent think twice
about removing it from play.

Finally, consider giving players a discard action in which they can dispose of undesirable
cards to gain a better hand. You can let them discard, but at a cost, such as “You may draw
one less card than you discarded (with a minimum of one card).”

Doomsday card: This is a single card that causes misfortune to the players during the game.
Even if the players manage to avoid the card’s effects, it is reshuffled back into the deck to
eventually show back up again later in the game, giving the game a delightful feeling of
dread and tension. Doomsday cards are the foundation of the game Exploding Kittens (2015).
Several CCGs including the Yu-­Gi-­Oh! Trading Card Game (1999) has a variant of the doomsday card in which if you complete a set of (usually complicated) conditions, then your opponent automatically loses the game! The most famous of these is Exodia the Forbidden One.
Double-­ended card: This is a card that has a different effect on play depending on its physical
orientation on the table or play environment. Scott Pilgrim’s Precious Little Card Game
(2017) uses double-­sided cards, with different phases of the turn using different sides of the
card, while The Agents (2013) allows you to choose whether you want to use a card as a
“command” or as “points.”
Drafting: This term originally comes from fantasy baseball where players would draft their
rosters from an open pool of team members. According to game designer Mark Rosewater,9
this idea was adapted by the play testers of Magic the Gathering. While playing a format
known as “limited,” MTG play testers would each open a booster pack and pass the cards
around to ensure fair distribution.10
The first drafting type was “Rochester draft” or a “snake draft,” where cards are passed clockwise
around the table, and when they reach the last player to draft, that player gets a second
9
10

podbay.fm/p/magic-­the-­gathering-­drive-­to-­work-­podcast/e/1467994500
CCG players also referred to this activity as “pass the trash.”

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

selection. Then the cards are passed counterclockwise until the first player is the last to get
the final card.
Here’s an example of the pattern of a Rochester draft (if you have five players):
1-­2-­3-­4-­5
5-­4-­3-­2-­1
Drafting (almost always) occurs before the game starts and is fair way to distribute cards among
all the players. You are dealt a hand of cards, then after choosing one card and setting it
aside, you must pass the rest of the cards to the player on your left. This repeats until all the
cards have been distributed to all players and everyone has a full hand of cards—­most of
which are not the same cards you were dealt.
Since the MTG days, drafting has found its way into other designs: Through the Ages: A New
Story of Civilization (2015), 7 Wonders Duel (2015), and Citadels (2016) all use drafting to
evenly distribute cards. In Sushi Go (2016), the entire game is based on drafting cards!
Draw: The most common action in card games is often overlooked as a gameplay mechanic.
But when, what, and how many cards to draw from a deck (or even from which deck when
there are multiples to choose from) are important to the design of your game.
As we’ve already learned, changing the number makes a huge difference to the game. Do you
draw one card or two at the start of your turn? If you draw two cards, do you get to choose
one of them and discard the other? Drawing fewer cards during a turn makes them more
valuable as the number of cards you can play correlates to the number of turns you have.
If you want to keep a game short, give a player fewer cards to work with. But what if
the player draws a card that isn’t useful to them on their turn? It might as well be a
wasted action.
You might want to give your player more access to cards. Vampire the Masquerade: The Eternal
Struggle (1994) makes players draw a card every time they play a card, creating a flow of
cards. On the other hand, drawing several cards at once has its own problems. You will need
to read each card as you get them and evaluate how they will or won’t be helpful. Too many
cards in a hand can be overwhelming and contribute to analysis paralysis.
Another draw method is to draw back up to your hand size at the end of the turn. As mentioned, I find that this is a good way to end a turn, and you can spend the rest of your downtime reading the new cards and preparing for your next turn.
Remember, just because a player draws cards doesn’t mean they have to play them that turn.
Drawing cards can be an action onto itself, especially if the player can collect cards for a
potentially powerful play later in the game.
Push-­your-­luck is a mechanic centered around drawing cards. In it, you can choose to “keep
going” by drawing a new card to see if you reach a goal or improve your hand. This is the
foundation of the game Blackjack (aka 21) where players can keep drawing cards as long as
they don’t “bust” and go over the 21-­point limit. Dead Man’s Draw (2015) is another excellent push-­your-­luck game in which players draw cards and combine them with special abilities to plunder loot without busting.

Flipping/tapping/rotating: This is where a player indicates a change in a card’s state by
physically turning the card either vertically or horizontally or even onto its face.
For example, if you have a resource card that doesn’t get discarded when spent, you can rotate
it to indicate that it has been used and that it cannot be reused immediately on the same or
a subsequent turn. In Magic the Gathering, when a land card is turned to the horizontal
position, it is called tapping. When turned back to the other orientation, it is called
untapping.

For many years, Wizards of the Coast (MTG’s publisher) owned a patenti on tapping, which
prevented other game designers from using the term in their rule books.
That didn’t deter, prevent, stop designers from finding ways around this, and soon cards could
be “exhausted,” “activated,” “exerted,” “kneel,” “bow,” “charged,” “used,” “spun,” “booted,”
“locked,” “tasked,” and “tacked,” which definitely doesn’t sound like “tapping”! The patent
expired on June 22, 2014, and you are free to use “tapping” again.
Go fish: From the card game of the same name, this is when you request a specific suit or card
from another player, and if that player has the requested card, then they must give it to you.
But if they don’t, you must “go fish” and draw a card (or several cards) from the deck.

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

This mechanism is most used in hidden information games like those themed to murder mysteries; however, as a designer, you want to consider whether the player announces the card
they are looking for—­otherwise other players might hear and keep track of the request,
ruining the exclusivity of the information they just requested.
Hand: This is the term for the cards that are dealt to you, usually face down. These cards are
held in your hand to keep them literally “close to the vest” and kept their contents known/
visible only to you. The contents of your hand are usually kept secret from the other players
during most or all of the game.
There are moments when a hand can be viewed by another player—­either as an action to
require you to show one or all your cards or part of a deal. Some games allow for a show of
hands (or show), in which all the players reveal their cards to each other, usually for comparison purposes to see who has won the hand or game.
The facing of your cards in a hand can be used for gameplay. In Hanabi (2010), you hold your
hand with the card’s faces facing the other players. The other players then give you hints to
help you determine which card to play.
To make things more complicated, the term hand is also used to indicate the number of rounds
you play before the game is considered over, as in “whomever has the highest score after
three hands of cards wins.”
Hand depletion: This is a losing condition that occurs if you “run out” of cards in your hand,
as in Exploding Kittens. A hand of cards can also represent your “life,” and if you run out of
life, then you lose. You can also run out of cards in 5-­Minute Dungeon (2017), but another
player can help you by giving you cards.
Hand depletion can also be used as a winning condition, The first to discard all their cards is the
winner in Uno (1971), Phase 10 (1982), and Dutch Blitz (1960). In the classic game Karma,
the loser is the last to discard all their cards.
Hand limit: This is an artificial restriction enforced by the rules where a player may have only
a specific number of cards in their hand. If new cards are introduced, then other cards must
be discarded.
Hand limit brings up a thorny design question: “How many cards is too many?” Some feel that
odd numbers—­3, 5, 7, 9—­are better than even. However, even numbered hands—­2, 4, 6,
8—­lend themselves toward natural set building and melds.
Whatever the number, consider the concept of “handiness”—­how many cards fit comfortably
in the player’s hand. Unless the game is fast-­paced and allows for many cards to be discarded
on a turn (via meld or some other method), I suggest nine or fewer cards in a player’s hand.
Be mindful of the tempo in which new cards come into play. A player’s comprehension slows to
a crawl when they must read the contents of multiple cards and consider their ramifications
on their turn.
Hand management: This is when the number of cards in your hand is limited by a rule and
cards must be drawn, discarded, or played to maintain that limit. For example, if a game has
a hand limit of five cards and I have seven in my hand, I must discard two cards to maintain
the card limit.

Some games require specific management of your hand—­such as the order of cards held in a
hand—­as a restriction or victory condition. In Bohnanza (1997) cards are held in a locked
order, where the order of the player’s hand cannot be changed during play. In some cases,
the player may discard and replace a card in their hand, but the cards in your hand may not
be transposed. In 10 Days in the USA (2003), cards are also held in locked order, which represents a route the player is traveling across America.
Some players prefer to manage their cards to process information found more easily. For example, I always organize my hand of Uno cards by color and number.
Hidden information: This is when cards are held facing away from the other players so the
player cannot see what is on them as in Blackjack or when the information on cards are kept
away from the players—­who must guess what they are, as in the game Cluedo (1949). The
player must guess the value or identity of the cards to win the game.
You can hide the cards from players using a small envelope, or they can be stashed into a box
with other cards as done in the game Chaosmos (2015) and Charterstone (2017).
Hole card: This is a card dealt to a player face down and not revealed to other players until the
end of the hand. The player can look at this card, but it isn’t revealed to the other players
until the end of the game, creating a tense and exciting moment, especially if it helps win
the hand. This is where the phrase “ace in the hole” comes from.
Junk card: This is a term from deck builders that refers to a card that is considered almost
useless but is part of your deck at the beginning of the game. Junk, or “garbage,” cards are
meant to be replaced with better cards to improve the deck’s efficiency.
Market: This is a location on the play space where a variety of cards are available for you to
purchase during the game. This is a standard feature found in deck-­building games like
Machi Koro (2012), Space Base (2018), and Everdell (2018).
An important aspect of the market is the churn, the rate in which new cards enter and leave
the market. This can be part of the upkeep stage of the game, in which older cards are
discarded and new cards come in to replace them. A new card can enter the market when a
card is bought, and a new card replaces the one that was just purchased.

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

Other games have presorted decks that escalate in value and usefulness as the game progresses.
You must buy the “lesser” low-­value cards first to access the “better cards” further down
in the deck.
You may let players spend an action to initiate the churn. In Ticket to Ride (2004), you have the
option to clear the market of ticket cards and replace them with all new choices.
Meld: Most used in the game of Rummy and its variants, a meld is a set of matching cards,
typically three or more, that earn the player points and/or allow you to discard them from
your hand. Melds typically come in sequences of ascending cards belonging to the same suit
known as runs (8♠ 9♠ 10♠ ) or sets/groups of cards of identical rank (8♠ 8♣ 8♥). Other
melds that involve face cards are called a marriage (e.g., K♥ and Q♥) and bezique
(Q♠ and J♦).

A clever use of melds can be found in the game Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper (1998), which
replaces the face cards with story cards whose contents tell the narrative when they are
assembled in melds.
Ramping points: Players attempt to collect multiple cards of the same type or suit to earn
more points. The more cards the players collect, the more points they are worth at the end
of the round/game.
For example, collecting dumpling cards in Sushi Go (2013) earns the player 1, 3, 6, 10, or 15
points depending on the number of dumpling cards collected. If you collect one card, it is
worth one point. If you collect three cards, you earn six points!
Rounds: This is the number of times the game is played before being considered over. For
example, players will play three rounds of a game, calculate the score, and whomever has the
highest, wins. Rounds are often called hands, and in game theory, a game with repeated
rounds of play is known as a stage game.
There might be some sort of upkeep or change that occurs in between rounds that escalates the
stakes, increases difficulty, or even introduces new rules to the players.
Shuffling/reshuffling: In most games, the deck is shuffled to evenly distribute the cards. A
deck may be reshuffled to redistribute discarded cards, create randomness in the deck, or
change the order of any cards that might have been returned to the deck.

Some card games require the deck to not be shuffled, as the cards are presorted (usually by
number) in a way that helps tell the story or direct the gameplay flow. Good examples of
presorted card games include 7th Continent (2015), Fabled Fruit (2016), and the Fast
Forward series of games (Fear, Fortress, Flee and Fortune—­all from 2017).

Secret role/traitor: This is a cooperative game that has one or more players whose victory
condition is in opposition to the rest of those playing the game. The presence of a traitor
can be hidden until they are discovered by the others, revealed by the traitor themselves,
or held in secret until victory is declared. The goal of the traitor is to defeat or thwart the
other players.
This mechanism gained popularity with the party game Mafia (1986) but eventually found its
way into dozens of card and board games like Ultimate Werewolf: Ultimate Edition (2008),
The Resistance (2009), Secret Hitler (2016), and GROWL (2019).
Simultaneous action selection: All players select their cards in secret and then reveal them
at the same time. The act of the reveal adds some nice tension to the game. Outstanding
examples of this mechanism can be found in Twilight Struggle (2005), The Resistance
(2009), Libertalia (2012), and A Game of Thrones the Card Game (2008).
Set collection: In this mechanism, you must collect a specific sequence of cards (based on
numbers, suits, colors, icons, etc.) to gain points or earn a benefit during gameplay.
Set collection makes a great addition to your main game. Players can benefit by collecting sets
to gain points or benefits either in the medium term or in the long term of the game.

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

In Sushi Go, if you are collecting pudding cards, you score six points if you have the most by the
end of the game and lose six points if you have the least! Another great set collection mechanism found in Sushi Go is what I call the dumpling scoring mechanism, named after the
dumpling cards in the game. With each card collected, the player gains more and more
points. If you have one dumpling card, you score only one point. But if you collect two cards,
you gain three points! If you have three cards, you score six points! If you collect four cards,
you gain 10 points, and if you have five dumplings, you gain a whopping 15 points!

Stealing: This is when you take a card or resource from another player—­either as an action
dictated by a card or thanks to some other game rule—­like the robber in Catan. Netrunner
(2000), Citadels (2000), and Unexpected Treasures (2002) are just a few of the card games
that let you indulge in your naughty side.
Suits: In playing cards, a suit is one of several categories into which the cards of a deck are
divided. Most often, each card bears one of several symbols showing to which suit it belongs;
the suit may alternatively or in addition be indicated by the color printed on the card.

As we’ve already learned, traditional playing card suits are either black (spades, clubs) or red
(diamonds, hearts), but you can make your suit any symbol and/or color that you want. In
MTG, the suits represent the lands that the Planewalkers draw upon to cast magic spells
and summon creatures. The game of Sabaac (1986), which is played in the Star Wars movies
and novels, has suits of sabers, staves, flasks, and coins.
Just make sure that the icons that you use are large enough and clear enough for players to see
and identify. When creating cards for printing, make sure that your icons are at least a half
an inch large (36-­point scale).
Trick taking: This is a type of card game in which play of a “hand” centers on a series of finite
rounds or units of plays called tricks. Tricks are evaluated to determine a winner or “taker”
of that trick. The object of trick-­taking games may be closely tied to the number of tricks
taken or on the value of the cards contained in taken tricks.
Trick-­taking games have been around for as long as there have been card games. Bourré, Hearts,
Euchre, Spades, Whist, Pinocle, and Skat are all classic games that date back to the 15th century. I admit that trick-­taking games can be a little complicated to learn and understand,
especially if you didn’t grow up playing them, but more designers are interested in them—­
the genre has had a bit of a renaissance lately. FORK (2023), Twin Palms (2022), Cat in the
Box (2020), The Crew: Quest for Planet Nine (2019), and Fool! (2018) are all modern takes
on that classic style of game.
Trading: In trading games, the cards often represent resources or items. Players may exchange
these cards with each other—­either through goodwill, negotiation, or blackmail—­to better
their own position in the game.
Even though there are games that rely on and are more fun with trading—­like Catan or
Monopoly—­I find that players are often hesitant to trade, possibly because they don’t want
to give their opponents an advantage! However, another reason might be that trading relies
on surplus.

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

My logic regarding trading is this: you want to hang on to the first card. You also want to
hang on to the second card in case you want to use or lose the first one. It’s when I get the
third of a resource that I will start to feel comfortable offering it for trade to another
player. Players must feel like they have extra resources to trade to be comfortable trading.
I’m not going to trade my only card of a specific type—­unless it’s something I just
cannot use.
If your game depends on trading and you are finding that your players are reluctant to trade, I
suggest calling out and making trading a very specific step in your rules. Give the player a
benefit for being the first one to trade. Or make trading mandatory—­each player must
trade a resource during the trading round. If you can get players used to trading early in the
game, it will become second nature to them as the game continues.

War: Based on the classic children’s game, players compare two (or more) cards. The player
with the highest numbered (or face) card wins. If there is a tie (matching cards), then each
player draws three cards and rematches. This continues until there is a clear winner. The
winner collects all the cards in play.
The “compare two cards and see which one is higher/better” mechanism is often used in
other games as a quick and simple combat system. This is fine if you have a variety of
other systems in your game—­there’s nothing wrong with having a simple mechanism in
a game—­but I don’t think that War is compelling enough for modern players to stand
on its own.

Components
Ironically, card games don’t always just consist of cards alone. Designers often incorporate
components to augment their mechanisms. The following are some of the most typical components found in card games:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Chips are circular tokens, usually made of plastic or clay and are commonly used for
bidding in casino card games like Poker, Blackjack,
Baccarat, and others. Their value or denomination is
often indicated by the color of the chip.
Don’t dismiss the tactile pleasure that the player gets
by handling chips. The way they feel, weigh, and sound
when clacked together is a big part of their appeal.
Coins, both real and fake, can also be used to represent money. Many game publishers, especially those who produce games for
Kickstarter, offer uniquely designed coins as a popular upgrade. Again, players seem to
prefer the tactile and aural sensation that metal coins offer.
Coins don’t have to be circular either. I’ve seen a wide range of shapes and sizes and
designs being produced. A differently shaped coin is an easy way to add theming to
your game. If you are making a sci-­fi game, consider a hexagonal or rectangular coin in
lieu of the traditional circle.
Tokens are cardboard counterparts to chips and coins. The advantage is that they can
be printed in color and unique shapes using a tool that is called a die. Die-­cut cardboard tokens are an inexpensive alternative to metal and clay coins and tokens. They
don’t have to represent only money; I’ve played games where tokens represent health,
wounds, reputation, and even the mental state of the player. We’ll dive more into
tokens when we talk about board games.
Counters (also known as gems) are plastic, resin, or glass components that represent
the player’s position on a track, the number of “somethings” that a player has. They are
transitory components, ones that are meant to come and go as the fate and fortune of
the player changes over the course of the game.
In Yu-­Gi-­Oh, counters placed on a card can represent the card’s power, the card’s health,
or the card’s upgraded level, which is important when it comes to combining cards
together to bring out a higher-­level card.
Dice also make great counters (also called trackers), because they have a variable
numeric value that can be raised and lowered during gameplay. MTG players will use a
20-­sided die to represent their Planewalker’s health. These are commonly called spinner dice—­because they “spin” up and down in value over the course of a game.
Scoring sheets are a must if you are designing a game with scoring. These are used to
track the player’s score over multiple scoring rounds or if multiple hands of your game

CHAPTER 5

■■

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

are to be played. Don’t forget to include a pencil! (Or mention in your rules that they
will need one!)
A pegboard is primarily used to track score in the game Cribbage (approx. 1630). Pegs
are not commonly used in other card games (they can be found in board games like
Battleship and Mastermind), so perhaps there’s a whole genre of pegboard card games
just waiting to be created?

There are many other components that can be used in card games, such as pawns and meeples. I will cover those in later chapters. However, cards are an essential part of almost every
other type of game that we will be learning about from here on out.

A Note About Probability and Cards
We talked a lot about probability in the Chapter 4, but a deck of cards creates its own (and
very different) probability situation due to their physical nature.
As cards are drawn from a deck, the number of desired outcomes will fluctuate over the course
of the game. Let’s say we have a twelve-­unique-­card deck, and our starting hand is three
cards. Once these cards are played, and unless there is a rule in the game that allows you to
do so, you can’t draw them again. . .at least until they are reshuffled back into the deck, as in
a deck builder.
Waiting for those cards to “come back around again” is not very fun and not very strategic.
Therefore, most card games have duplicate cards that start in a deck, especially if the card is
important or even crucial to playing the game. The deck builder Dominion (2008) has players
start with several money cards because buying more cards is a main mechanism of the game.
By allowing the player to have duplicate cards in their deck, they will be able to do these critical actions several times before the deck runs out. More powerful cards are usually rarer—­
often one per deck—­to prevent the player from being able to do the powerful move
repeatedly.
You can also deal with this issue by giving your player opportunities to add cards to the deck,
draw additional cards from the deck, or even search a deck or “graveyard” of discarded cards
to reuse a card that has been previously used and discarded.
Just like with dice games, these mechanisms allow the player an opportunity to mitigate
the probability that the cards will give them more choices and create a more enjoyable game
experience.

Let’s Design a Card Game
Let’s design a card game for two to six players. For the game, you will need the following:

■■
■■
■■

Two decks of standard playing cards
A Sharpie marker
Plain white stickers (optional)

Step 1: Setting Up the Game
To set up for this game, do the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Open the two decks of cards.
Remove the Jokers and any instructional cards. You won’t be needing these.
Separate the face cards—­King, Queen, Jack, and Ace—­from both decks.
Organize the face cards by suit—­spade, heart, club, and diamond. Keep only one face
card from each suit. Set aside the second set of face cards in a separate deck, unless you
are playing with five or six players.
5. Shuffle together the remaining numbered card deck and set it aside for the moment.
6. Give each player a set of four face cards—­King, Queen, Jack, and Ace—­of each of the
different suits.

Step 2: Create the Rules
Start by writing down how to win the game. In this case, we’ll write the following:
How to win: Create a hand with a value closest to the trump card as possible.

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

Now write the rules for the game:
1. Face cards have the following values:
■■ King = 14
■■ Queen = 13
■■ Jack = 12
■■ Ace = 11
