Recursive Brainstorming and Lists!
Designing a game is a recursive and iterative process. Once I had a list of ideas, I picked
the four most promising ones, and developed them by generating lists of rules and mechanics.
From those, I picked the single idea I liked best, called Burdensome Hopscotch, which came
from the brainstorm idea, Make it difficult for your opponent to hop by dressing them up in crazy
gear. It appealed to me most because it had the opportunity for players to creatively prepare
for the game based on their own personalities, and the gameplay had huge opportunities to
be downright hilarious. The varying equipment would also change the physical mechanics
from game to game, resulting in a very replayable experience.
Now that I’d chosen Burdensome Hopscotch, I went through its potential rules and mechanics and drilled down again and brainstormed around each one of those.
This process may sound obvious, but a common design pitfall is running with the first
feasible idea you think up. Don’t shortchange yourself at any step of the way.
Burdensome Hopscotch
The gist of Burdensome Hopscotch is that before the game, each player rounds up ten items
that can be worn or held, and everyone tosses them into a heap. They should be things that
would make playing difficult when used. (The items most fun in playtests were: cleats, a
backpack of rocks, giant sunglasses, big mittens, snowboarding boots, winter jackets, a staff,
and a tennis racket, among other things.)
Each board square has a smaller target inside it. If a player lands their marker on the target, they get to draw a slip of paper from a hat, and put the indicated item on another player.
Players must wear the items until the game is over. The game ends when only one person is
left. Everyone else is a winner.
The game often breaks down into hilarity as people try to jump around loaded with burdensome gear. Hence the name, Burdensome Hopscotch.
Like any new design, shortcomings came to light as we playtested, and I made adjustments on the spot or between rounds:
• The targets were too difficult to hit, so I increased their size.
• When you did hit a target, getting to take your turn and put a burdensome item on
another player was too much of an advantage. A more balanced mechanic was to end
your turn, but let you put a crazy item on an opponent, which was reward enough.
• Originally, the winner was the first person to finish, but then you missed out on
watching some of the most burdened players duke it out (the best part!).
Any worthwhile playtest will lead to some opportunities for re-design. During playtests,
watch players for signs of frustration or boredom. If someone says, “This is fun,” and you
didn’t already know that just by watching, then something is off. Your game isn’t as fun as
it needs to be. Get a dialog going to figure it out. Reflect on your mechanics and/or balance.
It can also be extremely helpful to run a test where players vocalize their thought processes
as they’re playing.

Hopscotch Graduate
One of the most important takeaways for me was that much of designing a good game
comes from establishing a solid thought process for brainstorming and reflecting on features. What follows is an exploration into my experience designing a card game called The
Greatest Gift, which delves further into this process.
Defining Goals
A great starting point is to define goals so you don’t lose sight of what’s important to you.
For The Greatest Gift, they were:
• Keep everyone as happy as possible at all times.
• Keep everyone as involved as possible at all times.
• The game should be socially meaningful.
• Include humor or opportunities for humor.
• The game should have lasting replay value.
• The game should be very fun.
Let’s look at each of these goals individually and why I chose them.
Keep everyone as happy as possible at all times.
Many games have a tendency to punish players. Go to jail! Lose a turn! Pay each player 3
resources! Lose the game and sit sulking in the corner while you watch everyone else have fun for the
next half hour! Those may be fun mechanics for everyone else, but they are lousy for at least
one player. They’re often used to insert randomness into the game to even out chances for
those less skilled, but that can be accomplished with positive events instead. Rather than
lose a turn, try gain a turn. Instead of pay each player, try collect from each player. The happier
everyone is, the less likely they’ll never want to play again.
Keep everyone as involved as possible at all times.
I can’t tell you how many times I sit down to “play” a game with four or five people, only
to spend 80% of the time waiting for my turn. Maybe that’s okay for a cerebral game where
you need 10 minutes of super-cranial brainpower to compute the optimal next move, but
how many of those players will finish the game and say it was an incredible experience?
(Hint: often just two – the ones duking it out at the end.) The less downtime players have, the
less time they have to think about what else they’d rather be doing. If players are getting up
to go to the bathroom or get drinks (and they’re not jogging), or if they’re futzing with their
phone, there’s too much down time. (If you want to make a game with downtime, consider
making a fully asynchronous game.)
The game should be socially meaningful.
If you can craft a game that affects people’s lives through their interactions, then it creates an emotional bond. Here’s an example: you’re playing Mafia (also known as Werewolf) and people are dying left and right; it’s not until too late that you realize Jen – who’s
quiet and unassuming in everyday life – is Mafia, and she’s been telling bold-faced lies
and ruthlessly killing the entire time. A great, memorable moment like this forges such
a bond, which can be a powerful force in word-of-mouth promotion, and will instill a desire to play again or make a purchase. Some questions to ask yourself about your design:

115

116

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

Will people learn things they didn’t know about each other? Will they form connections they didn’t
have before? Can they learn to work together? Can they experience something memorable while playing?
Include humor or opportunities for humor.
I personally have the most fun in games where I realize I’m laughing a lot. Whether it’s
from scenarios created in the game, the content, or conversations, the more laughter, the better.
The game should have lasting replay value.
The more replayable a game is, the greater value it has to its players. And because it’s
being played more often, there are more chances for players to decide they’d like to go and
pick up their own copy. On the minimal level, a game will remain fun and interesting over
a long period of time (e.g. – Apples to Apples). On the higher level, a player’s perception of the
game and its strategies will actually evolve in such a way that it may even feel like a different
game (e.g. – Chess).
The game should be very fun.
Well, at least it’s easy to declare. If only it were as easy to deliver on. Entire books have
been written about what ‘fun’ is.29 It isn’t a single rule or play style or theme… it’s all aspects
of a game combined in an elegant way. You can’t just sit down, decide to make something
fun, and do it. So what is one to do? From playing loads of games and reflecting on fun experiences, you have both a wealth of examples of things that are fun and an arsenal of ideas
you want to try. You can break these down, build upon them, use them as inspiration – and
with imagination – mold them into something unique that fits together.
Starting with a Mechanic
There are plenty of ways to begin. One approach is to brainstorm game mechanics, hoping to find one that you really like. Some games are built entirely around a single mechanic
that works very well, and it’s a great approach to developing a game.
Hungry Hungry Hippos – the key mechanic is eat marbles. Simple. Nailed it. Kids love it.
Pictionary – the key mechanic is your partner has to guess what you’re quickly drawing. Another
simple concept constructed into a wildly successful game. Trivial Pursuit – the mechanic:
guess the answers to insignificant questions. The pies and the board could have been designed a
hundred different functional ways, and it would barely matter because the central mechanic
of answering trivia questions is such a strong focus. Magic: The Gathering – the mechanic:
construct a deck from spells you find, by chance, in booster packs, then face off with other players. The
game has many details, but the overarching mechanic has rendered it one of the most successful games of all time.
The game market is saturated with mechanics, and it’s only getting more saturated over
time. Games aren’t un-inventing themselves. Because of this, many are merely old mechanics mixed in a new way or with a new theme slapped on them. Such games can certainly be
fun and successful, but will have a harder time of it. So if you can come up with a mechanic
that is both fun and novel, you should strongly consider developing it. That is one of the surest ways to create a unique game that has a chance of standing out amongst the crowd. It’s
one of the holy grails of game design.

Starting with Theme
Another point to start from is to brainstorm themes. Lost in the desert. The revolutionary
war. Space travel. Prom night. Cliff jumping. Baking. Quitting work. Antarctic excavation of lost
civilizations. Bedwetting. Espionage and explosives. Et cetera, et cetera.
Then choose one that appeals enough. Say you picked Antarctic excavation of lost civilizations. Now it’s time to go nuts and brainstorm a list of possible mechanics and other game
elements. You’ll find they come a lot easier in the context of a theme:
• “Chunks” of ice on the board that stack. Chunks start randomly distributed around
the board with various depths. Turns might consist of getting to move (dig) a random
number of chunks to an adjacent square to find pieces of alien technology underneath.
Stacks can be pushed and collapse on players.
• Can fall through thin ice.
• Can we have a frosty board surface and technology items scattered underneath, so
lights can be activated by your character to illuminate under the ice a bit?
• Cooperative game? A way players can help each other when spread out? Goal: find
the weak spots in the ice shelf and all activate explosives at once to unearth the technology before it destroys Earth?
• Possibly have characters connect circuits that light up areas between them.
• Find breaks in the surface (“dive spots”) and can dive under the board. Shortcuts to
other dive spots on the board. Maybe the board is raised so your character can actually go under it, and stick to it with magnets.
And so on, for a few pages or more. You’ll know you have enough when you’re feeling a
mixture of satisfaction, excitement, and exhaustion.
Starting with Play Style
A third way to begin (and the last I’ll discuss, though there are more) is with appealing
play styles and game elements. This was my starting point for The Greatest Gift.
I had been inspired by Apples to Apples because it keeps everyone engaged at all moments,
involves an element of self-expression, and has no punishing mechanics. Based on my goals
and this inspiration, I made some structural decisions to start the game off:
• It will be a card game. At the time, I had just made a boardgame, and wanted to try
something different. The elegance and expandability of card-centric games were alluring.
• Every player will make a “play” of some sort each turn. I believe in the power of this so
strongly that I will attempt to include it in any tabletop game I ever design. It can
practically eliminate downtime.
• The outcome of a round will be determined by the opinion of the player whose turn it is. I admired this aspect of Apples to Apples because it makes people’s personalities an aspect
of gameplay, and makes the game vastly diverse with different players.
Now, you may be thinking, Wait a minute! That’s a lot of “inspiration” to take from another
game. True. But that’s fine. So many masterpieces in this world are inspired by other great
creations. Don’t hesitate to build off portions of other designs that work! But when you do,
make sure to find what it is that makes your game unique and fun and gives it its own voice.
Look for that holy grail.

The Drawing Board: Going Back to It.
I had a few false starts when I moved on to brainstorming mechanics. I’d even gotten on
to the point of playtesting a battle-themed version, and it failed miserably. It happens – make
sure to recognize it. I returned to the drawing board with my goals and three ground rules,
and decided to brainstorm themes to see where that might get me.
Now, I didn’t just sit down and start listing things. I gave myself direction with a single
question: I need to come up with a theme… Well, what kinds of things do people like? This is notable for two reasons.
1. It became the concept of my game, though I didn’t know it yet, and
2. it demonstrates a very powerful design technique that I use relentlessly: asking yourself
questions.
The Power of Asking Questions
Any time you find yourself stuck on a game design problem or needing fresh ideas, start
asking yourself related questions. Try and answer them. That may require asking further
and deeper, more specific questions that demand their own answers. The more questions
you can raise, the more you will end up exploring the problem space and the more likely
you’ll find something you’re happy with.
Doing this will feel like a recursive conversation with yourself. Humans inherently think
this way30, but you can harness its strength by making it an explicit exercise.
Here’s an example from a fictional board game where the designer finds the pawns tedious:
• Pawns not working (Why not?)
• Not satisfying to move the pawn around (How so?)
• Too little choice
• Resulting movement doesn’t matter much in the short-term
• Turns are long because of the pawn movement (How can I fix it?)
• Can we make pawns faster?
• Possibly remove pawns altogether? (What could satisfy their purpose instead?)
• Need a way to determine a player’s allowed play during a turn that
has both an element of randomness and choice. (What are the possibilities?)
• Use a die roll plus the castle types player has to determine allowed plays (rather than the space the pawn lands on).
• Or players build up a set of cards as a personal toolkit of possible plays, and draw one from here each turn?
Quite often my thinking, brainstorming, and questioning all ends up in tiered, bulletedlist form. This is exactly what I did when brainstorming themes for The Greatest Gift: What
sort of theme do I want? Well, what kinds of things do people like? Let’s see… Wealth. Fame. Romance. Being smart or skilled. Superpowers.

Game Analyses

My list of potential themes looked something like this:
• Wealth
• Diamonds
• Pirate’s Booty
• Winning the lotto
• Owning an Island
• No debt
• (etc…)
• Fame
• Rock Star
• Famous Athlete
• Part of the Mob
• On TV
• (etc…)
• Romance
• Smarts/Skills
• Superpowers
• (etc…)
Once I had a large list, I looked it over trying to decide if any of the themes would lend
themselves to a game with fun mechanics and ample humor. Then, I had an epiphany that I
attribute to the exercise of listing out ideas exhaustively – All these themes are fun… why don’t
I make a game about all of them? And thus, The Greatest Gift was born. Each potential theme
became a card in the game.
The Greatest Gift
I went through eight iterations of various rule sets and mechanics. Here’s the basic idea
for the final version:
• There are hundreds of cards, each with a unique skill, item, or other desirable thing
pictured and described on it.
• Each player gets a hand of 7 cards which they refill each round.
• Each round, it’s one player’s turn to receive gifts. The other players pick something
from their hands they think this person would like most in real life, and put it facedown in a pile.
• The gift receiver flips over these gifts and decides which one he or she likes best, and
keeps it in a personal collection of loot on the table (these are points).
• The player that gave the best gift gets rewarded from a central collection of stuff for
their own loot collection, thus also scoring a point for a gift-well-given.
Based on mechanics, playtests, and feedback, let’s look at how it stacked up against my
original goals.

119

120

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

Keep everyone as happy as possible at all times.
The game has no punishing mechanics and the theme is about kindness, life aspirations,
and getting wonderful things. In practice, players never appear upset or frustrated.
Keep everyone as involved as possible at all times.
This goal is satisfied by the play style of having everyone make a move and provide input
on every turn, and turns being quick.
Try to make the game socially meaningful.
As predicted, basing the outcome of each turn on a player’s opinion means you learn
about that player. As players choose gifts, you’re learning what they want and value in life,
and you’re also finding out what other players think you want and value in life – times when
these don’t align are often the most exciting. (One of the most memorable turns for me was
when a girl named Natalie was playing, and narrowed her gift choice down to Own your own
Island and a pair of Roller Skates. Natalie chose roller skates, and meant it; an impassioned
explosion of conversation ensued.)
In an effort to cater to this goal, I developed cards that would create morally difficult
choices when compared to cards grounded in materialism. These include Cure Cancer, End
World Hunger, and Save a Life. One card, Avoid Apocalypse, describes a scenario where the
world will be obliterated in 263 years – long after you’re dead – but you have the power to
stop it. So do you choose that, or one of the other gifts that someone has offered you, like being Fluent in All Languages? For some players, these are difficult decisions, and everyone can
go home with new insight into the personalities of their friends and family.
Include humor or opportunities for humor.
I included a small number of cards that catered to both silly and sarcastic players (too
much and the game starts losing social significance because it can’t be taken seriously) and
I took care to make the text entertaining when possible. For example, gifts like Tofu or A
Girlfriend let players rag on each other, while some class-clown types are drawn to presents
like Really Big Hands because they can rationalize what would be awesome about having
hands the size of large frying pans.
The game should have lasting replay value.
I believe this is the game’s weakness. The Greatest Gift does well in that it feels fresh each
time you play it with a new grouping of people, and that each combination of gifts feels different than the last. But once everybody knows the cards, the game loses some of its novelty.
If I were convinced the game needed it, a fix would be to add a mechanic that randomly
changes a player’s mind set each game. For example, this could be accomplished by having
each player draw a “personality card” which would affect their decisions. Bob could draw
Evil CEO of a Mega Corporation, and for that game, Bob would choose his gifts as if he imagined himself to have turned into that character – which is interesting because different players would take on those characters uniquely. Another way to increase shelf-life is to release
expansions, which is appealing because the game is so easily extendable.
The game should be very fun.
I’ll let anyone who plays make up their own mind about this!

Game Analyses

Promise Cards
One interested publisher tried the game, and sent it back with a note saying, We like it,
though it needs something else, but we’re not sure what.
Deep down, I agreed. I realized I wanted The Greatest Gift to be more surprising, and for
it to more strongly affect people’s lives. That’s asking a lot, but I began to think about games
I consider very memorable and surprising.
Two that came to mind were Truth or Dare and Spin the Bottle. What fascinating games!
Merely by making something a “rule” of the game, human beings will take actions that are
normally far outside their realm of comfort. Now I have to kiss Evelyn? Okay, if that’s the rule…
Or, What? You’re daring me to eat this crate of jalapeños and then call my boss and quit? Well… okay,
but only because it’s my turn. I wouldn’t normally do this!
These games contain powerful moments that people remember their whole lives. That’s
the essence I wanted to design into The Greatest Gift. So I asked the drastic question, How
could I make players kiss? And how can I do it such that it fits with the game rather than overpowering it?
It felt natural as a gift, like any other card. A Kiss – except this gift was different because
if you offered it to someone and they chose it, they got a real kiss from you rather than an
imaginary thing. And it was surprising, because the person choosing amongst the gifts
could only speculate who had offered it! It was a totally new type of gift, dubbed a Promise
Card. This felt like the missing element, so I added more: A Hug, A Dollar, A Free Meal, A
Massage, A Date, Servant for a Day, Snacks, and so on.
In testing, promise cards proved to be a success and created some potent moments. They
were a hit even when they weren’t picked above other offerings. Merely their presence in the
set of gifts upped the stakes and caused more chatter and excitement than usual.
Know Your Audience
Some playtesters wanted more strategy, and I tried a few versions with additional cards
that would change rules, augment a player’s abilities, or thwart others (counter to one of my
goals, it’s worth noting; a moment of weakness on my part). In all cases, the changes only
made gameplay more choppy, complicated the rules, and diluted the essence of The Greatest
Gift.
It took me a while to realize a game doesn’t have to satisfy everyone, it just has to be an
amazing game to the audience you’re targeting. Know your audience. I couldn’t please the
entire Settlers of Catan contingent because they look for distinctly different characteristics
from the games they play.
Once I was able to step back and realize this, I became as satisfied with The Greatest Gift
as I expected I could get. The audience I was after was the casual mass market audience of
families, friends, and party gamers looking for a short and social experience; as long as they
enjoyed the game, then it was what it needed to be, and the rest would be icing. (Though the
best designers are never truly satisfied; it’s what pushes them to constantly evolve new and
better concepts.)
The World of Publication
Now, it’s one thing to design a game you’re satisfied with, and it’s an entirely different
world to try to publish it. There are different approaches, and the first question you have to
ask yourself is, Do I want to self-publish, or try to license to a publisher? One informing factor
should be how much time you are willing to spend working for your game. Self-publication
can become a full-time job. It also has higher monetary risks, but higher rewards, too.

121

122

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

For deep insight into how publishing works and deciding which path to take, I highly
recommend reading The Game Inventor’s Guidebook,31 written by a selection of industry leaders. It proved vastly informative for me, and helped me decide that I didn’t have the time nor
the money to self-publish.
Publishing and My Next Six Years
I can quickly sum up the six years following my decision to find a publisher. I found an
agent that wanted to represent me, and had plenty of industry contacts. My agent found an
interested publisher and we sent off a prototype for the publisher to work from. What a wonderful feeling! Then, years of waiting – with large publishers, you cannot count on anything.
Sometimes they are black holes where games go to die. Other times, the publisher can have
a game out in multiple continents within the year and promote it like it’s the best thing to
happen to gaming since dice.
My publisher tweaked gameplay, added hundreds more cards, and named it The Perfect
Present (I’ve been referring to it in this piece as The Greatest Gift… if you read on, you’ll see
why). In 2007 it finally showed up on the Amazon and Barnes and Noble websites, though I
was waiting for the day when I could stroll down an aisle and see it on store shelves. More
waiting and delays. Then scads of toys manufactured in China went through recalls, and
the publisher developed major financial issues and needed to make cutbacks. Somewhere in
there, I was told, they shut down their games division.
This is why I say I “kind of” published it. There are ten thousand copies floating around
out there, but there aren’t likely to be more until the game finds a new publisher.
Today
This leaves me back where I sat before finding my agent and publisher. I can’t use any
of the changes the publisher made to the game after receiving it because I don’t have the
intellectual rights. Luckily, I was only attached to the name they came up with – The Perfect
Present – and not much else. I’ve already renamed it to The Greatest Gift.
On the brighter side, I’m a free agent now. I have not begun to send The Greatest Gift
around to publishers again, but when I do, the process will be easier with the advent of printon-demand gaming resources. One such website is called The Game Crafter (thegamecrafter.
com). It makes prototyping easy by providing plenty of options for game pieces, and I’ve
found the cost in printing to be less expensive than going to a printing service. There are
currently tradeoffs in print quality, but I’m pleased with the ease and convenience. (The
Greatest Gift is available there if you want to check it out.)
Some Advice about Agents and Publishers
It was wildly exciting to go through the process of finding an agent and licensing The
Greatest Gift to a publisher. It felt like a honeymoon phase. In retrospect, I can say in actuality I made some poor decisions with respect to both parties, partly due to my naiveté and
general lack of communication.
I’d like to share some lessons with you so hopefully you won’t get tripped up in the same
way I did.
Namely, if you do find an agent, make sure you know how much they are willing to support you and what level of input and communication you’ll have with potential publishers.
See if you can be included in the development process to give feedback a couple times along
the way, since you, the designer, will have valuable insight. Where my relationship broke

Game Analyses

down with my agent was that they only served to insulate the publisher from me, when they
should have been supporting me and the game. I should have raised this as something that
was important to me when settling on terms for representation.
Later, when I finally had the published version of the game in hand, I noticed problems
that could have been avoided had there been any communication allowed. Here were the
worst offenders:
• The text was too small. Older players would not be able to read it. (You must always
consider readability! Use legible fonts and sizes.)
• The category name was too prominent at the top of the card, which some players
thought was the name of the gift (the real gift name ran along the left side of the card).
This was a problem that I’d found in playtests and fixed before sending to the publisher. The
best arrangement had the name of the gift both along the left side and at the top of the
card, with the category occupying a smaller space in the corner relative to its lesser
significance.
• The Promise card category had disappeared, and those gifts were mixed into another
category such that their function was obscured and lost.
So make sure you know what your Agent-Publisher-Designer relationship will be before
signing any contracts. And you don’t necessarily need an agent. Many smaller publishers
have instructions on their websites for submitting games directly.
In the case where you do get a publisher but they aren’t willing to work with you directly,
the hardest thing about getting your game published is letting go of control. You’d expect
it would be one of the happiest days of your life when you receive a freshly-boxed copy of
your very own game. Opening the packaging and looking at the pieces and setting it up
should be a momentous occasion. Hopefully it will be! But it’s no guarantee. For me, it was
the opposite. It’s extremely difficult to see what someone has done to your idea. A creative
director once told me: “One of the hardest things about becoming a creative director is having to watch people less talented than you implement designs that you could do better.”
Sometimes you just have to let go.
Now What? Tips!
Okay, you’ve heard my story. Now, I have a few final tips to pass on before I release you
back into the wild of game design.
Keep a Game Journal
This is relevant no matter your choice of creative medium: experience as much diversity
in it as possible, and keep a journal with your salient thoughts about those experiences. For
games, this translates to: play as many different games as possible, and write your thoughts
on them!
I make sure I have my journal with me when I play a new game, because I know I won’t
remember half my revelations and feelings afterwards. I have to jot notes as I’m playing.
I write anywhere from 2-15 bullet points per game (total), even if I play often. The sorts
of things to write down are…
• Moments that surprised you, and why.
• Mechanics that work well. Maybe you can build on them.

123

124

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

• Ideas for ways to improve an aspect of the game. Any time you don’t like something,
don’t just complain about it, ask yourself how you’d improve it! If you ever make a
similar game, wouldn’t it be great to already have notes on how to do better?
• Amazing game moments. Did something make everyone laugh? Argue light-heartedly? Gasp in surprise? Write it down. These are moments to strive for in your own
games, and dissecting them can help you understand how to potentially work them
into your designs.
Here are some examples:
• Cosmic Encounter – The alien power card you choose at the start of the game gives
you unique powers and makes it different each time you play. Wonderful mechanic;
always feel like you have something special nobody else does.
• Magic, The Gathering – Buying and opening a pack is like gambling. (Will I get good
cards? Will I get that rare I need? If I buy enough I’m sure to get it…) No wonder this game
is so addictive.
• Magic, The Gathering – The number of possibilities when creating combos with cards is
staggering. And almost all cards feel useful in certain occasions and against specific
decks. I could sit here and build a deck forever.
• Shadows over Camelot – Still can’t decide whether the grail quest is worthwhile without
Arthur, since it’s difficult to get enough grail cards in there in time and it wastes turns
to go and come back. (Later I made a firm conclusion, but it’s a sign of good game balance that I wasn’t sure if our time was better spent on this quest or others. It prodded
us to try various strategies.)
Why keep a journal? Two reasons. First, you’ll find that you’re thinking more critically
about the game as you play it, and you’ll make observations your conscious mind may otherwise miss. It will help you think more insightfully about your own games as well.
Second, it’s brain fuel. When you need a boost in creativity, flip to a random page in your
journal and start reading. Since you’re poring over all the most interesting moments and
salient aspects from all the games you’ve played, it jumpstarts your brain to thinking about
what truly makes a game good or bad, and the variety of your notes will help energize your
creativity.
A Resource – Stock Photography
Now, a tip about a great prototyping resource. When I designed The Greatest Gift, it had
roughly 200 cards, each different. I love art, and I knew that if each card had unique imagery, it would not only make them more interesting to look at, but would often enhance the
meaning of the card. Images can be suggestive, they can be humorous, and they can also set
a mood for your game.
There was no way I could afford to pay an artist to produce the needed imagery – that
would cost tens of thousands of dollars. The solution lied in stock photography. I used a
website (istockphoto.com) that had a huge database of photography (and some art) and only
cost a couple dollars per download.
Ask Drastic Questions
Here’s a tip for when you’re thinking about your game on a high level or realize there’s a
problem around a central aspect of your game: Sometimes it helps to not only ask yourself
questions around your design, but also to ask drastic questions – questions that address the
very nature of your design and could cause you to rethink it, even in its entirety.

For example: Would a different kind of die better suit my game? Do I need a game board? What
would happen if the players didn’t have pawns? Often, the answers to these questions are what
you’d expect – of course my players need pawns! But, on occasion, they lead to an epiphany.
Here’s a list of questions to ask yourself about your game designs. There are a multitude
for you to come up with on your own, but this should get you started:
• What would happen if I removed mechanic x from the game? Was it necessary?
What would I replace it with?
• How can I make people laugh? Cry? Get excited? Be eager for their turn?
• How can I make players think about the game a day or a week after playing?
• Is there anything in my design that has never been seen in a game before? How would
I add that?
• What if this were cooperative and not competitive?
• What aspect of this game will make someone excited to buy it when they’re reading
the back of the box? (What’s the hook?)
• How can I get players to learn about each other?
• How will this game be fun while playing the 100th time?
• What if gameplay had to be half as long as it is now? What would that look like?
• What if there couldn’t be any dice? Pawns? Board? Cards?
If you want a ton of great questions to ask about your game to get your creativity flowing, check out Jesse Schell’s The Art of Game Design: A Deck of Lenses32 – a deck of cards full
of such questions.
What’s Next? You.
Now it’s time for you. There’s a reason you’re reading this book: you have a deep desire
to do great things in the world of gaming. You can, and you will. All you need to do is get
out there and make a game, or finish up and polish the one you’re working on. Coalesce
those ideas that have been swimming around in your head. Whether you make it for yourself, your family, your friends, or for the world, a game is more than just a piece of entertainment. Games may only appear to be a few plastic pieces and a board, but they’re much more
than that. With your ingenuity, those items can become an elegant unification of mechanics
and theme that can help us learn about each other and really spend our time together in a
meaningful way.
Define evocative goals, then stick to them, and let them guide you. Find a starting point
that works for you – from theme, mechanic, play style, or another angle. Brainstorm the hell
out of all aspects of your design. Ask yourself questions to explore your work, and build on
your observations from other great games. Make sure your game finds its own unique voice.
And establish a thorough thought process and use it each step of the way. If you do these
things, great designs will be within your reach.
So go out there, and make this world a more fun, interesting, and connected place. Help
us get to know ourselves, our families, and each other.
It’s important.

I LOVE PANDEMIC (AND I DESPAIR FOR SERIOUS GAMES)
by John Sharp

I.

I really like Matt Leacock’s Pandemic, a boardgame in which players work together to
protect humanity from four world-devouring viruses. The game ranks up there with Settlers of Catan as a sure-fire “gateway drug” to German-style boardgames; it is thoughtfully
designed, deeply polished, and has just the right amount of story world. Most everything
about the game suits my idea of ‘fun’: strategic thinking, a healthy dose of variability from
play session to play session, emergent complexity, cooperative play and thoughtful communication design.
Rather than rambling on about how much I like the game, I would like to use it as a lens
for thinking about serious games.33 There is an increasing gold rush to serious games — the
Apps for Healthy Kids initiative, an ever-growing number of conferences and festivals, the
incredible amounts of foundation and grant money supporting their creation and study, and
on and on. We are looking to games to solve societal problems, to free people from ignorance,
to proverbially solve world hunger. But more often, we are doing a disservice to ourselves,
to the causes we embrace and to games alike. We need to stop and reflect on whether or not
games are really the best solution to the issues we fight for, and if they are, we need to do the
real work to make the right games.
During his first Pandemic play session, Eric Zimmerman said something along the lines
of “Pandemic is my new favorite serious game.” His comment made a great deal of sense to
me— the game embodies many of the best qualities of serious games. It gives an abstracted
overview of the process by which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention address
epidemics. It encourages important collaboration and active listening skills. It provides a

129

meaningful context for thinking about probability. The space of possibility of the game requires the development of strategies, learning the lessons of focusing on short-term issues
at risk of allowing long-term problems to fester. These are all qualities that most any serious
game designer would love to embed in their creations. Sadly, few manage to get anywhere
close to this level of success.
I would like to use Pandemic as a vehicle for considering the four flawed assumptions
made about serious games that alternately irk and depress me— first, that games are a form
of media; second, that games can deliver messages; third, that games are simulations; and
fourth, that videogames are the most suitable form of games for serious games to take.
II.

Pandemic is a boardgame in which two to four34 players cooperatively work to eradicate
a group of four viruses spreading around the world before any one virus hits a tipping
point or before there are eight virus outbreaks. The map comprises cities connected by travel
routes overlaid with a ball and stick graph around which the players travel. Players move
though four zones, each with their own color-coded virus — the blue of North America and
Europe; the yellow of Central America and South America; the black of India, the Middle
East, Eastern Europe and Russia; and the red of Asia.
Player cards and Infection cards are the two card types in the game. Player cards are
composed of three distinct card types— City cards that are used to cure the four viruses and
facilitate movement on the board; Epidemic cards that cause the infection engine of the game
to speed up; and Special Event cards that grant players one-time actions that facilitate their
quest to cure the four diseases.
The Infection cards function as the “engine” that spreads disease around the board. The
Infection cards begin their work before the game even starts; the cities represented by the
first three cards atop the shuffled Infection deck are assigned three virus cubes each, the cities on the next three cards are assigned two virus cubes each, and the next three are assigned
one virus cube each. The nine used Infection cards are then placed in the Infection discard
pile where they await the first epidemic.
The game begins with all player tokens on Atlanta, the home of the CDC. On their turn,
each player can do four actions selected from a list of eight— move from their current city to
an adjacent city; clear a virus unit from the city they occupy; expend a Player card to take a
direct flight to the city represented on that card; build a Research Station on a location they
occupy and for which they hold the corresponding Player card; move from one Research
Station to another; cure a virus by playing five city cards of that virus’ color while in a city
of that color; and finally, give a Player card to another player when both players are on the
same city and the active player holds that city’s Player card.
Each player takes on a randomly selected role from a set of five— Dispatcher, Medic,
Operations Expert, Researcher and Scientist. Each role provides a unique “special skill” for
dealing with the containment and eradication of the viruses. For example, the Medic role can
clear all virus units on a city at the cost of one action, and the Researcher can cure a virus
with only four city cards (all other players must have five) of the corresponding color. In order to have a chance at winning, the players must cooperatively apply the unique strengths
of their roles in order to maximize their ability to successfully eradicate all four viruses.
Once a player has completed her four actions for a turn, she does two things: draws two
Player cards from the top of the Player card deck to add to her hand (and immediately discards as many cards as it takes to get down to a hand of seven), and then draws two, three
or four Infection cards35 from the Infection deck to indicate which cities get an additional
virus cube.

Game Analyses

Any given city can hold no more than three virus units of any type. If, through the draw
of an Epidemic card or through actions triggered by the Infection Cards, a city is assigned
more than three virus units of one type, an Outbreak occurs. All adjacent cities gain an additional unit of that virus type. If any of these already have three of that virus unit color, then
they too have an Outbreak.
Drawing from the Player deck is always fraught with anxiety, as interlaced with the City
and Special Event cards are Epidemic cards. The Epidemic cards cause viruses to spread on
the player’s current location, and tightens the loop on the occurrence of new virus cubes
popping up on the already-infected cities by virtue of the shuffling of the already-played
Infection cards in the discard pile.
The game is won when the players can cure all four viruses. The game ends when eight
of these outbreaks have occurred. The game is lost when the entire deck of Player cards is
used, when all of one color of virus cube are placed on the board, or when eight Outbreaks
have occurred.
III.

Since the industrial revolution and the commodity culture it brought to bear, games have
increasingly been treated as media products like books, movies and songs. The business
models and patterns of consumption relating to books, magazines, movies and music are all
based on a short cycle of release, consume and move on. It is into this model of consumer
culture that videogames have positioned themselves, and in the process became a form of
ephemera– quickly consumed with little or no expectation of lasting effect. But games are
ever-changing, culturally-shaped practices that have more in common with square dancing, and, as Frank Lantz has pointed out, butterfly collecting36 than they do with passivelyconsumed entertainment products. And so the more we try to treat games like media, the
less game-like they are.
This is a real issue for serious games — if we approach them like leisure products with
the associated ‘empty calorie’ expectations, we are destined to fail. For the systemic exploration of a phenomenon to really sink in, we need our players to spend more time with our
games. Most serious games are positioned in such an overtly didactic manner derived from
linear media without a real consideration of the necessary design considerations of games as
practices. This leads to the treatment of serious games as pamphlets or documentary films
that serve up a productized point of view.
Yes, Pandemic is a product— a shrink-wrapped German-style boardgame— no getting
around that. But like most German-style boardgames, it is designed as a serially revisited
play space primed for replay. Purchasing Pandemic is more like buying a social practice than
buying a sugary snack or taking a bitter pill that is eaten and quickly forgotten. Pandemic is
the kind of game that provides a space for spending time with people, and a structure for
players to get to know one another. The very rules of the game require players to engage with
one another socially and intellectually in order to come up with the best possible approach
to contain the four viruses before they destroy the world. Players learn from one another,
give one another advice and work as a team to contain the viruses on the board, collect the
cards necessary to cure the viruses and generally make the most of their roles and turns.37
A rhythm quickly emerges as players struggle against the four viruses, in large part due
to the cooperative nature of the game. The player roles provide just enough distinction to
give everyone a feeling of importance. At the same time, everyone is swept up in the cause
— working together, suggesting strategies for using one another’s capabilities, collectively
thinking through each player’s options, sometimes even planning a round or more ahead for
all players.38

Pandemic is a game, through and through. It is not another consumer media product— it
is a game that encourages repeated play sessions that are all very similar and yet made distinct by the ways play unfold around and through the mechanics and rules. For me, this is
what a game is— a space to return to again and again to test myself, to engage with others, to
have opportunity to do things that daily life does not permit. The average serious game lacks
this depth, in large part due to the emphasis on content, and the product-oriented conception
of games as medium and not a practice.

In his critique of Bioshock, Clint Hocking stated, “Bioshock seems to suffer from a powerful dissonance between what it is about as a game, and what it is about as a story.”39 He
coined the phrase ludonarrative dissonance to describe this— what happens when the narrative mapped onto a game does not work in concert with the game’s mechanics and goals.
Hocking goes on to discuss the two ‘contracts’ a game makes with its player: the ludic contract, and the narrative contract. At first glance, these seem compatible with one another
— game-wise, Bioshock is a first person shooter in which you are given the opportunity to
engage with a Randian Objectivist exploration of the limits of self-interest threaded through
with a narrative that explores a dystopian vision of a Randian Objectivist world gone rancid.
The player’s role in the gameworld as enacted through the mechanics and goals, however,
contradicts the Objectivist agenda of the narrative— the player is asked to help out Atlas,
a character who rails against the Randian vision. This creates a dissonant, confusing play
experience, as players looking for the optimal way to ‘beat’ the game will bump into the tension between the games mechanics, goals, theme and narrative.
Pandemic does a good job of pairing the relationship between the gameplay (using an
action economy centered on movement, virus removal and card collection in order to cure
the four viruses while working against the game’s Infection engine) and the theme of the
game (a team of CDC professionals combat four simultaneous pandemics). The Infection
engine drives the experience, with players carefully watching the spread of virus cubes via
the Infection deck, players cringing with each draw of an Epidemic card, and the players’
strategizing to contain and eradicate the four diseases.
Within the flow of the game, a narrative unfolds, but not one that follows any strict predetermined, nuanced arc. Still, the bewildering array of possible play experiences all lead
to one of two possible conclusions to the story arc — either the viruses overtake the world,
or the players successfully cure the four viruses. Getting from the starting point with nine
infected cities to one of these outcomes happens in very different ways from play session
to play session. It is in this space of possibility that a rich player-driven experience unfolds.
Serious games have their own version of ludonarrative dissonance — what I will call
ludopedagogical dissonance. There is often a disconnect between the theme of a serious
game and the actual play experience and the assumed knowledge and experience it transfers
to the player. Perhaps through a lack of understanding of games and their strengths, many
people create games that attempt to use the form as yet another medium through which a
point of view is disseminated. Games are not a secret language through which we can communicate with youth to make them understand the important things we have to tell them.
Nor are they the newest multimedia spin on the old chocolate-coated cod liver oil trick that
makes something ‘good for you’ seem ‘fun for you.’ The fact is games are not going to be
good at explaining a single position or a set of facts in the same way a documentary film or
a pamphlet or a poster might.

Paraphrasing James Paul Gee, games are excellent tools for preparing for future learning.
I interpret this to mean that games can and do educate, but not in the ways traditional media
