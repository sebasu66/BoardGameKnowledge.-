... fine art cannot itself devise the rule by which it is to bring about its product. Since,
however, a product can never be called art unless it is preceded by a rule, it must be
nature in the subject (and through the attunement of his powers) that gives the rule to
art; in other words, fine art is possible only as the product of genius.56
This artist-genius “deriv[es] the rule from the particular” a form of aesthetic judgment
called the “reflective” mode.57 Fine art is thus the production of rules outside those of nature,
a practice to which game designers can surely relate. Kant’s genius figure is characterized by
originality, the ability to create “exemplary” rather than derivative works.
If all of this highfalutin philosophical jargon sounds strangely familiar, this is because
it’s an early form of the “auteur theory” that informs most naïve contemporary notions of
art. Brathwaite embraces this early modern conception of the artist unironically when she
admits that much of her design process occurs within what her friends call the “black box”
of her mind.58 Kant himself wrote of this black box as a sine qua non characteristic of the genius, who “does not know how he came by the ideas for [the work]; nor is it in his power to
devise such products at his pleasure, or by following a plan.”59 Brathwaite’s possible status
as a genius aside, in what ways does Train itself crystallize Kant’s notions of originality and
exemplary status?
There is only one physical copy of Train, while even the oldest folk boardgames, Senet
and the Royal Game of Ur, were reproduced and played by all social classes. Even one-of-akind archeological finds like The Stanway Game were, in all likelihood, not always one-ofa-kind. Both as social practices and economic products, games seek wide audiences. Only

Game Analyses

in the history of fine art do we see one-copy games like Brathwaite’s, such as the prepared
gameboards of the Fluxus movement. Yoko Ono’s All White Chess Set (1966), for example, is a
modified game of Chess wherein all the black pieces of the board are switched out for a second white set.60 The game is theoretically playable, but its political message is just as easily
communicated through a short conceptual exercise.
Like White Chess, Train works on the level of concept art. In reply to a prospective player
who saw Train and openly stated that she didn’t want to play, Brathwaite replied: “you just
did.”61 Yet, unlike a concept piece, Train does not end with its concept. The game has been refined for playability. Although all but a few games of Train have ended with the revelation of
the first Terminus card, we’ve seen that it’s nevertheless possible to keep playing, or play the
game for score, or even set alternative goals for oneself. Train is thus distinct from the Fluxus
games in its simultaneous refinement of high concept and actual play, as good an argument
for its exemplary status as any.
But are these Enlightenment notions of art relevant today? Train’s existence as an individual, non-reproducible artifact opens it up to further scrutiny by the neo-Marxist political
philosophy of the Frankfurt School. In the 1930s, Walter Benjamin described the effects of
mass production on the status of art. Historically, so long as works of art remained singular
and were stored primarily in museums and estates, they retained an “aura,” or “unique
phenomenon of distance.”62 Reproduction diminishes that aura, troubles the notion of originality, and brings a piece of art closer to an idealized “public.” Train retains its aura after the
age of mechanical reproduction, during an even more turbulent time for the popular idea of
authenticity: the age of digital reproduction.
For Benjamin, this reduction in aura was a good thing: “for the first time in world history,
mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on
ritual.”63 That which retains an aura inspires fear and hatred in the masses but garners critical acclaim, while in a mechanically reproduced medium, such as film, critical and popular
receptions align. This holds true for Train: it is critically acclaimed and popularly reviled.
Games and ritual have a special relationship with one another: Train and its space of play
retain much of the secrecy and separateness that characterize folk games and religious rites
alike for Huizinga.64 Perhaps one way that artgames set themselves apart from the rest of the
medium is by playing with these notions of aura and ritual.
Of course, all the “The Mechanic is the Message” games share this aura. The reason Train
justifies additional concern is that it deals directly with the same political situation that the
Frankfurt School was reacting against. The cult of the Fuhrer in Nazy Germany had “aestheticized politics,” while Marxism hoped to politicize art.65 Benjamin reacted favorably to
the constructivist art and Soviet montage cinema of the early revolution, but after WWII the
political climate changed. From 1949 to 1956, the USSR enforced a state art doctrine known
as “socialist realism,” which denied the basic truths of life and labor in the Soviet system.
Instead it showed workers a vision of the future that was promised if they remained true to
the Party through its many stages of revolution.
Writing later in the Frankfurt tradition, Theodor Adorno’s aesthetic theory was an argument against this twisted form of politicized art. This school of art’s greatest offense, to
Adorno, was that its works contained false social content rather than formally reflecting the
social conditions of their creation:

153

154

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

Art becomes something social through its in-itself, and it becomes in-itself by means
of the social force of production effective in it. The dialectic of the social and of the
in-itself of the artwork is the dialectic of its own constitution to the extent that it
tolerates nothing interior that does not externalize itself, nothing external that is not
the bearer of the inward, the truth content.66
Train proves the sociopolitical value of procedural reality embodied by the “The Mechanic is the Message” series, a dialectic between a player’s actions and the cultural dimensions they take on through simulation—the “proceduralist style” is itself a working argument about the ludic medium’s form. Night and Fog’s long, slow tracks through Auschwitz
and Majdanek, required viewing in many middle schools throughout the United States, have
somehow distanced us over time from the horrors of the Holocaust.67 Films such as this
disconnect the results of the Final Solution from its causes. But people already know to be
in the lookout for openly homicidal impulses; Train, on the other hand, has the ability to
approximate the hidden, mental source of genocide. It examines the historical period not
by indirect reference or mummified audiovisuals but through direct ludic experience and
player interaction.
Finally we’re ready to tackle the contemporary situation of art that Train engages. Noel
Carroll characterizes much of the mid-20th century philosophy of art as “neo-Wittgensteinian.”68 That is, for a short time, philosophers gave up on trying to provide a definition or set
of necessary and sufficient conditions for art. Morris Weitz provided two convincing arguments against the definability of art, the “open concept” and “family resemblance.” The open
concept argument claims that art cannot be defined because new artworks are constantly
being created, and no definition could ever hope to predict what we might accept as art in the
future. The family resemblance argument holds that we cannot identify all the things called
“art” by common features; rather, we accept something as art through disconnected “strands
of similarities” relevant to each medium.69
Carroll exposes the critical flaw in these arguments when he asks, “What does that have
to do with the conditions requisite for the status of artwork?” (emphasis added).70 Perhaps
paradoxically, even if art is a dead concept, this doesn’t prevent us from identifying works
of art. According to Carroll, in a preliminary version of the argument in “The Artworld,”
Arthur Danto held that at least one necessary condition for the artwork is that it be “enfranchised by art theories.”71 Train thus comes at a privileged time, having the chance to help
forge the very theories of game art that will allow us to categorize and critique the artgames
of the future. None of these theories need break radically with the continuum of art history,
so long as they remain mindful of the medium’s defining qualities: procedural rhetoric, configurative play, the donning of roles, and the creation or demarcation of a space.
At the Art History of Games symposium, Brian Schrank and Jay Bolter presented a model
for the avant-garde in games, distinguishing between the formal and the political avant-garde
in art history.72 The formal avant-garde questions the assumptions of mainstream art, while
the political avant-garde confronts the place of art in society. Schrank holds the mods of Jodi.
org, an art collective known for deconstructing famous games until they are unrecognizable,
as the ideal of formal avant-garde games that work by manipulating the player’s flow state.
The political avant-garde in gaming is represented by virtual world griefers and alternatereality games, which call into question the magic circle that divides the “real” world from
the games we play.
Train seems to straddle these two avant-gardes. The game’s “reveal” moment, when the
Terminus card is turned over, has been proven over the game’s short life to cause a gameending shift in flow. If flow is the avoidance of both frustration and boredom, then Train’s

Game Analyses

reveal pushes the player so deep into frustration as to cause a feeling of futility. On the other
hand, Train troubles the notion of the magic circle in a number of ways. Even if we hold
that games aren’t inherently ethical systems, we can observe that some residue of historical
guilt sneaks into Train’s circle of play. And, although the “The Mechanic is the Message”
games stand on their own, we must nevertheless recognize their instrumental value—especially since we know that Brathwaite was inspired to begin the series when she saw that her
daughters weren’t receiving a satisfactory historical education at school.73
Conclusion
Charles Pratt, in his short review of Train, concludes that, “Perhaps it’s best to see Train not
as a game, but as move in a larger game played between the cultural forces of ‘fine art’ and
‘games.’”74 He seeks to move the discussion beyond a question of whether or not it’s a successful game design. With this piece, I hoped to show that the concepts of fine art and games
are in no way mutually exclusive; further, I wanted to find Train’s roots in the histories of
unstructured play and formal game design to see how and why it works as a game divorced
from its artistic aspirations.
Of course, it is unclear as of yet whether games will find a home in the artworld as members of an existing contemporary art movement, such as Nicolas Bourriaud’s “relational aesthetics,” or whether a new breed of ludic curators will have to gradually prove their worth
to buyers and critics alike.75 We also don’t yet know whether the theories of art espoused
by curators of games will adhere to or differ greatly from the ludological theories of game
studies academics. What’s important to remember is that the many cultural spheres at play
here don’t need to completely overlap: the artworld, the academy, and the industry can and
should all have their own unique valuations and judgments of game art. This is how it’s always been, yet our current analysis takes place in a strange time when many seem to desire
for all three discourses to eventually align.
I’d like to end now with a word of caution.
Train instills fear in me. It works on so many levels, answering so many questions about
the potential of games as design and art, that it threatens to dominate any and all discussion of those questions. We must always remember that Train’s methods and goals are not
the only methods and goals worthy of our best designers and their work. Not every game
needs to command our respect, to make us reflect on history, or to make us cry in order to be
worthy of aesthetic appreciation. Games are a mess, “a strew of inconvenient and sometimes
repellent things,” and we should strive to keep them that way.76

TWILIGHT STRUGGLE AND CARD-DRIVEN HISTORICITY
Pat Harrigan and Noah Wardrip-Fruin

Mark Herman’s We the People (1994) is generally regarded as the first wargame to use a truly Card-Driven System (CDS). Many previous wargames had incorporated card decks into
their design, but We the People was the first system to put the cards at the center of gameplay.
Cards in WtP are used for player movement, combat, and combat results, as well as other
events; in most earlier wargame designs, these mechanics would have been handled through
die rolls and a series of charts. Certain other design choices, such as the incorporation of a
point-to-point map instead of the traditional hex-based maps, helped to smooth gameplay
and reduce play time, resulting in a highly successful product for publisher Avalon Hill. Designers quickly adapted the CDS to other subjects; Avalon Hill shortly published two more
card-driven games by other designers, Mark Simonitch’s Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage (1996)
and Simonitch and Richard Berg’s Successors (1997). Since then many wargames have been
designed around some variation of the CDS, including Herman’s For the People (1998) and
Washington’s War (2010; a comprehensive redesign of his earlier We the People), Ted Raicer’s
Paths of Glory (1999), Herman and Stephen Newberg’s Empire of the Sun (2005; the first CDS
game to use the more traditional hex map), Chad Jensen’s Combat Commander series (2006on), and Ananda Gupta and Jason Matthews’s Twilight Struggle (2005), among many others.
Gupta and Matthews’s design differs from many earlier CDS games in that it is not, strictly speaking, a military simulation. Depending on one’s definition, it is not even a wargame.77
While Paths of Glory, for instance, models large-scale military operations in World War I Europe and the Near East, and the Combat Commander games model small-scale tactical engagements in various theaters of World War II, Twilight Struggle takes as its subject the Cold War
between the United States and the Soviet Union, covering the period 1945-1989.

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

Twilight Struggle, by simulating a global non-military conflict, demonstrates the flexibility of CDS game design. Although eminently playable and highly competitive, it adopts a
more linear style of gameplay than many other CDS games, striking an intriguing balance
between historical predictability and robust gameplay.78
For all its effectiveness as a historical simulation, Gupta and Matthews are clear that the
game reflects a certain perception of history, not history itself. In the first place, “winning” is
truly an option, unlike the murky outcomes of the real Cold War. Nor does the game reflect
any ideological differences within nations or their leadership, except as the limited effects of
certain card events, which do not meaningfully realign the geopolitical goals of either side.
Ideology, communist or capitalist, is unimportant, as are the local politics of nations except
insofar as they affect the wider game struggle. At the same time, one of the most compelling
features of Twilight Struggle is how it places players in a collage Cold War mindset, in which
competing historical ideologies are literally true and have definable in-game effects.
The game is played over a map of the globe, with individual nations represented as small
boxes connected to each other by lines. Nations are further grouped into political Regions:
Europe, Asia, Central America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East.79 This style of
“point-to-point” representation of map areas is common to many modern wargames, and
can be seen in We the People, For the People, Paths of Glory and many others. In CDS games, it
has largely though not completely supplanted the previously-standard “hex-based” style of
wargame maps.80 (Province/area movement is also common in CDS games, but this is topologically equivalent to point-to-point movement.)
Twilight Struggle, however, uses the point-to-point representation differently from these
other games. In military simulations such as Paths of Glory, a path between points (e.g., Liege
and Sedan) represents a possible line for armies to move and attack, as well as the path along
which an army can trace a supply route. By contrast, in Twilight Struggle those lines represent instead a sort of geopolitical affinity that channels certain player actions. For example,
a player’s Influence markers can usually only be placed in nations adjacent (connected by a
path) to ones in which he already has Influence. Further, when a player attempts a “Realignment roll” for a particular nation, the rolling player receives a bonus to his roll for any adjacent country he controls. In other words, if a player controls a nation near the target nation,
it is easier to realign the target or increase one’s influence there. This gameplay mechanic
specifically simulates the famous “domino theory” of Cold War geopolitics. Although essentially discredited as a theory among real-world scholars, the domino theory is absolutely
true within the internal logic of Twilight Struggle. For Gupta and Matthews, the domino theory is one part of a wider series of design decisions:
Also important for players to understand is that the game has a very definite point of
view. Twilight Struggle basically accepts all of the internal logic of the Cold War as
true—even those parts of it that are demonstrably false. Therefore, the only relationships that matter in this game are those between a nation and the superpowers. The
world provides a convenient chess board for US and Soviet ambitions, but all other nations are merely pawns (with perhaps the occasional bishop) in that game. Even China
is abstracted down to a card that is passed between the two countries. Furthermore, not
only does the domino theory work, it is a prerequisite for extending influence into a region. Historians would rightly dispute all of these assumptions, but in keeping with the
design philosophy, we think they make a better game (Gupta and Matthews 2005).81
This literalization of the domino theory could be seen as politically hawkish, but dovish attitudes are detectable in the treatment of the game’s DEFCON track. The game rules
require each player to perform a certain number of military actions each turn or suffer a

Game Analyses

penalty. But doing so raises tensions between the superpowers and risks degrading the DEFCON track further toward possible nuclear war. Any player who degrades the DEFCON
track to “1” triggers a nuclear war; that player immediately loses the game.
What would this gameplay look like in the real world? It presumes that the actors in the
game are constrained by the logic of the Cold War to constantly flex their military muscles,
even when doing so necessarily brings the globe closer to a nuclear holocaust. It implies
that the logic of mutually assured destruction is inescapable: the superpowers have limited
control over their own nuclear arsenals, and must respond in kind to any escalation of the
nuclear threat by the other side. Finally, it is inarguable that no rational actor would deliberately start such a war, in which the only guaranteed loser is himself, and which would immediately end the Cold War game and begin some much grimmer game of simple survival.
These attitudes are inherited from the anti-nuclear movements of the 1960s-1980s and
reflect their pessimistic logic. Twilight Struggle is, in fact, structurally more pessimistic than
any real-world anti-nuclear activist in that the logic of deterrence is hard-wired into the very
rules of the game. There is no way to escape the military-nuclear treadmill and still correctly
play the game.82
Twilight Struggle’s view of the Cold War is thus one formed from a modern sensibility, by
designers who grew up during the period described, but can now reflect on it with something like nostalgia.
Nostalgia, or something like it, permeates the game. Twilight Struggle simulates and recreates the major events of the Cold War; it does not attempt to speculate on or generate an
alternate Cold War history. In no possible Twilight Struggle scenario, for instance, can China
take the place of the US or the USSR as a primary superpower; nor is it possible for a popular
revolution to bring down the US or Soviet governments. (In earlier versions of the design,
Matthews and Gupta permitted a much more extreme range of outcomes for China. As with
many elements, this led to ahistorical gameplay, as players vastly overcommitted to influencing China.)
Insofar as Twilight Struggle deviates from history, it does so by abstracting or avoiding
real events, not generating an alternate global history. It is true that the ultimate historical
outcome can diverge, as when a game ends with the USSR winning, or the world being destroyed by nuclear war, but these are logical progressions from real-world historical events,
not science fictional ones. In recreating this real-world history so closely, Gupta and Matthews have necessarily limited certain strategic decisions available to the players. They have
done so by utilizing the CDS in specific ways.
To see exactly how they have done this, we can compare Twilight Struggle to the tactical
combat game Combat Commander: Europe (CC:E) for maximum contrast.
In CC:E, Allied and Axis players battle each other in one of a number of pregenerated scenarios, modeled on actual historical WWII combat engagements in the European theater.83
Unlike Twilight Struggle, games of CC:E are well-known for their unpredictability. In a game
of CC:E, several elements combine to limit a player’s possible opening moves. From most to
least constraining, they are:
• Game rules. Hard-wired rules constraints specify how many units can be placed in a
hex at a given time, how fast units can move, how far weapons can shoot, etc. To break
this constraint would be to play the game incorrectly.
• Optimal strategic choices. Often at the beginning of a scenario, there are clearly evident
good and bad choices that channel events into a small number of possible paths. It is
possible in Scenario 1 (“Fat Lipki”), for instance, for the German forces to reach a par-

161

162

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

ticular building on turn 1, and take advantage of its cover, only if they follow a strictly
optimized sequence of moves. To delay in this instance means that Russian forces can
advance far enough to make it very difficult for the Germans to take control of the
building, with severe consequences for the remainder of the game. This constraint
relaxes as a game moves from the initial stages, and unpredicted actions and events,
as well as strategic choices, proliferate.
• Historical accuracy. Each scenario is faithful to the geography of the terrain over which
the battle occurred, and forests, roads, buildings, etc., exist where they did historically.
In addition, the setup conditions of each scenario specify what troops and materiel
are available to the Allied and Axis players, and where they can be initially deployed.
This is a design constraint, not a gameplay one; gameplay will likely deviate from history within the first move or so.
As a game of CC:E progresses, the series of player choices, along with a large number of
random and unforeseeable events (a notable feature of the Combat Commander rules system),
make it so that a vast number of outcomes become possible. Twilight Struggle does not operate
in this way. While it is true that no one can predict, before the game begins, who will win,
there are a number of things that can be said in advance of any game of Twilight Struggle, as
a direct result of how Gupta and Matthews opted to utilize the CDS.
Twilight Struggle’s single card deck contrasts with certain other CDS games, such as Paths
of Glory or the Combat Commander series, which give each player a dedicated deck of cards.
Neither is there a separate “battle deck,” as in Hannibal, which players draw from to perform
tactical military operations.84 Instead, the single set of event cards used in Twilight Struggle
is drawn from by both the US and USSR player. The cards are divided into three sub-decks:
Early, Mid, and Late War. Players begin by using only the Early War deck; the later decks are
added at pre-established points in the game. This ensures that the game generally follows a
rough chronology—that the Korean War happens before the Vietnam War, for example. Furthermore, the playing of certain cards is a prerequisite for the playing of certain later ones:
the card “NATO” can only be played after either “Marshall Plan” or “Warsaw Pact.” Finally,
certain cards prevent the playing of later ones, as with “Camp David Accords,” which prevents the play of the card “Arab-Israeli War.”
But these are exceptions. For the most part, history in Twilight Struggle is modular, with
few cause-and-effect chains. In the logic of Twilight Struggle, the revolution in Cuba does not
lead to the Cuban Missile Crisis, but are both discrete cards (“Fidel” and “Cuban Missile Crisis”), which can happen, or not happen, independently from one another. This is illustrative
of Twilight Struggle’s approach to historicity: for playability, historical events are detached
from wider national and global concerns and their Cold War essence extracted, as it were, in
order to form a single playable Event.
Each card Event is beneficial for either the US or the USSR (or in some cases, both or
either). In addition to their Event, any card can be played for its Operations Point value.
Therefore, if the US player holds a card that shows a beneficial Event for himself, he has the
difficult choice of using it to trigger that Event, or to play it for the card’s more-flexible Operations points.85 However, a US player holding a card beneficial to the USSR has an even more
difficult choice, since playing the card for Operations points will still trigger the Event for the
other player. The choice then becomes when to play that particular Event card.
For example, the “Marshall Plan” card is worth four Operations Points, and can be used
as such by either the US or USSR player. But the card effect is helpful only to the US player,
allowing that player to add one Influence marker to each of seven non-USSR controlled na-

Game Analyses

tions in Western Europe, as well as allowing future play of the extremely useful “NATO”
card. If the USSR player held this card, he would never choose to play it for its effect, and
would likely choose to play it instead for its Operations Point value. But doing so will still
trigger the event: the US player will place his Influence, and the future play of the “NATO”
card is now allowable.
Because players must play nearly all of the cards in hand every turn, they are regularly
triggering these sorts of deleterious events. It is true that to a limited degree a player can
delay the play of a suboptimal card (by holding onto it until the next turn), or potentially
defuse its effects (by using it as a resource for the Space Race), but in most cases, a player will
find that he has a hand of cards composed of very few good choices.
The game contains 36 Early War cards, and as eight cards are dealt to each player each
turn, all of the Early War cards will have passed through the players’ hands at least once by
the third turn. Specific rules enforce the playing of the Europe Scoring, Asia Scoring, and
Middle East Scoring cards, so any experienced player will know that these cards will all be
played at least once during the first three turns.86 There are 46 Mid War cards, and—due to
a rule increasing to nine the number of cards dealt out to each player on a turn—they will
all be dealt out by turn six. The 21 Late War cards will also all see play in the following three
turns, and so every card in the game will have been dealt out at least once should the game
reach the final, tenth, turn.87 Twilight Struggle therefore is designed such that players will
have the opportunity to play most of the historical Events if they choose to do so.88
Since players have very limited ability to discard cards from their hand—CC:E, by contrast, allows for rapid card-cycling—and since the play of a card for Operations points will
often trigger an event beneficial to one’s opponents, any play of Twilight Struggle will see
many, if not most, of the card events triggered.
The rules that govern Event triggers are therefore modeled along a particular idea of
Cold War logic: that each action taken by one side will provoke a potentially more damaging
counter-action by the other side. Yet, agonizingly, the cards must be played.
The number and distribution of Victory points also provide incentives for players to be
active in all regions and indicate the emphasis each player should put on each region. Further, the value of a particular region often changes as the players move through the Early,
Mid and Late War decks. In this way the game inclines the players once again toward a realistic Cold War chronology: the game begins with Europe as the hot spot, but gradually the
importance shifts to Central America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, before spreading
into Africa in the late war.
We can see that the three initial gameplay constraints we identified for CC:E are here
present for the entirety of a Twilight Struggle play: Rules and limited strategic choices governing Event triggers combine to ensure a roughly-accurate historical experience; within this
framework of bad and suboptimal choices, one player will eventually squeak out a victory.
In a game of CC:E, we cannot know in advance who will win or much of what will happen
along the way. In Twilight Struggle, we can predict much of the action, but not the eventual
winner.
Finally, however, it is the very fact that one side or another will win—and do so based
on gameplay actions such as military operations, coups, realignments, controlling regions
of the world, and moving forward in the space race—that is both Twilight Struggle’s largest
deviation from history and its most necessary design element for placing players in a Cold
War mindset. Though it is certainly true that the US was the only superpower left standing

at the end of the Cold War, to play out how this actually occurred would require a radical
restructuring of the rules of the game, one that would compromise Twilight Struggle’s most
powerful accomplishment: drawing players through a recapitulation of most of the Cold
War’s dramatic events, in which they behave according to its internal historical logics.

77 In some respects, Twilight Struggle resembles a modern-style Eurogame more than a wargame. Like Settlers of

Catan, Tigris and Euphrates and countless other Eurogames, Twilight Struggle offers multiple scoring paths: Victory
points can be acquired through area control (Europe, South America, etc.), scored at irregular times during gameplay; via the Space Race and military operations tracks; and as the direct result of card events.
Matthews has said that the primary design influences on Twilight Struggle were Chris Crawford’s seminal computer game Balance of Power (for the futility of nuclear war); Gary Dicken and Steve Kendall’s board game History
of the World (for “presence,” “domination” and “control”); and many Euro-style games, in particular the games of
Alan Moon, for whom “scoring cards” are something of a trademark.
According to Gupta, Twilight Struggle’s military-nuclear treadmill derives in part from Robert J. Simpson’s 1984

Game Analyses
abstract modern-era geopolitical game Supremacy. In this lengthy game, player activity involves conquest with
conventional forces and includes a fairly strong strategic warfare component (e.g., nuclear weapons, anti-nuclear
technology, boomer subs, and chemical and biological weapons). But the game allowed for defeated players to
launch final strikes with their entire arsenals—causing everyone to lose. This game option was modified for Twilight Struggle, in which only the player who triggers a nuclear war is the loser.
Finally, Gupta adds that a major influence on Twilight Struggle’s domino theory mechanic was Mark Herman’s For
the People. In that game, the Union capital of Washington is much easier for the Confederate army to capture than
it would have been in real life. This is because For the People playtesters discovered that a historically accurate
defensive capability for Washington led to distorted force allocations, as the Union player lacked the sense of
urgency to defend the city that the real Union high command could not ignore. For Herman and later for Gupta
and Matthews, an unrealistic rule led to a better, more authentic mindset for the players, and thus to a more immersive game.
78 Much of what is written here can also be applied to Christian Leonhard and Jason Matthews’ board game 1960:

The Making of a President (2007, Z-Man Games), which simulates the electoral battle between John Kennedy and
Richard Nixon. In this later design, Twilight Struggle’s nations are replaced with the states of the Union, and electoral votes take the place of victory points. These and other rules refinements ensure that 1960’s design reflects its
subject matter. Matthews and other collaborators have further repurposed the basic Twilight Struggle design in the
games Campaign Manager 2008; 1989: Dawn of Freedom; and Founding Fathers.
79 China, as a powerful geopolitical entity that does not fit into the simplified gameplay duality of USA/USSR, is
broadly abstracted as a single physical card, the “China Card,” which provides certain advantages to the player
who holds it.

80 Notable exceptions are Mark Herman and Stephen Newberg’s Empire of the Sun, and Chad Jensen’s Combat Com-

mander series, the particularities of which are more suited to the use of old-style hex maps.
81 Compare with Combat Commander: Europe: “CC was born of a desire to make a game about WWII tactical in-

fantry warfare that had more feeling and flavor to it than pedantic historical detail. That is not to say the game is
unrealistic; just realistic in a broader, more visceral manner while abstracting things like caliber, rate of fire and
muzzle velocity into a more streamlined presentation (Jensen 2006).” Jensen explicitly compares CC:E to Ray Freeman’s Tigers in the Mist, about which Freeman has said that the design considerations were, first, a fun, playable,
challenging game; second, historical accuracy; and third, realism.
82 Though it is worth noting that nuclear war does not result in both players losing, which would be the anti-

nuclear position. However, as in Supremacy, this would provide an inappropriate outlet for players in a bad strategic position, allowing them to turn a likely individual loss into an assured shared loss, simply by pursuing the
maximal nuclear escalation that the current rules deter.
83 To increase gameplay possibilities, CC:E also includes rules for randomly-generated scenarios. Except for his-

torical fidelity, the same gameplay constraints apply to these.

84 Combat Commander’s card deck consists of generic tactical actions (Move, Fire, Advance, etc.), and can be seen

as an expanded version of Hannibal’s battle deck. Even CC’s less-generic card Actions and Events are all tactical
in nature.
85 Operations Points can be used in four ways: “To place Influence markers, to make Realignment rolls, to attempt

Coups, or to attempt advancement in the Space Race” (Gupta and Matthews 2005). The first three of these are
functionally different in the game rules, but can be thought of in real-world terms as a range of international intervention activities ranging from propaganda and political pressure to overt or covert military actions. The Space
Race functions as a sort of sub-game in Twilight Struggle, allowing players to use Operations points for a chance at
gaining Victory Points and other special benefits.
86 This semi-predictable scoring also serves to model Cold War paranoia. Players begin to wonder why their op-

ponent is focusing his attention on a particular region—is it because he has the scoring card for that region? The
player then responds by focusing his own resources on that region, which begins a mutually reinforcing feedback
loop, with both players escalating their attention on a region that might well have very little value to either side.
87 Unpredictability is still present via the “Wargames” card, which lets a player win the game abruptly if he has

165

166

Tabletop: Analog Game Design
a sufficient margin of victory. This makes it impossible to play entirely for the endgame position with its arbitrary
time limit (unless, of course, “Wargames” is in the discard pile—expert players will often hold the card to keep
opponents in the dark about when the game might end).
88 Paths of Glory also approximates historical chronology in this way, by further dividing its two decks of Allied

and Central Powers Strategy cards into Mobilization, Limited War and Total War decks, most of which will see
play in any reasonably lengthy game. However, Events are less likely to be played than in Twilight Struggle, since in
addition to an Event, each card has values for Operations Points, Replacement Points and Strategic Redeployment
points, and a player must decide which of these he will use with each card play. All of this, as well as the wealth of
strategic options presented by possible movements of units on the board, make each player’s every turn an agony
of difficult decisions. There is always too much to do, and too few resources. This models the difficulty of WWI
military command in a way similar to how Twilight Struggle models its Cold War logic.

UNDERSTANDING STRATEGIC BOARDGAMES AS COMPUTATIONALTHINKING TRAINING MACHINES
Matthew Berland

Playing strategic tabletop games requires that individuals think like a computer. It requires
that players follow a set of relatively uncomplicated rules with a few (relatively circumscribed) decision points for which players have voluminous data. However, humans have a
difficult time writing succinct rules, understanding rules, and/or enacting the rules of these
games (Berland & Lee, 2010). As game designers and players know, writing effective instructions is a key (often overlooked) challenge of game production. Even with effective instructions, novice players of almost any strategic boardgame will undoubtedly make several rule
errors, (mis)communicate their idiosyncratic understandings, and generally create a mess of
even a very well designed game.
This essay details the ways in which the thinking involved in playing strategic boardgames relates to computational thinking, both in terms of the algorithms that players must
learn, and the types of bugs they generate and fix. These parallels suggest that players of
boardgames are engaged in computational thinking, without ever touching a computer. I
therefore posit that strategic tabletop games are a productive way for humans to learn the basic elements of computational thinking—that tabletop games can be computational-thinking
training machines.
Computation With Or Without Computers: Computational Literacy
The ability to use computation as a ‘lens’ for thinking and learning is called ‘computational’ or ‘procedural’ literacy.89 Papert (1980) used the term procedural literacy to propose
that all students be taught to program and to use computer programming as a means to
think and learn about math, science, and even literature. More recently, Bogost (2007) and
Mateas (2008) have taken up the mantle of procedural literacy as a way to express how stu-

dents learn to think with videogames, by virtually inhabiting their rule-based worlds. This
work builds upon that work by adapting it to an analog space. Both the work on procedural
literacy and this work stem, in part, from work by constructionists such as diSessa (2001);
diSessa argues that computational literacy can be understood in terms of three core components: the social, the cognitive, and the material. Material computational literacy is being
able to use the tools of computer science and computation to solve problems. At this point,
boardgames are unhelpful in teaching material computational literacy – no boardgame on
the market will teach you computer programming or modeling. However, games are much
better suited to social and cognitive computational literacies. Cognitive computational literacy is being able to think computationally. Social computational literacy is being able to
communicate about computation. This essay explores the ways that strategic tabletop games
engender the cognitive and social aspects of computational (or procedural) literacy.
Cognitive Computational Literacy: Computational Thinking
Cognitive computation focuses on creating, understanding, following and debugging
rules. It is fundamentally about the enactment of explicit sets of instructions in a specified
order. We call these instruction sets algorithms. An example of an algorithm might be:
• Roll the dice
• If you roll a seven, move the robber and enact the robber rules.
• Otherwise, deal resources matching the rolled number to the appropriate player
• The player who rolled can now enact one of three rule sets: building, trading, or playing cards.
These, not coincidentally, are the rules for Settlers of Catan (Teuber, 1995) phrased in a
computer code idiom.90 In this example, at least five different computational concepts are
required for understanding and following these instructions. Table 1 exemplifies these concepts by depicting the rules in both pseudocode (‘human readable program code’) and the
rules of the game.

Imperative
Ordering

In both computer programming and
tabletop games, the order of instructions is paramount.

(see any of the example above.)

1. Roll the dice
2. If you roll a 7, move
the robber and enact
the robber rules.

Looping

Do some specified sub-set of the
instructions repeatedly, until some
end condition is met.

while not done:
foreach player:
enact_turn();

Go player by player, allowing each one a turn
until the game is done.

However, it can be difficult for humans to enact these rules. In earlier work (Berland &
Lee, 2010; Berland, Lee, & DuMont, 2010), we showed how novices playing a game of Pandemic
(Leacock, 2008) encountered several fundamentally computational problems, and how they
solved those problems using debugging techniques relatively similar to those in computer
programming. These bugs shed light on how players understand the game. The table below
presents potential bugs resulting from the active player rolling a seven in Settlers of Catan:
Action

Problem

Rule in game (summarized)

Robber is placed back on
the ‘desert’ title.

Misapprehension of a (sub-) rule

The robber must be moved upon rolling a 7,
but it cannot be placed on the desert tile.

Players with 9 cards keep
5, rather than 4

“Off by one” -- a common error in
computer programming.

Any player with more than 7 cards can only
keep half, rounded down.

Players who did not roll
are trading.

Not following rules that seem unnecessarily runitive or “un-fun.”

The active player must be involved in any
trade on his/her turn.

The problems are inherent to the context; humans are not explicitly rule-comprehension
or rule-following machines. The main reason that a human would work to follow a rule
without error when playing a game for fun is if s/he believes that the game will be more fun
when the rules are perfectly followed. If this is not the case, players will change or ignore the
rules. These are (perhaps paradoxically) the core strengths of the environment:
• Computational thinking is socially reinforced.
• Rule modification (or ‘computer programming’) is socially reinforced
