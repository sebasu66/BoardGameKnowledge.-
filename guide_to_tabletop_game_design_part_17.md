important as what to do while you are designing it. There is a saying in the industry:
“Fail faster.” This means the faster you fail at your design, then the faster you can
decide whether to keep working on it (the “fail” is fixable) or discard it (the “fail” is not
fixable). Don’t be precious about your game ideas. You will have more ideas, so don’t be
afraid to start over.
Take a break: Take a walk. Take a shower. Take a nap. Go to the movies. Go for a
drive. Get some chores done. Do anything but design a game. Sometimes your creative
brain needs rest too. Give it a chance to recharge, and it will be ready to go when you are.
Avoid dwelling on the negative: All creative people are very hard on themselves.
Remember that you will fail. Not all your designs will be good. Some games will never be
bought by a publisher, but that’s okay. All game designers experience this. Instead,
focus on your victories, no matter how small. Did you design one card today? Awesome!
Did you put stickers onto blank dice! Congratulations! These little steps are just as
important as the big events like finishing a design or publishing a game. Take time to
celebrate.

One Last Bit of Advice
Done is better than good.
You can spend a lot of time trying to think of an original idea for a game. Ideas are cheap. I
just came up with five totally original game ideas just a few pages ago.
You can spend a lot of time making your game perfect and making sure everything is just
right for the players. But perfection is a fool’s errand. There’s no such thing as a perfect game.
Go look on Board Game Geek. There’s always someone complaining about a game, even the
highest rated ones!
You can spend a lot of time playtesting your game, but you can fall into a trap of never finishing your game. You are just polishing it over and over and over again. And what happens if
you polish something for too long? You wear it down.
The difference between a novice and professional game designer is that they know when to
stop. When their game is done. To be honest, you’ll never really be done with a game, but you
should know when to “ship it.”
Only games that are done get played. Only games that are done get published. You can celebrate when your game is done.

L e t ’s Ma ke a Game
P ro to t y ping K i t!
I HAVE A friend, Seth Johnson, who is a professional tabletop game designer. We were
having lunch at Gen-­Con, the big tabletop gaming convention, and talking about game ideas.
At one point in the conversation, he said, “That’s a great idea. I think I should make it!” He
pulled out a little box that was filled with all types of useful tools to help him make games. By
that evening he had a playable prototype. I was very impressed, not just because he was talented enough to take an idea and create a prototype in a few hours but that he carried all the
tools that were needed to make a quick game prototype.
A good game prototyping kit is like Batman’s utility belt—­it’s filled with all sorts of useful
tools that help you solve any problem or realize any idea that you might have. What goes into
a good game prototyping kit? I’m glad you asked!
First, you will need a box of some sort. I suggest something that has a latch on it—­like a sewing box or a fisherman’s tackle box. Remember, you don’t want it to be so big that you can’t
carry it around with you, and it is helpful if it has a handle.
Next you will need materials to create a game. Start with a DECK OF PLAYING CARDS. In
addition to being able to play thousands of games with playing cards, they have also helped
inspire game designers for decades. You can find cheap decks of cards just about anywhere,
from hobby stores to dollar stores. Since a pack of playing cards costs around $1–2, you won’t
feel bad about defacing them if you want to write on them or put stickers or tape over them.
You will also want a PACK OF INDEX CARDS. While they are slightly larger than playing
cards, they are also very inexpensive and come in a variety of colors. I recommend buying
index cards that are blank on both sides rather than having those horizontal lines. Get what
you can afford. Index cards can always be cut down to other sizes, and they are so inexpensive you won’t feel bad if you screw up and have to throw one (or several) of these rough
cards away.

400

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

If you are a big nerd like me, you have lots of COMIC BOOK BACKING BOARDS lying around
your house. They are a little more expensive than index cards and a lot bigger, but I find them
useful. First, they are stiffer than index cards (they are the same thickness as “Bristol Board”
that you can find in art supply stores), and they are bigger. With some scissors, you can make
them into cards or tiles or standees or player mats or tape several together to make a board.
Wow, I just mentioned a whole bunch of other things to add into our box: TAPE and
SCISSORS. If you prefer, you could use a CRAFT KNIFE like an Xacto blade and a METAL
RULER to cut straight lines.
If you want to make some cheap and easy homemade cards, I suggest buying CARD SLEEVES,
which you can buy at any comic book or gaming store (or online). You can cut your index
cards to fit into them. Sleeving the card (which means that you slide your card into a card
sleeve) gives you a slightly stiffer card that is easier to shuffle and also feels better in your
hand. A colored sleeve also makes it so that the index card cannot be seen through, so that
way the players can’t cheat by looking through the card.
These supplies are not meant to be permanent. They are just tools to get you to a playable
version of your idea. The faster you build your prototype, the faster you can determine if it is
fun or not. Many designers just use simple colors and numbers to convey the information;
others will draw on the cards instead. It’s up to you which you want. Personally, I like to draw
on cards because I like to draw!
What do you use to draw? A PENCIL, of course! And don’t forget the PENCIL SHARPENER.
Many designers prefer using these because, well, you can erase pencil marks! It’s important
to change and revise information as you go, because you will make mistakes, find out that a
value should be lower or higher than you originally wrote, or change the card’s name. Don’t
forget the ERASER to get rid of those mistakes. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. It’s the
best way to learn. And once you’ve learned from your mistakes, you tend not to repeat them,
and you become a better designer in the process!
Let’s not forget a PEN. I suggest that you use two different types of pens. First you want a fine
tip pen like a Micron pen. This is for writing information or drawing. Then you want a fatter
MARKER like the ones Sharpie makes. These fatter pens are great for writing something that
people need to see at a distance like numbers and symbols. Both of these pens come in a wide
variety of colors. My friend, Seth, always carries pens in four different colors. Why? Because
that way he can give each player a different color and make a game for up to four players.
You also want to carry DICE. The dice can have 4 sides, 6 sides, 8 sides, 10 sides, 20 sides. You
can find 6-­sided dice just about anywhere, and you can buy some of those crazier dice at a gaming store or online. Seth carries at least two dice in each of the four colors that he has in pens.

APPENDIX

LET’S MAKE A GAME PROTOTYPING KIT!

That’s a really smart idea because then each player can color-­code their dice! I like to carry
BLANK DICE, which you can buy online, that allows you to draw onto if you want to have custom symbols or different colors on one die.
TOKENS are useful, especially if you want to make a game with betting or resources or if you
want to mark something on a board. You could also use COINS instead. You can also use different colored ACRYLIC GEMS like the kind you can find at a hobby store. You could use
POKER CHIPS in different colors or draw on them with your pens or put stickers on them
and draw on those if you want. Oh yeah, you will want blank WHITE STICKERS (like the
kind you use as name tags at social events) to customize things such as playing cards, dice, or
poker chips.
You might need WOODEN CUBES of a variety of colors—­I often will have at least six different colors and at least 12 to 20 cubes of each color. I find that they work great as resources or
counters. Wooden MEEPLES of various colors are great too. I usually have four to six
meeples of six different colors. Or you can have MINIATURES instead—­often fantasy or sci­fi characters, although I carry “generic human” miniatures like those found in Betrayal at
House on the Hill or Clue.
You’ll want somewhere to write down the rules to your game, which is where that
SKETCHBOOK (or notebook) you’ve been carrying around comes in handy!
Finally, I suggest having resealable PLASTIC BAGS to prevent these components from spilling out or to keep them all together once you’ve earmarked them for a specific design you’re
working on.
Here’s a handy-­dandy checklist you can use to make your own game prototyping kit:
■■ STORAGE BOX
■■ DECK OF PLAYING CARDS
■■ 100 INDEX CARDS
■■ 4 colors of PENS (I recommend black, blue, red, and green)
■■ PENCIL
■■ PENCIL SHARPENER
■■ ERASER
■■ SCISSORS
■■ TAPE
■■ DICE (at least 4 six sided of colors that match your pens)
■■ POKER CHIPS/TOKENS/COINS/ACRYLIC GEMS (at least 20)
■■ BLANK STICKERS (several)
■■ SKETCHBOOK or NOTEBOOK
■■ RESEALABLE PLASTIC BAGS

THE FOLLOWING ARE four examples of sell-­sheets that I’ve created to promote (and
even sell!) my games to publishers. These will help give you an idea of what is expected as you
create your own. You can find templates to help you create your own sell-­sheets at mrboss

Who’s Hue?
(2015; published as Pantone the Game, 2018)
The sell-­sheet for Who’s Hue? is about as basic as you can create. It’s got a title/logo, a short
description of the game, photos of the prototype that illustrate the gameplay, a list of components, the three essentials, and the designer’s contact information. Consider this the bare
minimum for a sell-­sheet. The question to ask yourself is, even though it conveys all of the
necessary information to a publisher, will the sell-­sheet get them excited?

Dynamite Ridge Railroad
(Unpublished)
The Dynamite Ridge Railroad sell-­sheet presented is much more complex than the previous
one. All the usual information is listed including game outline, three essentials, components,
and contact information. The sideways orientation of the sell-­sheet allowed more of the
gameplay to be explained. Taking photographs of the prototype “in action” helps the publisher understand the game, but remember, a sell-­sheet is not a rule book; it’s just a tool to
get the publisher interested in learning more about your game.

Castle Climbers
(2024)
I wanted the Castle Climbers sell-­sheet to show off one of the game’s more interesting
features—­the vertical castle that gets built during the game. At one point, the sell-­sheet
included corresponding numbers and arrows pointing to each of the features of the gameplay, but it was too busy and took away from the images of the game.
It is possible to overcomplicate a sell-­sheet. This sell-­sheet went through many iterations and
designs. You can see my progress at mrbossdesign.blogspot.com/2020/09/

A Town Called Showdown
(Unpublished)
If your game has a strong theme, run with it! From the western font to the language used to
the bullet-­hole bullet points, I wanted the sell-­sheet for the game A Town Called Showdown to
scream “Wild West.”
I’m pleased with how this turned out. Many publishers have mentioned that this is their
favorite sell-­sheet. (Now if one of them would publish the game!)
