Because of nonstop nature of Real-Time Games, they are often structured
with two phases: Action and Resolution. Action is when the real-time action
occurs. After a condition is met, typically a timer expiring, but possibly when
a task is completed, or when a hand or deck of cards is exhausted, there is a
Resolution phase. In this phase, results of the action phase are determined,
without any time pressure. This two-mode approach allows for complex
mechanisms that might otherwise not be possible.
There are typically two types of endings to a real-time phase. In the first,
whenever the end-phase condition is met, the phase ends immediately. Players
are informed that it is over, and that is that. Spit (aka Speed or Blitz) and PickA-Polar Bear are both triggered when one player reaches a particular game
state (all cards gone from their deck in Spit, and no more legal options to take
a card in Polar Bear). At that time, the phase instantly completes.
Some games use the phase-end trigger to set up “bonus time” for the other
players, informing them that they have a set amount of additional time before
the phase ends. For example, in Show & Tile, the first player to complete their
artwork flips a sand timer. When that timer runs out, the artwork phase is
over, and players proceed to the guessing phase. Other games flip this dynamic
around, and give players who finish early an additional bonus task that must

48

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

be completed by the time all players finish the core task. In Pit Crew, when a
team finishes the real-time task of repairing its car and getting it out on the
track, the team switches to rolling a die to move the car, rolling over and over.
Meanwhile, the other teams continue to repair their car, and start rolling their
own die if other teams are still working. The last team to finish does not roll
its die, but stops all other teams from rolling. This puts added pressure and
tension on the teams who are still working on their repairs while others move
around the track, and adds some narrative arc to the activity.

Punctuated Real-Time

Description
There are no turns. Players play as quickly as possible, subject to certain
constraints, until the game or phase is completed. Play is also interrupted
by specific player actions, which are resolved before resuming the real-time
action.

Discussion
Punctuated Real-Time is a variation on real-time (TRN-07), and the
difference is subtle. Whereas in a real-time game the action stops when some
condition is met—a timer going off, or a deck exhausting—in a Punctuated
Real-Time Game, the action may be stopped at any time, at the discretion of
a player, or upon taking a valid stopping action.
In Space Cadets: Dice Duel and Captain Sonar, players stop the action by
shouting something (“Fire Torpedoes” or “Launch Mine”), and all players
stop what they are doing to resolve the action.
To a certain extent, this mechanism is also present in the early twentieth
century game Pit, as players end the real-time trading portion by hitting a
bell, after which the round is evaluated. Also dating back over a hundred
years, baseball and American football are also exemplars of Punctuated RealTime, where teams can plan, organize, substitute, and catch their breath prior
to initiating the next pitch or play.
Punctuated Real-Time adds an additional layer of tension to what is already
the tense mechanism of real-time. Players do not necessarily see the stoppage

50

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

of play coming. In Pit, you don’t know how close the other players are to
winning the round. It also gives more flexibility to the designer on a number
of levels. First, it allows for the inclusion of more complex mechanisms, as
they can be resolved during the “stoppage time.” Firing a torpedo in Captain
Sonar falls into this category, as the resolution can include complexity that
would normally be beyond what is reasonable in a Real-Time Game.
Second, Punctuated Real-Time allows the game to be longer, as the
stoppage time gives players an opportunity to catch their breath, or even get
a snack or go to the restroom. In a fully Real-Time Game such as Escape:
The Curse of the Temple, action that continues more than 10–20 minutes
or so risks exhausting and overwhelming the player. Punctuated Real-Time
gives the designer a tool to created nonscheduled breaks to give the players a
breather, allowing for a longer, more complex and textured overall experience.

Simultaneous Action Selection

Description
Players plan their turn simultaneously and secretly. Then, they reveal their
plans at the same time.

Discussion
A Simultaneous Action Selection Game has players selecting actions at the
same time, but actions are generally resolved in turn order. The action-selection
mechanism will usually include a sub-system for determining the order by
which the action resolution phase will be played. For example, in Libertalia,
players choose a role card from their hand, and play it face down. Then, all
cards are revealed simultaneously, and the lowest-numbered card revealed is
resolved first. Each player in Libertalia has the same role cards in their hands,
so duplicate plays occur frequently. To resolve these ties, each card also shows
a unique priority number. Robo Rally, a classic in the genre, uses a similar
priority number mechanism to sequence the players once cards are revealed.
Priority numbers are not necessarily required for Simultaneous Action
Selection. Race for the Galaxy has players simultaneously select which roles
they would like to execute, but then the roles are always performed in a specific
order. See the Role Order mechanism for more details (TRN-10).
Typically, cards are used to implement this mechanism, although other
game objects, such as tiles or dice, can also be used. In Incan Gold, each turn

52

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

players simultaneously decide whether they are going to remain in the cave
or return to camp. In the original version (called Diamant) players indicated
this choice by secretly holding their wooden adventurer figure in their hand
or having an empty fist. Later versions replaced this with placing a “Stay”
or “Go” card face down. In the A Game of Thrones board game, actions are
planned using order tokens that are placed face down, and then revealed by
flipping them all face up.
This mechanism gives players the opportunity to try to anticipate what their
opponents will do, and plan accordingly. The general term for mechanisms
which have players trying to guess what their opponents will do is called “Yomi,”
a Japanese word. We discuss Yomi in more detail in UNC-01.
Simultaneous Action Selection can also speed up games and reduce
downtime, as players are acting simultaneously. However, if the planning
is extensive, as in Diplomacy and A Game of Thrones, it can give room for
Negotiation (ECO-18) and increased strategy, which adds length.

Role Order

Description
Players secretly and simultaneously select an action, role, or priority. Then
they are revealed, and the actions/roles revealed determine the order in which
players act.

Discussion
Role Order is a subset of Simultaneous Action Selection (TRN-09). There
are several ways to implement this mechanism. Citadels, for example, has
players draft roles (like Thief or Assassin). There is one card for each role in a
deck. Some of the roles are removed without any of the players knowing their
identity. The first player then looks at the remaining roles, chooses one, and
passes the remaining cards to the left.
After each player has selected a role, the first player calls out the roles from
first to last, according to their number. Thief, for example, is number two. If
a player has that role, he or she reveals it and takes that action.
Race for the Galaxy has a different approach. Each player simultaneously
selects which of the roles (like Explore or Settle) they wish to play. Then all
players reveal their choice. The roles are resolved in a defined order (e.g.,
Explore is always first). For each role that is chosen by at least one player,
all players get to perform it, but the player(s) who chose it get a bonus via a

54

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

more powerful version of the action. More on this in the Follow mechanism
(ACT-08).
If no one selects a role, it is skipped, so if players really want a specific role to
occur, they can select it, or gamble that, based on the situation, other players
are likely to select it, affording them the opportunity to choose something
else. This introduces an element of Yomi (UNC-01), as players attempt to
outguess each other.
In both of these games, players are not guaranteed that certain roles will
occur. This is typical of implementations of this mechanism, as a result of
the hidden role selection—if all the roles were in play, players could readily
deduce which roles were taken before them.
Using Role Order allows Citadels to introduce an interesting twist. The
player who chooses the Assassin role names another role that will have to lose
a turn. Note that it is the role that is targeted, not the player. Players losing
their turn is an anti-pattern (TRN-16) that usually results in negative feelings
as it gets in the way of doing the activity they sat down to play. However, in
Citadels, the role is targeted, not a specific player. While the Assassin players
may have an idea of who may be more likely to choose a role, they are not sure.
Additionally, the role the Assassin names may not even have been selected that
turn, rendering the ability moot.
Role Order allows the designers to control the order in which operations
occur, while giving players a choice about which of those will happen. It also
introduces a well-defined turn order that doesn’t suffer from needing to have
a mechanism to shift the first player. It happens naturally.

Random Turn Order

Description
Representatives of play pieces or players are randomized, and one is drawn
at a time. That player or play piece takes its turn, then a new random draw
is made.

Discussion
Random Turn Order can introduce a lot of excitement and tension to a game,
as players anxiously await which token will be revealed next. However, it also
reduces the ability of the players to plan effectively, which makes it most effective
in lighter games. Games are more tactical, as players need to react to the situation
as it develops, because they can’t predict when their turn will come.
There are ways to increase the ability for strategic planning when using
a Random Turn Order. Pillars of the Earth is a Worker Placement game
(Chapter 9), where workers are pulled from a bag. As with most Worker
Placement games, going early is an advantage, as more and better options
are available. When a player’s piece is pulled, if that player wishes to place it,
they need to pay a cost. This cost starts high, and gradually drops throughout
the turn. If a player does not want to (or cannot) pay the cost, the worker is
placed to the side, and is used to select an action at the very end of the turn.
This presents players with an interesting strategic option of trying to judge
the value of going early. The higher price of going early counteracts the luck
of being drawn early.
In Warrior Knights, actions are represented by cards. Each player selects two
cards from their personal deck that they wish to use that turn. The selections

56

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

from all the players are shuffled together and then they are drawn one at a
time, and the player whose card is chosen performs the corresponding action.
The inability to create a perfect plan has made this a popular mechanism
in war games. Rather than one player moving all pieces, and then the next
player moving all of theirs, a random draw for who gets to activate next helps
simulate battlefield uncertainty, while also reducing downtime for the players.
Firepower implements this type of chit-pull system.
Random Turn Order also gives the war game designer flexibility in
modeling superior and inferior units. For example, in the game A Victory Lost:
Crisis in Ukraine 1942-1943, Activation Chits for units are placed into a cup.
But veteran units receive multiple chits, while new recruits may receive only
one, modeling in a natural way the increased effectiveness of the veterans.
This is a kind of Deck Building system (CAR-05).
Another technique is to include wild card or category tokens, which give
the player a choice of which unit to activate when they are pulled, as long
as they correspond to the matching category. This also increases tactical
flexibility and reduces the luck factor. Battle Masters is an example of a game
that uses this approach.

Action Timer

Description
Players place owned timers on action spaces and pieces and take an action. When
the timer runs out, it may be moved to another location to take that action. There
are no turns; players may move their own timers any time after they have expired.

Discussion
This Action Timer mechanism is typically implemented with sand timers. Timers
allow for a real-time feel (TRN-07), while mitigating their frantic nature. It allows
the game to flow naturally, while giving players some structure and breathing
room to plan their next actions. As such, they can be used for longer periods of
times than would be desirable in a traditional real-time game.
Sand timers can be placed onto fixed spaces on the board to indicate what
actions the players are allowed to take, or onto specific pieces that move
around. In Time ‘n’ Space (a remake of the classic Space Dealer), sand timers
may be placed into a player’s base for research and other actions, or directly
onto a spaceship to allow it to move. Similarly, in War Time, the sand timers
are placed directly on the units, which allows them to move or attack.
Typically, the action is taken when the timer is placed. This allows the player
to place the timer, then actually do the action (take cubes, gain a research card,
perform an attack, move a unit, etc.) while the sands are running. This reduces
overall downtime for the players. If you wait for the timer to end before doing the
action, players will typically quickly move the timer to a new action to get it going,
then go back and execute the original action, which can add some confusion.
In spite of this mechanism being real-time, it can have a fair amount of
downtime for the players and feels sluggish at points as players are watching
the grains to get ready to do their next action. To help mitigate this, players

58

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

usually have multiple sand timers to use, to allow for action combos, and
move things along.
Some games also give players timers of varying durations. In Wartime: The
Battle of Valyance Vale, players have 30, 60, and 90 second timers, and each can
be used for any unit. Deciding which to use adds an additional tactical layer, and
also helps give the player more to do while waiting for other timers to run out.
TAMSK is an abstract game that takes a unique approach to using sand
timers. The pieces are sand timers, and when they make a move the timers
are flipped. A key element is that if a timer runs out of sand, it is locked into
place. This gives players tactical options of how to use the timers, and how
much time they have to think about decisions. A piece that is moved again
shortly after being moved will only have a little time remaining in the timer.
There are a number of physical issues that need to be dealt with in these
games. First, when players interact with each other, there can be contention
about which timer finished first, and so which player might be able to take
an action space or launch an attack first. This can be difficult to adjudicate in
the midst of the game, as timers will continue to run.
Also, while a real-time can be stopped by mutual agreement of the players,
this is harder with a sand timer game. The sand timers need to all be tipped over,
which can take some time and also change the way the sand is distributed while
they lie on their sides—to say nothing of their chances of rolling off the table!
Finally, there are manufacturing variations with sand timers that can lead to
a timing difference of many seconds. A 30-second timer may actually take as
long as 40 seconds to run. Indeed, the same sand timer may run faster or slower
depending on the irregularity of the grains in it and how they happen to fall.
Many timers have different run times depending on which side is up. These
variations need to either simply be accepted, or some type of manufacturing
screening process needs to be implemented, which will add cost to production.
In spite of these issues, sand timer games have a unique feel that deserves
further exploration by designers. Apps and other digital-analog hybrids hold
some promise here as well.

Time Track

Description
There is a linear “Time Track” with many spaces. Each player has a marker
on the track, which indicates where they are “in time.” Markers farther on
the track are further forward in time.
The player with the marker lowest on the track (furthest “back in time”)
takes the next action. Each action has a cost in time, and the player’s marker
is advanced a number of spaces according to that cost. Then, the next lowest
marker on the track takes an action. It is possible that the same player takes
multiple turns in a row.

Discussion
Time Tracks have a number of inherent advantages:
• Clarity: It is obvious who goes next, even though turn order jumps
around a lot.
• Player Control: Players have some choice over who goes next, allowing
for additional tactical play.
• Balance: The designer can include powerful actions, but can give them
a long time duration to compensate.
However, there are, of course, downsides to this technique. It can lead to
players being out of the action for some time if they have taken long-duration
options. Admittedly, they have chosen to do this, but an option available to
players should not result in them having a less enjoyable experience.
To prevent this situation, designers typically do not include very long
duration activities. However, this compression of durations into a narrower
range works against the benefits and promise of this system, as players usually

60

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

are quite close together on the Time Track. The Dragon & Flagon, for example,
has actions that range from 1 to 4 Time. Most of the actions in Thebes are in a
similar range, although players can opt to dig for artifacts for up to 12 Time,
which will give their opponents the opportunity to perform many actions
before their turn comes around again.
Because of this tight duration grouping, players frequently will share a
space on the Time Track. These ties are usually resolved by having the player
on top of the stack (the last piece to arrive there) move first. However, this
“Last-in-First-out,” or LIFO, system will give players guaranteed double
moves in some situations. Depending on the game, this may not be an issue,
and may even be desirable. But for some, it may be too powerful and some
mediation needs to happen. In The Dragon and Flagon, for example, Turn
Order is randomly determined when multiple players share the same space.
Another alternative is to only allow one piece per space on the Time
Track, forcing players who would otherwise occupy a space to move one or
more spaces further forward until they find an empty space. This can add an
extra layer of decision making, as the actual cost of certain actions may vary
based on the positioning of the opponent. Glen More and Kraftwagen use
this system. When the game offers only a limited amount of time, or creates
triggers based on specific spaces on the track, the particulars of how ties are
handled and whether players skip spaces become especially important.
High Rise combines a Time Track with an Action Selection mechanism.
Each space on the Time Track has an associated action. When players move
to the space, they execute the Action. The player furthest back on the track
moves first, and two players may not occupy the same space, giving players
the choice of moving far forward to guarantee a needed action, but potentially
giving their opponents multiple turns.

Passed Action Token

Description
Players possess one or more Action Tokens. Those who have an Action Token
may take a turn, then they pass the token clockwise, allowing the next player
to perform an action. Actions are performed in real time; there is no pausing
and structure within the turn.
Typically, to prevent stalling and to keep the game moving, in games with
multiple Action Tokens, if both tokens are held by the same player, then they
suffer a penalty.

Discussion
This mechanism is a cross between a real-time-based and a turn-based game.
Similar to the Action Timer mechanism (TRN-12), it allows players to play
at their own pace, and asynchronously, but gives some structure.
However, in the Action Timer mechanism, the players are basically
independent of each other, and can operate simultaneously. Here, players are
linked more closely, in that your turn can only start when the player before
you in turn order finishes his or her turn. This helps solve the dilemma of
players breaking rules (either inadvertently or deliberately) that is present in

62

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

other real-time mechanisms by having some players be inactive and able to
watch what other players are doing and interrupt if necessary. This allows for
more complex mechanisms within the game itself as opposed to traditional
real-time games.
For the most part, in order for this mechanism to work, there needs
to be multiple Action Tokens being passed around the circle at the same
time. The exception is if the round itself is timed in some fashion and
having possession of the Action Token causes a player to lose. Hot Potato
and Catch Phrase! are examples of this, where the player holding the item
when time runs out loses.
When using multiple Action Tokens, a key design element is what
happens if multiple tokens end up with the same player. In Camelot, if
another token would be passed to a player who already has one, it instead
skips that player and goes to the person to his or her left. This is equivalent
to losing a turn, as other players will get to act a second time before the
affected player. While we recommend against players losing a turn and
classify it as an anti-pattern (TRN-16), in this case the opportunity to
avoid losing a turn lies with the player, and is not luck-based. Therefore,
it is an understandable and satisfying solution to use in this case. It forces
players to move at a reasonable pace, at least comparable in speed to the
other players.
Yet, it does not mean that fast players will always win, depending on the
design of the game. If a reasonably thought out single move will beat a hasty
double move, then the system will be fine, as just doing something as quickly
as possible will not be rewarded. The players will need to balance “optimal”
and “good enough.”
An alternative system is seen in Diner. In this game, if a second Action
Token ends up with the same player, it just sits there until he or she completes
his or her move, and pass the first token to the next player. There is no
“lapping” as there is in Camelot. This can lead to slower and more conservative
play, but in this game it is helped by forcing players to compete to take shared
cards in a central tableau, so playing slowly in general will allow the other
players to grab more desirable cards.
It is also possible to use this as an overlay or subset of another structure.
Space Cadets uses a real-time turn structure, but in certain situations an
Action Token (a small deck of cards in this case) is passed around to allow
players to perform a special action beyond what they can normally do.
Eclipse uses two Action Tokens in a variant mode that can accommodate
as many as 9 players. The only distinction between the tokens is that one

provides priority over the other for acquiring new technologies. The system is
surprisingly effective at speeding along what would otherwise be an unplayable
behemoth of a game.

Interleaved vs. Sequential Phases

Description
This describes two different meta-turn structures. In an Interleaved Phase
structure (a), all players perform the first phase, then all perform the second
phase, etc. In a Sequential Phase structure (b), each player performs all phases
before moving on to the next player, who then performs all phases, etc.

Discussion
Interleaved structures in general are preferred in modern design, as they
re­duce downtime between player actions. War games in the 70s and 80s were
notorious for their “I Go, You Go” structures, where one player would take
a turn that could last for a very long time, with the other player wandering
off to do some other activity. In the 80s and 90s this started to shift, with
designers moving to Interleaved turn structures to keep players more engaged
throughout.
However, there are plenty of games that stick to a Sequential turn structure
for a variety of reasons. The Russian Campaign, a simulation of the German
invasion of Russia during World War II, uses a strictly Sequential turn structure.
Each player performs all of these steps before the turn passes to the next player:
•
•
•
•
•

Receive Reinforcements and Replacements
Move All Units
Combat
Breakthrough Movement

Turn Order and Structure

The Sequential structure of The Russian Campaign is integral to the strategy
and experience of the game. Allowing one player to move and attack twice
before the opponent gets to do anything gives the game epic swings and
devastating breakthroughs and does a particularly good job of capturing the
early and late phases of the war, which featured large-scale encirclements and
desperate breakouts.
In contrast, Power Grid uses an Interleaved turn structure. There are three
main Phases in each Round:
• Buy Power Plants
• Buy Raw Materials
• Build Power Lines
In turn, all players perform Buy Power Plants, then in turn all players perform
Raw Materials, etc. There is little time between a player taking their next action.
Any turn structure can be used inside the meta-structures of Sequential and
Interleaved. For example, Power Grid uses a Stat Order structure (TRN-02).
These structures aren’t mutually exclusive: some parts of a game may be
interleaved, and some may be sequential, and different Turn Order structures
may be used for each. For example, Simultaneous Turn structure is frequently
appropriate during upkeep or planning phases even though movement may
be sequential. As always, these different mechanisms are tools, and each has
its place and circumstance.

Lose a Turn

Description
This is a meta-mechanism that can be applied to a variety of turn structures.
A player who “Loses a Turn” must skip their next opportunity for a turn, and
will go to the next round, or the next time their turn arises.

Discussion
Losing a Turn was common in Roll and Move games of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries (MOV-02). In current game design philosophy, it
is considered an anti-pattern to be avoided, as it was frequently used as a
possible outcome of landing on a particular space or drawing a card—which
were, themselves, random. Losing a Turn keeps the player from enjoying
and participating in the game, and can be very frustrating if one player is
disproportionately affected. Mostly though, it frustrates the intent of the
player as a person seeking to engage in an activity. Players want to play a
game, and losing your turn means not playing a game. Like the ads on the
radio that interrupt the music, if it happens too often, players will “change
stations” and play something else.
There are other mechanisms where players are allowed to take a turn,
but may end up not doing anything, which can be equally an issue, that are
functionally (and psychologically) generally equivalent to Lose a Turn. An
example may be having to win a Roll and Move game by “exact count,” such
as Trouble or Snakes & Ladders. In these games, players may only win by
advancing to the final space by getting exactly what they need, and can result
in many turns of fruitlessly rolling a die and spinning a spinner. While the
players are still getting a turn, and there is some excitement in seeing if the
player will win, it still can become frustrating if it lasts many turns.

Similarly, games like Sorry! require certain values to leave “Home” and, in
essence, start the game. Again, this can result in many consecutive turns of
inactivity, which leads to frustration and boredom. Monopoly can send players
to Jail, where they will need to roll doubles to escape. Monopoly has some
remediation to this “Lose a Turn” effect, as players may choose to pay to get
out of Jail, or, in later stages of the game, may prefer (and hope) to remain in
Jail to avoid the possibility of paying high rents.
There are other effects that are similar to losing a turn. In a Worker
Placement game (Chapter 9), losing a worker for a round is equivalent to losing
a turn. In an Action Retrieval system (ACT-03), the turn that the Actions
are retrieved can feel like a lost turn to players. In a card game where you are
trying to discard all your cards by playing one per turn (like UNO), having to
draw cards is similar to “Losing a Turn” in terms of tempo, although it does
not impinge on the player’s participation in the game. Similarly, when some
players gain extra turns, this is equivalent to the others losing a turn. However,
due to psychological framing effects, these more modern takes do not feel as
bad. Thus, giving extra turns to other players or removing resources can be a
better solution for including “Lose a Turn” effects.
If the reason that a turn is lost is in control of the player, then this antipattern is mediated. If players choose to take a risky course or over-spend
a resource that leaves them unable to take a turn, that can be an effective
design, as it is resulting from player action, and is not perceived the same
psychologically by players. As an example, in the Passed Action Token
game, Camelot (TRN-14), players who play too slowly may miss a turn if the
other Action Token catches up to them. Instead of making a game slow and
frustrating, this adds excitement, as players can see the Action Token getting
closer, and players have the ability to play faster to avoid losing a turn.

Interrupts

Description
This is a meta-mechanism for Turn Order. Players may take an action that
interrupts the normal turn flow.

Discussion
This mechanism can be used with almost any of the turn structures discussed.
The ability to interrupt an opponent during their turn can be an important
part of the design. The interruption can be a standard ability that players have
and can be based on cards in their hands or other special tokens.
Squad Leader is an example of the “standard ability” style. During the
Movement Phase, one player moves their pieces or stacks one-by-one, one space
at a time. The other player (the “defender” for that turn) may, at any time,
interrupt movement to take a Defensive Fire opportunity at the moving units.
This is an option that is always available to units; no special ability is required.
Magic: The Gathering, in contrast, features some cards that are labelled as
Instants. These cards can be played in response to the opponent taking an
action. Other games frequently will call these cards Reactions. If you don’t
have a Reaction card, you will not be able to take a Reaction.
Incorporating Interrupts into the design has a number of positive features.
First, it keeps players engaged. If you can interrupt what your opponent is
doing, you can look for the perfect opportunity to strike, and it encourages
players to pay attention to what’s going on. This reduces downtime, or
perceived downtime. Before Squad Leader, war games mostly had a strict “I
Go, You Go” structure, which made it appealing for players to mentally check
out when it was not their turn.
In Squad Leader, even if defenders never take a Defensive Fire shot, they
feel like it was their turn as well, in a way because they were always evaluating
the option. Similarly, in games where you can play Reaction cards, players
need to monitor the action continuously.

Turn Order and Structure

Interrupts add uncertainty and chaos to the game and undermine the
ability of players to create a perfect plan. You cannot be certain that the squad
will make it across the street, or that the monster will successfully attack. This
can be positive or negative depending on the goal of the design.
It also gives a leg up to players who are more familiar with the game than
new players. Understanding the range of possible opponent responses gives
experienced players an advantage when formulating their plans. Even if they
can’t be perfect, they can plan contingencies for possible opponent responses.
Because of their asynchronous nature, Interrupts require rules and
conventions around their play, to give players the opportunity to react, and
also to adjudicate if multiple players want to react at the same time.
In Squad Leader, for example, there is a specific rule that a player moving a
stack of units must pause briefly after each space is entered to give an opponent
the opportunity to announce Defensive Fire. This requires cooperation of the
players to keep these pauses long enough for players to decide, but short enough
not to unduly lengthen the game. Conventions may be developed, such as a
player being allowed to request a few extra seconds to make a decision.
Similarly, when playing reaction cards, there needs to be an opportunity
for players to play them.
Some designs allow Interrupts to themselves be interrupted. Obviously,
the system needs to prevent infinite Interrupts, typically by playing a card
to execute them. There also needs to be a system to handle these multiples.
Magic: The Gathering uses a LIFO system, using an Instant stack. If a player
wants to play an Instant in response to another Instant, it is played on top of the
earlier card. When all Instants have been played into this stack, they are resolved
from the top down. So the first card to be played will be the last to be resolved.
Some games will actually allow the Interrupt to change the turn order. For
example, in Mille Bornes, a player may respond to a Hazard card being played
on them by playing the matching Safety. If they do, the interrupting player
immediately becomes the active player, and takes a normal turn. The players
between the old active player and interrupting player are skipped, losing their
turn (TRN-16).

Actions

ӶӶ
When watching a movie, or seeing a play, the story progresses independent
of the viewer. Games, however, require action by the player to move things
forward. These actions may be based purely on luck, rely solely on the player’s
skill, or lie somewhere in between. But a fundamental differentiator of games
from many other activities is that the players must act.
While later chapters will discuss what those specific actions might be, this
one describes different ways that the players are permitted by the designer to
take actions, and the way that those flow. Thus, the mechanisms discussed
here should be viewed in conjunction with the Turn Structures of Chapter 2.
An Action is an atomic step or series of steps that a player chooses to
perform. For example, moving a piece, picking up a cube, selling a share
of stock, or initiating combat may all be Actions. An Action may also be
compound, allowing a player to both pick up a cube and sell a share of stock,
depending on the structure and metaphor of the game.
The selection and integration of Actions into the game can give play a
specific feel. These Action systems control the complexity of the game, in
terms of the number of Actions a player may perform consecutively and
how they interrelate, the interaction between players, and other features.
Manipulation of the Action system, like in a Rondel (ACT-10, Rondel
Games) or Action Queue (ACT-06), can become the focus of the game itself
and a key mechanism. Or it can simply provide a framework that fades into
the background.
If a game is not interactive enough or is overwhelming players with too
many choices, the root of the problem is frequently in the way Actions are
made available to the players. Looking closer at that part of the design may
pay dividends.

Action Points

Description
A player receives a number of Action Points on their turn. They may spend
them on a variety of Actions.

Discussion
This is a very general mechanism that is isomorphic to a variety of game
structures. However, some generalities can be discussed.
A common implementation of this mechanism is that a player receives
a fixed number of Action Points on their turn, and can spend them on any
combination of Actions, each of which spends one of those points. Pandemic,
for example, gives a player four Action Points each turn, which can be spent
by on several Actions like moving to another city or removing a disease cube.
Tikal takes a similar approach, but Actions may cost more than one Action
Point. Each player gets 10 Action Points for the turn, and the cost of Actions
ranges from 1 to 4. This can dramatically increase the decision space for
players, so the designer needs to be cognizant of the additional weight this
will add to the game.
A game may have multiple currencies of Action Points. Through the Ages: A
Story of Civilization has two types of Action Points: Civil and Military. Each
may only be spent on specific types of Actions.
Variations of this mechanism may also limit players to only performing
an Action one time per turn. Some allow players to leave some Action Points

Actions

73

unused to be carried over to the next turn, and others require that all be spent
or lost.
Many games use this mechanism without explicitly awarding Action
Points to the players. For example, the game may simply tell players that
they may do two out of three possible Actions, or even one. In Feudum, each
player simultaneously selects four out of eleven Action cards available in a
personal pool to use each turn. This makes it obvious whether an Action can
be performed multiple times, or just once, depending on many copies of the
same Action card are in the deck.
A variant of an Action Point system is found in Starship Samurai. Here,
players select the Action they wish to perform from a limited menu. They
must also use one of their order counters, which are numbered from 1 to 4.
The number determines the number of times the Action may be executed.
For example, if players choose the Move Action and use their “3” token, they
get to move 3 units.
Action Point systems give the players a lot of flexibility in how they
approach their turn. The pace of the game can be controlled by the designer
by changing the number of Action Points available each turn. Small values
will lead to quicker turns. Larger values will lengthen turns, but also open
up more space for combos.

Action Drafting

Description
Players select from an assortment of Actions in a shared pool. The available
Actions are limited in quantity, and once a player has chosen an Action it may
not be chosen again.

Discussion
This mechanism creates player interaction within the Action selection itself.
While many games have Actions, typically if an Action is chosen by one
player, that does not deny it to another. Action Drafting creates a marketplace
for Actions, with players competing to select them.
Action Drafting is a very common mechanism that goes by a variety of names,
such as Role Selection or Worker Placement. In a Worker Placement mechanism,
players place pawns (“workers”) onto Action spaces on a board, performing that
Action and denying it to their opponents. Because of the variety and importance
of Worker Placement, we have dedicated Chapter 9 to exploring its considerations
and variations. The issues discussed there, such as the strength of the first player
advantage, apply to most of the mechanisms discussed here as well.
Citadels is an example of a Role Selection implementation of Action Drafting.
In Citadels, the start player takes all the role cards (which show their associated
actions), selects an Action card, and then passes the remaining cards to the player
to the left. Because the card chosen is secret, this system generates information
asymmetry (UNC-05). Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy are similar examples of
Role Selection, as in a round each player selects (drafts) a role and gets to perform

Actions

75

associated actions. Puerto Rico allows players to perform a less powerful version of
the action drafted by the player (see “Follow, ACT-08” in this chapter), while Race
for the Galaxy also has Follow but allows players to select the same role.
Another frequent implementation of this system uses a Dice Pool. At the start
of the Action Selection phase, a number of dice are rolled, and each number
corresponds to a specific action. In La Granja, for example, all the 4s rolled are
placed into the “Take 4 Coins” action space. Once all dice are placed in their
boxes, the players take turns selecting a die, and performing the associated
action. In a separate twist, there is an extra die left over after all players have
selected two action dice, and every player gets to perform that final action.
An Action Drafting system based on a dice pool works against perfect
plans, as players need to adapt to whatever is available. In addition, it forces
players to consider not just their own plans, but also what their opponents
may need. Players may consider taking a sub-optimal choice in order to
deprive it from their opponents (so-called “hate drafting”).
Another variant is found in Dungeon Lords. In this game, players secretly
select three out of six possible Action cards, placing them secretly face down
in front of them in order. Each player then reveals their first card, and places
tokens on the selected spaces (with ties in order being broken by a Start Player
token). The players who place earlier on each Action space can perform more
powerful versions of the Actions.
In War of the Ring, each player has their own dice pool, and players alternate
selecting one of their dice. These systems are not really drafting, in that
players are not denying their opponent an Action. However, it does restrict
the range of possible Actions, gives players flexibility, and an understanding
of the possible Actions available to their opponent.

Action Retrieval

Description
Each player has a set of Actions available to them, embodied in cards, tokens,
or some other affordance. Once performed, they are spent and may not be
performed again until retrieved. Action Retrieval typically is itself an Action,
or may take an entire turn.

Actions

77

Discussion
This mechanism focuses on efficiency. Because retrieving the used cards takes
an Action, players that retrieve more frequently will be at a disadvantage, as
they will conduct fewer Actions that advance their cause.
The Actions usually span a gamut of discrete options that affect different
aspects of the game. For example, Assault of the Giants has the actions: Move,
Attack, Recruit, Make Alliance, and Leader. Once players use Move, they
cannot play it again until they take a Retrieve turn, which restores all action
cards used since the last Retrieve. This stops players from selecting a specific
Action like Recruiting over and over again, and forces them to adopt balanced
strategies, and plan several turns ahead. Therefore, a game that adopts this
mechanism has a much more strategic feel. It also allows for additional
tactical play, as opponents will know, for example, that you do not have a
Move action available, and will not be able to respond to opponents moving
to different areas.
Many games introduce additional wrinkles to reward planning and
sequencing. Assault of the Giants, for example, makes Actions more powerful
the more Actions were previously played. For example, if the Move card is
played as the first card after a Retrieve, only one unit can move. But if Recruit
and Attack have been played before Move, then three units may move.
Another variation is a mix of one-time and recoverable cards. Gloomhaven
has some action cards that can only be used one time during a scenario.
Others may be recovered by having a character Rest.

Action/Event

Description
On their turn, the player plays a card that shows Action Points and an Event.
They must choose to either use the Action Points or perform the Event. If
They choose to use Action Points, typically the Event may be performed by
another player.

Discussion
This mechanism builds on a basic Action Point system, and allows designers
to integrate a lot of flavor and special actions to a system to emphasize theme.
It was pioneered in historical simulations as a way of introducing historical
events without unduly adding rules overhead. For example, Twilight Struggle,
a simulation of the Cold War, has a card that can either be used for 3 Action
Points or the Warsaw Pact event. If the Action Points are chosen, there is a
standard list of Actions on which they can be spent (ACT-01).
Many games incorporate an Event Deck (ACT-17), which is another way
to include special effects and deeper theming. However, the Action/Event
system gives players another layer of choice, rather than simply imposing
global effects.
Often, games using this system add another layer of player decision-making
by having some or all events only eligible for specific players. For example, in

Actions

79

We The People, a simulation of the American Revolution, certain events may
only be performed by the Colonists, and others by Great Britain. If a player is
not eligible for the event on a card, they must use the Action Points. Similarly,
some events are dependent on specific locations, control of particular areas,
the presence of certain characters, etc. In Empires of the Void II, for example,
events can be tied to specific planets, and if those planets are not in play or
the player is unable to execute some condition related to that planet, the player
may only use the card for its point value, rather than the event. In World War
II: Barbarossa to Berlin there are prerequisite events that must be triggered
before other events may be used.
Twilight Struggle takes this even further, letting the opponent use an Event
if the card is played for the Action Points. For example, the Warsaw Pact event
can only be used by the USSR player. If the USA player plays the card, he or
she must use the 3 Action Points, and the USSR will perform the Event. This
makes choosing and sequencing card play very important.
Twilight Struggle and We the People are two-player games. This system
is extended to multiplayer in The Expanse Board Game, which supports up
to four players, each of whom represents a faction. Between two and four
factions are eligible for each event, and if a player uses the Action Points, the
other players are given the option to perform it, in a priority order.
