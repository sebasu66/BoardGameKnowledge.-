Nemesis (2018)—­If you like your games large, complicated, and mean-­spirited, then I
recommend this unauthorized take on the Aliens franchise. It manages to capture the
action and paranoia, especially of the movie Aliens, as the intruders evolve and stalk
you and one (or more) of your allies might not be your friend.
Heroclix (2002)/Horrorclix (2006)/Halo Actionclix (2007)/Star Trek Heroclix: Away Team
(2012)—­Fondly known by its fans as “nerd chess,” the Clix system uses a clever dial
system to track the health, powers, and stats of your characters as you fight on a grid-­
battlefield. The selection of characters is mind-­boggling, with fantastic sculpts. I recommend playing the basic game several times before diving into more complex
scenarios.
I’ve authored several thematic games myself including Rayguns and Rocketships (2017),
which is a skirmish-­style action miniatures game set in a 1930s pulp sci-­fi universe;
ALIEN: Fate of the Nostromo (2020), a cooperative survival game based on the classic
1979 sci-­fi thriller; and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the Game (2023), a cooperative horror game based on the 1974 horror movie where you must reach in the “hideous draw
bag” to retrieve tokens that help and hinder your escape from Leatherface! I’m proud
of all three of these designs!

There are so many amazing thematic games, I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface talking about them. It’s what I love about thematic games: anything can be turned into a game
and there’s something for everyone! What’s your favorite thematic game?
My favorite is: _____________________________________________________

Thematic games are all about drama!
Ameritrash doesn’t mean what you think it does.
A board game can be about any theme.
Don’t violate the triangle of weirdness.
Let theme inspire your gameplay and mechanisms.
The feeling of danger is much more important than putting the player in danger.
Identify and reduce the complexity of your design.
In thematic games, fun is more important than balance.
Use a component of quality in your prototype to help you and your players get
in the mood.
Include rules for different players counts (solo, teams, etc.).
The best game designs invoke emotions. Use the right mechanisms to help
players experience them.

L e t ’s S e ll a B oard Game
YOU’VE DESIGNED SEVERAL board games, playtested them, revised them, and maybe
even created some artwork to make them look pretty. . .now what?
If you are just making a board game as a hobby, then congratulations! You don’t need to do
anything else. You’ve done it! You are a game designer! You have playable games that you can
share with your family and friends at any time! However, if you want to be a professional
game designer and earn money from your board games, then let’s talk about what it takes to
sell your game.

Why Sell Your Board Game?
When I started making board games, I did it because, frankly, I was bored. I lived in a house
that was way up a mountain, my friends were far away, and I was too young to drive. I had
played a lot of games, and possibly just like you, after playing many games, I started to think
I could make one too.
I enjoyed making the games. I like the craft element of making a prototype and seeing a game
design develop. I shared my games with family members (well, mostly my little brother).
When he enjoyed playing them, I got satisfaction, and that was enough.
After I designed Rayguns and Rocketships (2017), I created a game that I wanted to see exist.
My game already existed, per se, but I wanted it to be a real commercial product with artwork
and components better than I could make by myself. I wanted to share my game with the world.
I had a prototype, but I wasn’t sure how to get it published, nor did I know if anyone would
even be interested in it! At the time, I was already a member of the online gaming community and had friends who had published their own board games—­either by licensing their
game to a publisher or by publishing their game themselves. So, I asked them what they did.
Never be afraid to ask for help. Most people are happy to help you and want to see you succeed. Just like them, I want to see you succeed, so let me tell you what I learned.

First Things First
Before you pitch your prototype, there are several steps that you should take to prepare for
pitching your game. The first is to create a page for the game on BoardGameGeek.com.
On the top bar of the web page, select Community and click the carrot. On the drop-­down
menu, select Contribute and then select Board Game.
This will open the Create Board Game page where you are going to enter a lot of information
about your game including the title, the number of players, the time it takes to play, a description of the game, credits (which we will talk about in a moment), publisher information, and
year released. Here are all the fields that you should fill out, including a couple of tricky ones:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■
■■

■■

Title: This is the name of your game. Double-­check the BGG database and Google
search to make sure your name is unique.
Description: This is an overview of your game and the gameplay. Think of it as what
might be on the back of the game’s box. This description should be somewhat, but not
too, long and should go into some detail about how to play and win the game. If you
look at other examples of similar games on the website, you should get an idea of how
detailed you will need to be.
Short description: This is a newer feature on the site, and it can be tricky to write.
You want to grab the reader but describe the gameplay at the same time. These are a
few examples I’ve written:
■■ “Planeteers battle for control of the galaxy in this pulp sci-­fi action game!”
■■ “Guess the identity of characters created with colorful cards and clever clues.”
■■ “A cooperative superhero worker placement game that can be played on any
comic book.”
Year released: Since your game isn’t out yet, you can just estimate the year that it
will be released. You can always change it later.
Number of players: This is one of the three essentials and should be pretty obvious!
Minimum age: This is one of the three essentials. If you want to determine the minimum age of your player, there are four axioms: reading, math, maturity, and complexity. Kids 8 and under might not have learned how to read bigger words.1 Children
under 5 might not be able to perform basic math. If your game has mature themes
such as violence, substance use, or sex, then it might not be appropriate for players 17
and under. Some games are just too complex for younger players. Playtesting will help
you gauge this age range.
Minimum playtime: This is one of the three essentials. It is extremely important to
get this correct. If your listed playtime is incorrect, gamers might get angry as they feel
like they have been misled in some way. There are a few factors that we, as game designers, need to keep in mind when calculating playing time.

Yes, yes. I know that your kids are smarter than average kids.

L e t ’ s S e ll a B oa r d G am e

First, consider the time it takes a first-­time player to learn the game. Just reading the
rule book alone—­depending on how complicated the game is—­might add anywhere
from another 25 minutes to hours (!) to the playing time. Then add to that the time
taken to make sure that you are playing the game correctly. As a rule, I assume that I
will always get at least one rule wrong the first two times I play a new game. This is why
I try to play any game at least three times so that way I feel like I am playing it correctly!
Another factor that extends playtime is analysis paralysis that can be generated
from having a game be too complex or giving too many meaningful choices to the
player. While I’ve said that giving players a choice is one of the best things you can do
in your game design, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing!
Category: This is what we’ve been calling genre. BGG lumps both game genre and
story genre under this listing.
Mechanisms: You should know the mechanisms of your game, but if you have some
doubts, I recommend looking at similar playing games and seeing what mechanisms
they’ve listed. Also read the description of the mechanism. If yours is a match,
then use it!
People: This is the trickiest entry because it’s like what they say about getting a job as
a cashier: You need cashier experience to get the job. If you’ve already made a game
that’s listed on BGG, then great, just select your name and you’re good to go! My name
on BGG is Scott Rogers (II).
If you aren’t listed on the site yet, you have one more step before you can submit your
game. On the top bar of the web page, select Community and click the carrot. On the
drop-­down menu, select Contribute and then select Person. You will be taken to the
Create Person page. Fill it out and at the bottom, under Note to Admin, explain that
you are creating this listing as a designer credit for your game. You might have to wait
a few days for the person to be approved before you can go back and create the board
game listing.
Why does this matter? Because credits are very important. (I have more to say on this.)
Publisher: You can select unknown or looking for a publisher for now.
Year released: You can tick the No Year Available square for now.
Dimensions: Check N/A.
Languages: Select any languages that your rules are written in.

So, why would you want to create a page on BGG even before the game is published? There
are a few good reasons to do so. It establishes your game with an associated date. This will
help dissuade others from naming their game the same as yours in the future. Since you will
have a description of the game on the page, others can quickly learn what your game is about.
You can post images of your prototype and your sell-­sheet (be sure to mark them “creative”
since they aren’t of the final game) as well as post any how-­to-­play videos. Your page becomes
a location where you can send potential customers, fans, and publishers to learn about your
game. Don’t forget to subscribe to the page so you will get alerts when someone reacts or
responds on the page.

If you’d rather create your own website for your game or if you already own a web page or a
blog, you can post all the previous information there instead. Giving your game a landing
page—­which is an exciting looking page that showcases your game—­is a great way to get
people excited about your game. You can even invest in a QR code (there are several QR code
generators that are available online) that you can print onto a business card that will lead to
your website or landing page. A QR code is a quick and simple way to promote your game to
potential customers that you meet at a convention or other gaming events.

The Importance of Sell-­Sheets
Websites are fine, but the best way to promote your board game to a publisher is with a sell-­
sheet. Figure 10.1 gives an example of a sell-­sheet for the Hungry Spiders game.
Sell-­sheets are a promotional tool for your board game—­a game’s résumé as it were—­that
describes what’s cool about your game. It also provides vital information to a potential publisher, which helps them determine the game’s genre, playtime, player age, and even how
much it might cost to produce the game.
A sell-­sheet is a “leave-­behind” the designer can give to publishers at conventions or to send
to them via email. They are also often used as the first stage of entry in many tabletop design
contests. You can find examples of sell-­sheets in Appendix B, but you’ll notice that all these
sell-­sheets have many elements in common. Let’s look at what your sell-­sheet needs:
■■

■■

■■

Your game’s logo: While every game needs a great title, that title also must have a
great logo. The easiest way to create a logo is to go to a website like 1001fonts.com
or Dafont.com. You want to pick a font that matches the theme of your game. If
your game is playful, then find a “fun” font. If your game is scary, then pick a “horror-­
themed” font. If your game is “science fiction themed,” then pick a sci-­fi font. You can
also hand-­draw your logo if you need something unique and you possess some artistic
talent. Logos go far to give a game an identity and communicate the game’s genre.
The “three essentials”: The Number of Players, Minimum Age of Players, and Time It
Takes to Play Your Game are critical to have on your sell-­sheet. These provide key things
about your game the publisher will use to determine whether they will want to publish
the game. For example, some publishers won’t make games for two players, while others specialize in them. If your game supports solo play, then it is for one to four (or
whatever) players.
Gameplay overview: This is a brief overview of how to play the game and how to win
the game. Keep this as brief as possible, no more than a sentence. If you can’t describe
your gameplay in a sentence or two, you might have a problem. Here’s an example of a
brief overview of a game from one of my own sell-­sheets:

This is based on a true story: For 16 years, the town of Kringa has been terrorized by an evil
Strigoi named Jure Grando. While your family struggles to survive day to day, you must gather and
build the tools, weapons, and courage to defeat the undead fiend!
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Notice the elements that I highlight in this overview—­where the game takes place
(Kringa), who the threat is (an evil Strigoi), what the player is doing (survive day to day,
gather, and build tools, weapons, and courage), and how to win (defeat the undead fiend). If
you can communicate that many elements in your overview, you’re on the right track!
Game photos: Show at least one photo of the game in action, preferably with the
game set up to show what it looks like to play. You don’t always need to show players
playing the game in your photos, but if you do, make sure they look like they are having a good time. Fake the shot if you must. Nobody wants to buy a game if its players
don’t look like they are enjoying themselves.
When taking photos or videos of your prototype, you want to make your prototype
look as professional as you can. While some designers feel like this is a waste of money
and time, I believe that first impressions count. If your game looks “done,” then publishers are often more likely to want to publish it. This may mean spending some time
and money to create and print professional-­looking cards or components.
Gameplay description: Describe the action that is going on in the photos. Tell the
reader how the game is played, what’s cool and unique about the game play, and why
they would want to make it. Use short sentences or bullet points to get this across.
Once again, beware of the blocks of text. I also think that “beautiful art” and “great
story” are not valid bullet points. All games should have these (unless they are an
abstract game).
Components list: Include a list of all the components that come within the game.
This is actually very important because they let the publisher know just how much
your game will cost to make. If you have dozens of dice or miniatures in your game,
then some publishers might think twice or reject your game completely based on that.
Others might welcome it. Knowing who you are pitching your game to is an important
part of the selling process.
Your contact information: You should always include your name, email address,
and/or phone number on a sell-­sheet. Otherwise, how will the publisher be able to
contact you when they are ready to buy your game? I also put my studio’s logo (Bedbug
Games) on the sell-­sheet. It gives me a little bit of a “brand identity” and makes me feel
a little more professional.
Graphics: Finally, make your sell-­sheet look nice. You don’t necessarily need pictures
on your sell-­sheet, but if you are trying to create a mood or a theme, drawings, fonts,
and graphics can go far. Even immediately, you can tell that A Town Called Showdown is
a Western-­themed game while Rayguns and Rocketships is a pulp sci-­fi game all because
of the color, graphics, and fonts I used on the sell-­sheet.

CHAPTER 10

357

L e t ’ s S e ll a B oa r d G am e

When using fonts, don’t forget about the two-­font rule of graphic design. This is the rule that
you should never use more than two styles of fonts on your documents: a “fancy” or thematic
one for logos, titles, and headers and a simple font for body text. I am a big fan of using
simple, legible fonts like Calibri, Cambria, and Helvetica Neue as body text.

The Pitch Presentation
If a sell-­sheet can’t convey everything that you want or if the publisher asks for more elaboration on the game design you pitch, then I recommend you create a pitch presentation. These
are created in programs like PowerPoint and Slides.
The format of a pitch presentation is longer and more elaborate than a sell-­sheet and requires
much more information. A good format for a pitch presentation would include the following slides:
Slide 1: The first slide (shown in Figure 10.2) should contain the title logo and an evocative
image. Think of this as the poster of a movie or the start screen of a video game.

Figure 10.2 The title slide

Slide 2: The second slide (see Figure 10.3) is usually a recap of the sell-­sheet including most of
the information from it including the game outline, three essentials, etc. You can leave off
the components list, but do consider including a short list of mechanisms found in the game.

NOTE

Figure 10.3 The game overview slide

Slide 3: The third slide (see Figure 10.4) can start to detail the gameplay. These presentations
are meant to replicate what it is like to play the game, so start with who the player is playing,
what they are doing, and why they are doing it. If you don’t have time to draw illustrations
or build and playtest a prototype, then you might want to consider creating a mock-­up
using other game components. Photograph this mock-­up in various gameplay states to
show what it looks like to play your game.
A mock-­up isn’t a playable prototype, and it isn’t a finished game, but it looks like one.
It’s merely a way to show the publisher what you are intending to design. Be very clear to
them that the game hasn’t been designed yet; rather, this is something that you have in
mind when describing the game. Think of it as concept art for your game design. The irony
is that in some cases, publishers have asked me to send them the mock-­up to play—­a game
that I haven’t even built yet!
Slide 4–9: The next few slides (see Figure 10.5 through Figure 10.10) should highlight gameplay features, systems, and components. Try to illustrate the gameplay as clearly as possible.
You might need to use multiple images to illustrate the idea. For example, if a player has to
draw a token from a bag, show a picture of the player’s hand going into the bag and then
another of the player drawing out the token. The goal is to make the gameplay clear for the
publisher. The last thing you want is for them to be confused about how your game plays.

When making a game pitch, publishers often want to know if you have any expansions
planned. The answer should always be yes! You always want to extend the life of your game.
Never design a game to be “one and done”—­the real money is in the extended life of your
board game—­whether it is reprinted, translated, thematic reskins, made into a second
edition, or adding expansions.
Slide 11: I usually finish these presentations with an “any questions” slide (see Figure 10.12).
You don’t need to have this, but it is good to include it just in case you need to present your
presentation online or in person. Overall, just like with sell-­sheets, the content of these
slides should be concise and to the point.

Figure 10.12 Wrap-­up slide

The Pitch Video
Pitch videos (or how-­to-­play videos) are starting to supplement or even replace sell-­sheets.
I know of some publishers that won’t accept a game submission without one. While a pitch
video is the clearest way you can show off your game, it requires a lot of work to create.
Making a video can seem somewhat daunting, but it doesn’t need to be anything more complex than you playing a sample turn or a round of your game, narrating what you are doing
and telling the viewer why it is fun and unique.

Describing how to play a game is like telling a story. Start with the premise of who the player
is and how they can win. Then show what the player controls (a hand of cards, some dice, a
mini with stats, or whatever basic action your game requires) and go from there. Show how
the player interacts with the “world” of the game until they reach the goal.
If you are going to hold your phone/camera, keep it as steady as possible. It might be worthwhile to invest in a stand or even a few LED lights. Figure 10.13 shows a basic setup for
shooting a how-­to-­play video.

Figure 10.13 Camera setup

Your goal is to create a video that is two to three minutes long (or less) that adequately shows
and tells the viewer how to play your game. Here’s what you will need to shoot a pitch video:
■■

■■

A physical copy of your prototype: You’ve already made six different games
throughout this book, so this shouldn’t be an issue, right? Try to make your prototype
look as nice as it can be. Don’t use cards with scratched-­out rules or text, try to use
components of quality, make sure your game board lies relatively flat, etc. Essentially,
present to the publisher what you would present during a demo or pitch at a convention.
A camera: The camera in your mobile device should work fine, but I recommend
shooting using a horizontal orientation rather than a vertical one, as it will show more

CHAPTER 10

■■

■■

L e t ’ s S e ll a B oa r d G am e

of the game and the play area. You might consider using a tripod or some other mount
to keep the camera steady. I recommend keeping the camera on the game for the entire
video. You don’t need to be in it. Your voice is enough. Shoot from a top-­down view
whenever possible. If you must move the camera, do it slowly and in short increments.
If you need a beauty shot of a miniature or some other component, be mindful of your
distance. Too close and the image will be too blurry. Too far and components will be
hard to see and read. Just like when shooting a selfie, be aware of what’s in your environment. You don’t want to show something embarrassing in the background.
Lighting: Adequately light your play environment. Be mindful of the glare on sleeved
cards or laminated boards. You can reduce this by lighting from the side rather than
straight on or by using a second light. Also, this will help reduce shadows. Try not to
cover up the game with your shadow.
A neutral surface: Avoid using anything shiny like glass, metal, or a clear plastic
table cover when shooting your video. I recommend placing a tablecloth to display a
game. Avoid “hot” colors like red or yellow. But depending on your components, they
might be hard to see against dark colors too. You can’t go wrong with a white tablecloth
(as long as it is clean). Avoid using a tablecloth with a busy pattern.
A script: Writing a script is especially helpful if you aren’t comfortable with speaking
in public or have poor improv skills. Memorize it (or at least be familiar with it) so that
way you don’t stumble over tricky words or phrases. Speak as clearly and loudly as possible. Don’t mumble. Take your time to speak, but don’t take too long. A trick I’ve
learned is to spell complicated words out phonetically in your script; it’s easier to read
them that way. It’s okay to read from a script since you won’t be in the shot anyway. If
you aren’t good at speaking, you can have a friend or family member read the
script for you.
Within your script, if your game is complicated, just focus on the main gameplay. Don’t
worry about lore, detailed mechanisms, systems, or expansions.
A quiet location: Try to get your environment as quiet as possible to capture the best
sound. Put the kids, pets, and any noisy family members into another room, and turn
off any loud fan, TV set, and alarm on your mobile phone. You don’t want anything to
interrupt you while you are recording.
Edit. . .if you must: I’ve seen varying quality of pitch videos—­and the simple ones
are just as effective as the fancy ones. Some creators feel compelled to edit their footage. This really isn’t necessary. You are selling your game, not your video-­editing skills.

When you are done, make sure that your video is in MP4 format. This is the most common
media player format. If your video is too large to send via email, you can always upload it to
a cloud drive (Google Drive, Dropbox) and send the recipient the link. I’ve even posted a
how-­to-­play video on YouTube or Vimeo. The advantage to doing this is that you can then
share it on BGG’s video section.

NOTE

The Digital Solution
During the global pandemic, game designers faced a big problem. How are we supposed to
playtest our game when we can’t interact with other people? Fortunately, Tabletop Simulator
(TTS) was there to help! This “game” developed by Berserk Games is available on STEAM,2
and it allows gamers to play board games in a virtual environment. While it’s not my favorite
way to play a board game, it works fine when you can’t leave the house.
Where TTS excels is as a prototyping tool. You can rapidly prototype a game design and have
it up and running in as quickly as an hour or so. However, the software’s controls and commands do take some getting used to. Fortunately, I’ve gotten pretty good at using TTS. Here
are a few pointers:
■■

TTS is best for games that use standard components. While TTS does have the ability
to import custom miniatures and create custom components (like dice with custom
faces or tiles with die-­cut shapes) it’s a lot easier to start with out-­of-­the-­box components such as cards, dice, tokens, and tiles.
Items like game boards and player mats can be locked down so they don’t move during
play. To lock down a component, select the component, and right-­click it. Select the
Toggle menu and select the check mark next to Lock. Don’t forget to unlock it if you
need to move it around!
Create your card faces (front and back) digitally3 first before you start creating your
game in TTS. Going back and forth between programs while setting up your game in
TTS is a waste of time.
Make custom tokens “stackable” when they are created in the custom component controls.
Every rule book needs illustrations. Set up your game in TTS, move the camera around
to look at the components, and then use your computer’s screenshot tool (Ctrl+PrtScn
on PC/Shift+Command+4 on Mac) to capture an image. You might want to trim the
image in a graphics program like WinPaint or Photoshop, and then you can import the
image file (generally with an extension of .jpg) into your rules document. This is
especially good for showing the game setup for play or for processes such as taking a
particularly complex action.

There are many other things that TTS is good for. I have pitched games to publishers in TTS.
Why read a sell-­sheet or watch a video when you can play the game? I have used it for playtesting sessions with out-­of-­town or international friends. Sometimes, I just push pieces
around on the table while I’m brainstorming a new game design.
While it will never replace real physical board games, TTS is a good tool, and a smart game
designer should never turn their back on using a good tool.

Playtesting Events
One of the best ways to network is to attend a playtesting event. They go by many names
such as ProtoSpiel, UnPub, or FirstToPlay, but they all offer the same thing: an opportunity
for game designers to get their prototypes rigorously playtested. These events are a great way
to meet other game designers and even publishers.
Playtesting events often require the game designer to pay a fee to “pay for the table” during
the event, but admission for playtesters is usually free. I have attended many playtesting
events and have a couple of tricks that you might find helpful.
■■

■■

■■

■■

Bring a tablecloth: A tablecloth in a single color such as black, blue, or red makes
the table more attractive, provides a good backdrop for your game on the table, and is
easier for you and others to spot particularly in a crowded room full of other game
designers!
Create a poster: These events have dozens of designers, all competing for playtester’s attention. Before the show, I will create a poster (similar to a movie poster) to
advertise my game. Then I will buy an acrylic sign holder (you can find these at office-­
supply stores and online) to display on my table. You will want to put the title of your
game, an evocative image, a short description of the game, and the three essentials
(number of players, playtime, and age) so that way playtesters quickly judge if they
want to play your game or not.
Bring snacks: Bring snacks not just for yourself (because playtesting events are long
days) but for your playtesters. Put out a bowl of candy or some other prewrapped treat.
Players are more encouraged to play if they are also getting a little treat!
Have an elevator pitch: You want to get a playtester excited right away. An elevator
pitch is a short description of your game. It should be short, no longer than a sentence
or two. I find it helps to use clever, evocative, or dramatic language. I also like to use
alliteration (words that start with the same letter) because it helps me remember my
elevator pitch. For example, my pitch for Who’s Hue (the game that became Pantone the
Game) was “A party game in which you create classic characters using colorful cards and clever clues!”

Your pitch should answer the following questions (which differs depending on the
genre of the game):
■■ What genre is the game play? (Card game, miniatures game, dice game, etc.)
■■ What theme is the game? (Horror, fantasy, abstract, etc.)
■■ What is the player doing? (i.e., gameplay)
■■ Who is the player? (Are they themselves such as in a party game, or are they a
character?)
The shorter and more intriguing your pitch is, the more likely it will capture the imagination of the audience.

The elevator pitch for my game is:

Selecting a Publisher
So, you’ve got your prototype, you’ve made your sell-­sheet, and you’ve shot your how-­to-­play
video. You might even have a digital version of your game on TTS. You’re looking pretty
good! Now, you need to find a publisher!
The thing to keep in mind when looking for a publisher is that you need the right publisher,
not just any publisher. You want to research which publishers make what types of games.
Some publishers might specialize in games with miniatures; others don’t want to make
games with miniatures. Other publishers publish only card games or only Euro-­style games
or only horror-­themed games.
There are several ways to find a publisher. You could go onto BoardGameGeek.com, go
into their advanced search tool, and under “publisher” enter in a letter of the alphabet and
look at all the publishers listed. This would be the worst solution as it could take forever!
(Don’t do this.)
You could do what I did when I was looking for a publisher for Rayguns and Rocketships.
I went to my friendly neighborhood game store, looked at every game on the shelf that had
miniatures in it, wrote down the names of those publishers in my sketchbook, went home,
looked up the websites of all those publishers, and emailed them with meeting requests for
the next convention I was going to. It’s not a bad method, but it is time-­consuming. At least
you get to visit a game store!
A better way is to search online for the phrase board game publisher, look at the results, and go
to their website. On their website, you will often find a “submissions” page. Here you will find
what they are looking to publish and, more importantly, what they don’t want to publish.

CHAPTER 10

L e t ’ s S e ll a B oa r d G am e

I don’t know about you, but I prefer a sure bet, or as close to a sure bet as I can get. If I can
find out exactly what a publisher is looking for, I can make that game for them, and they will
be much more interested in publishing that game. I find writing them an email is a great way
to make first contact with a publisher. Send them a brief but polite message along the lines of
the following:

Dear Publisher,
I am a game designer with an exciting new game design called [game name here]. I will be
attending [name of convention], and if you have a few minutes, I would love to show [game name
here] to you. Please contact me so we can coordinate our schedules. I look forward to hearing
from you soon.
Sincerely,
Your name here
You can also include your sell-­sheet in your email message to get them excited about the
game you are pitching.
While I recommend contacting them before the show, I find that the best way to meet a publisher is by attending a gaming convention. Cold calls are risky as often the publisher is too
busy or booked up to take an unscheduled meeting. However, it’s good at least to introduce
yourself to a business development (“biz dev”) manager or whomever is in charge of talking
to game designers. Sometimes, I will politely ask if they will have time to hear a pitch. If they
do, then great, it’s off to the races!
If you already have scheduled pitch meetings at a convention, make sure to give yourself time
to get from one meeting to another; you’ll need 15 to 30 minutes depending on the size of
the show! However, keep in mind that conventions are usually very busy for publishers, and
they might not have time to meet with you right then or even at all. If they decline, give them
your business card, and ask them if it is okay for you to reach out to them after the show.
There are many gaming conventions held around the world, but if you are looking to talk to a
publisher about selling a game design, I recommend attending at least one of these shows:
■■
■■
■■

GAMA (Game Manufacturers Association)—­Reno, Nevada (held in the spring)
Tokyo Game Market—­Tokyo, Japan (usually held in spring)
Origins Game Fair—­Columbus, Ohio (held in late spring)
Gen Con—­Indianapolis, Illinois (held in mid-­summer)

The Spiel—­Essen, German (held in the fall)
Board Game Geek Con—­Fort Worth, Texas (held in late fall)
PAX Unplugged—­Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (held in the winter)

These are just the biggest shows. There are other gaming conventions happening all the time;
just look online. I also recommend attending some of the larger comic book and anime conventions around the world (such as San Diego Comic Con, DragonCon, Anime LA, just to
name a few), as often board game publishers will attend those events too. If you don’t live
close to those bigger cons, you might want to go to a medium-­sized one. Any convention is
an opportunity to network with a publisher and fellow game designers.

Meeting with Publishers
Once you’ve contacted a publisher and you schedule a pitch meeting at a convention or
online, then what’s next? The following list contains my advice when pitching:
■■

■■

■■

■■

Pitching in person is best: Always present your game to a publisher in person. Your
enthusiasm for the game goes a long way in getting people excited about it.
Keep it short: You usually only have 15 to 30 minutes (or less!) to pitch, so practice
your pitch and keep it lean and tight!
Tell a story, not instructions: People love stories. It’s how we communicate with
each other. However, when it comes to teaching someone how to play a game, all too
often the designer will rattle off a list of instructions instead, which can be boring and
tedious. Even worse, your audience is trying to hold all this information in their head
about how to play the game, which can make understanding the game difficult, especially at a noisy and distracting place like a board game convention.
Instead, tell the “story of your game.” Include who the player is, why they are doing
what they are doing, how they are going to win, and how they can lose. State why the
publisher should care about the game. A good game has a flow and a logical order of
events. Use this to show them all the actions they can do while playing the game. Don’t
focus on the “backstory” or the lore of your game—­as much as you love your game’s
fiction, the publisher doesn’t care. They just want to know how the game is played.
Practice telling this “story" before you pitch. The better you get at telling the game’s
story, the more entertaining you can make it. Don’t be afraid to channel your inner
“ham.” Funny always helps. Just be careful not to overdo it. Also avoid using hyperbole
such as “this is the best game ever,” and never tear down other games to make your
own sound better. Don’t make statements like “my game is like Catan, but much better.” You never know, the designer of that game might be sitting right there with you!
Cheat (but just a little): If you get the time, you will want to demo your prototype.
A demo is a short example of the gameplay—­often no longer than a hand or a round or
two to show the publisher how the game is played.

CHAPTER 10

■■

L e t ’ s S e ll a B oa r d G am e

To give a great demo, you might have to “stack the deck” in your game’s favor…just a
little bit. You might want the most impressive combo in your game to “just happen”
during the demo, or you might want to show off a particularly funny or cool card from
the game. It’s okay to do this. You are not being dishonest; you are just showing your
game in the best possible light.
Practice what your “best game” might feel like and make sure that you are ready to
quickly set up and show your game. It’s always better to simulate a game “in progress”
than from the beginning. You will almost never get to play more than a round or two of
your game. The more complex your game is, the more likely you will have to be prepared to do this during your pitch. Also, practice putting the game away quickly so you
don’t lose or damage anything as you hurry to leave.
Read body language: There are many websites and books that can teach you how to
read body language. I won’t recount them here, but you must realize that a game pitch
is essentially a job interview for your game (and you!). Treat the pitch the same way:
arrive on time (or better, early), dress appropriately, and be polite.
During the pitch, if you are observant, you can tell whether you are doing well just by
seeing how others are reacting to you. In Figure 10.14, Ryan (the publisher on the left) is
smiling, leaning forward, and his “system” is open. He is interested in what I have to
say and maybe even the game I am pitching; John (on the right) is uncertain, leaning
back and has what is known as a “closed system” (arms crossed is a big “tell”), which
indicates he isn’t convinced with what I am showing him. I can try to get him to “open
up” by addressing John more or perhaps use him as a positive example about my game.
If I can get John to “open his system up” during the pitch, that’s a good sign that I am
headed in the right direction.

Bring a backup: I normally suggest that you pitch only one game at a time so that
you don’t overwhelm the publisher, but I’ve learned to bring other prototypes
“just in case.”
Let me share a story related to this. I was packing for a ProtoSpiel where I was running
demos for a couple of prototypes. I had a prototype for a small party game that I almost
didn’t bring with me because I didn’t want to “muddy the waters.” It is possible to bring
too many games with you to a show. I usually try to bring two: a “marquee” game that
I spend most of my time and effort promoting and a secondary game to pitch in case
there is an opportunity to do so. If you bring more than that, you end up carrying
around too many games, which can get very heavy!
Despite this, I ended up bringing the game with me. At the show, I ran into a publisher
who I had always wanted to work with. I asked if he had time to look at one of my
games, and he said he had only 15 minutes. I realized the only game that I had that was
short was the little party game. We played a few rounds. Long story short, he loved the
game, and we made a handshake deal on the spot to sign the game. While it didn’t get
published in the end, that’s okay. (It happens.)
The lesson is, if I hadn’t brought the game, I wouldn’t have signed it. If you aren’t sure,
bring it with you. You never know what might happen!
Leave a “takeaway”: A physical takeaway like a business card might seem old-­
fashioned, but publishers look at many games over the course of a convention. Without
these visual reminders of your game, they might forget about you after the show. If
you have a business card, make sure it includes detailed information to remind the
publisher who you are and what game is yours. I will usually make several cards, one
for each game that I am pitching at a show. The business card, along with your sell-­
sheet, helps keep you and your game connected with the publisher when they later sit
down and try to remember what the heck they saw at the show!
You might want to consider bringing extra copies of your game with the intention of
showing it to interested publishers. But beware, giving a prototype to a publisher is
no guarantee that it will be published. I am torn about leaving a prototype behind
with a publisher. I often can’t afford more than one or two copies of one of my games
(printing prototypes can get expensive), and leaving one with a publisher to evaluate
means I have one less copy to use for other pitches or for demos at a show.
Additionally, publishers usually don’t look at your prototype right away (they have
other shows to attend and their own projects to work on). I know some designers who
have waited months or longer for a publisher to get around to playing their prototype.
Most publishers I know have a big stack of these prototypes to play and only so much
time to do so. I find it much better to try to play the game (or at least a few rounds) in
person with the publisher so that way you know they have at least looked at it. I also
find that it is always better to play a game with the publisher—­your enthusiasm for
the game can help get them excited about the game. Pitching in person guarantees that
you have presented your game in the best possible light.

Make a friend first: Often, my goal isn’t to sell a game during a pitch, but just to
meet the publisher as a fellow person who likes games. Sometimes I even make a new
friend! The board game industry is built on relationships. If you are a decent person
(and a good designer), others will want to work with you. I don’t know about you, but
I’d rather work with a friend. Even if your game isn’t a fit with a publisher, they might
be friendly back by suggesting a company or publisher who they think might like your
game. People are much more inclined to help an up-­and-­coming designer who is polite
and friendly!
Never give up: Even the most successful game designers have their moments of
doubt. The rejection can wear you down, but if you are persistent and you want to have
a published game bad enough, (and if you have designed a good game), then odds are
that you will eventually get published. There are many game publishers out there, and
each one is a potential opportunity to get your game published. Don’t stop until you’ve
talked to everyone!
Always thank them: No matter what the outcome is of your pitch, no matter how
badly it went, no matter how much they didn’t like your game, always thank the publisher for their time. Not only is it polite, but even if you don’t sell your game, you are
selling yourself. There might be other opportunities in the future for you to work with
that publisher, and no one wants to work with a rude jerk. The game industry is too
small, and word gets around. “Be friendly, be helpful, and be grateful” has served me
well in my career.

Contracts and Money
Money is often an awkward thing for people to talk about. Creative people, like game designers, often are uncomfortable talking about money and asking for money. But you need to
know something about contracts; otherwise, you might find yourself in a bad situation.
Let me start out by saying that I am no lawyer. If you have any questions, consult a lawyer,
preferably one with experience in the entertainment or publishing world. All the knowledge
I’m about to share with you, I’ve learned the hard way during my career in board gaming.

Licensing Your Game
There are two ways that a publisher can “own” your game. The first is by selling your game.
The publisher buys your game outright. You are selling your game to the publisher. They own
all of the rights; they own the intellectual property. Everything. Once you have been paid for
your game, you are expected to not be involved in the game; it is out of your hands. Some
designers don’t mind doing this. Once they’ve made the game, they trust the publisher to do
what is best for it.

373

374

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

I prefer licensing when working with a game to a publisher. You are not selling it or creating
it as work-­for-­hire, you are letting the publisher publish it for a predetermined period of
time. Your contract should state when the license expires and thus the rights return to you.
Common time frames are 5 or 7 years. There can be a stipulation in the contract that if the
publisher decides not to do another print run, the rights return to you. It is important to
have the rights of your game return to you because a good game design can be resold to
another publisher. Accomplished designer Reiner Knizia often does this with his many popular games. They are often either re-­issued with new artwork or a new theme.

Credit Where Credit Is Due
While money is great, fair credit might be the most important thing for a game designer to
include in a contract. In the end, while the money is nice, all you really have are your credits.
Your contract should specify that your name is credited on the box (preferably the front) and
in the game’s manual. You’d be surprised at how often designers have been robbed of credit
from publishers. Be aware that often, especially with licensed games, the licensor won’t want
your name on the box cover. Fight for credit if you must, but at least push to get your name
on the back of the box!
Be firm on how you are credited. Game designer? Inventor? Creator? Also demand to be
listed on the BGG website, in Amazon listings, and in the game’s promotional material. Even
if you aren’t credited on the front of the box, you want proof that you designed the game.

The Advance
Games take time and money to make. Your time (and your money) is worth something.
A game designer should always get paid to sign their game to a publisher—­just like how
screenwriters are paid for their scripts by a film production company. The question is, how
much should you get paid? This amount is called an advance because it is the money you get
in advance of the production and sale of the game.
An average advance is anywhere from $500 to $3,000, often depending on the experience of
the game designer. In your contract, you need to specify how long after signing the contract
you will be paid the advance. You should clarify whether your advance comes out of your
royalty—­that is to say, when your game starts earning money, how much money does it
need to earn before you start getting paid? For example, some publishers will let you keep
