The design becomes easier to manage for the designer and easier to implement for
programmers and artists, and the game becomes easier to learn for the player. In our
simulation examples (Diablo’s inventory, health points and dice in Kriegsspiel, and
jumping in Super Mario Bros.), using analogous and symbolic simulation resulted in a
simpler rule system than an iconic simulation would have. Compared with a completely detailed, realistic simulation, analogous and symbolic simulation aims to
capture the essence of the source system with fewer elements.
In terms of Machination diagrams, analogous simulation reduces the number of
elements in the diagram by replacing similar mechanisms with only one mechanism. Symbolic simulation goes one step further, by connecting mechanics in the
game where they would not be connected directly in the real world. As is the case
with the use of symbols in spoken and written language, some symbolic simulations
work better than others. The symbols that work best seem to connect two unrelated
rules that still have some affinity between them. In the case of Super Mario Bros.,
there is a natural relationship between the physical skill and timing involved in
both jumping and fighting.
When used correctly, abstracting features to produce analogous and symbolic simulation reduces the number of elements in a system without affecting its structural
complexity (for example, the number of feedback loops) and emergent properties
too much. This has three advantages:

meaninGFUL mechanics

293

Because the game removes unnecessary detail, it allows the player to focus on
the structural features and strategic interaction that is allowed. (It also reduces the
complexity of the user interface, which many players appreciate.) As we have seen
throughout this book, these structural features drive emergent behavior. By offering
a simpler version that is easier to understand, games can train players to understand
far more detailed complex systems in real life.

n

A system that uses analogous and symbolic simulation can allow a complete
session of play in much less time than the system that the play represents could
run with many complex systems represented. The player learns the results of his
actions and decisions fast and efficiently. On the one hand, this allows players to
go through the process more often, and on the other hand, it will contribute to the
pleasurable experience of agency and power that drives many commercial entertainment games. (In contrast, scientific and engineering simulations, with their
emphasis on accuracy, often run much slower than real time.)

n

For game designers, game systems that are reduced to their essence are easier to
manage and easier to balance. Without many parts, the designer can focus on those
elements and structures that contribute directly to the game’s emergent behavior
and more easily tweak that behavior into the desired shape. Games would do well
to strive for symbolic or analogous, emergent gameplay rather than detailed realism.
It is economically more feasible, and it allows more effective communication. (The
audience’s preferences will influence this, however: Hardcore racing fans will not be
content with Mario Kart.)

n

systems do not have to have many parts and mechanisms to create many different meanings. spoken language serves as a good example. Linguist noam chomsky observed that
in language, our vocabulary might be large but is essentially limited (most people know
tens of thousands of words). Yet, the number of things you can say is infinite (or at least
unlimited). This is because we can combine words in many different ways and still make
sense of them. We write a book using language, and there is no upper bound on how
long that book may be. chomsky called this characteristic of language discrete infinity:
the possibility to make infinite use of discrete means (1972, p. 17).
discrete infinity is a useful concept that applies well to games. To create discrete infinity, the number of elements is not as important as the number of possible connections
between the elements. it means that as a game designer you should always be on the
lookout to create systems where the number of meaningful combinations is large and
possibly endless. That way, you can never know exactly what might come out of the
system. This constitutes a risk: You might get unexpected results. But it is a good way to
create a game from which more can come out than you’ve put in.

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

Super Mario Bros. is a great example of gameplay design in which only a handful of
game mechanisms are combined in many interesting challenges. The value of each
mechanism does not arise from its power to represent a realistic aspect of exploring
a forest or a dungeon but from the interesting combinations these mechanics allow.
The exploration challenges offered by the game are almost always the result of combinations of simple, reusable gameplay mechanics that are often quite analogous
or symbolic.
The meaning that emerges from symbolic and analogous games is not necessarily
less detailed or less valuable than games that aim for detailed and realistic simulation. On the contrary, as the challenges in game are more abstract, the skills and
knowledge the game addresses are more generic. As we already mentioned in our
discussion on semiotics, in communicating knowledge effectively, language benefits from having many symbolic constructions. In the same way, the message of a
game that is less iconic is more applicable outside the particular setting of the game.
This is especially useful when one wants to express something through a game
that has value beyond the game and its immediate premise. What you learn from
Monopoly applies to many situations both in games and in real life. You would learn
less if Monopoly tried to be a precisely realistic simulation of the real estate market in
Atlantic City, New Jersey (where the original version of Monopoly is set).

Multiple layers of Meaning
The most monumental works of art in human history have different layers of meaning that appeal to different audiences. According to semiotician Umberto Eco,
Shakespeare was a master of this aspect of creating works of art (2004, p. 212–235).
In Shakespeare’s time, his plays had a strong popular appeal to the general audience.
They had romance, drama, humor, and tragedy that was accessible to everyone.
At the same time, Shakespeare’s plays also appealed to the social and political élite,
because although many of the plays were set in distant times and distant lands, they
frequently commented on current social and political affairs of the day. Moreover,
Shakespeare managed to do all these things while writing beautiful prose and poetry
that is appreciated even today.
Umberto Eco points out that having multiple layers of meaning in a single work of
art is good for three reasons:
n

It gives the work a wide appeal to many people.

It invites the audience to explore the work in different ways (you might say it
creates replay value).

n

Contrast and contradictions between different layers of meaning create the
opportunity for humor and irony.

n

meaninGFUL mechanics

295

Games are not different from other media in this respect: They can also create different layers of meaning. They have a natural capacity for this, because games
communicate through the signals they produce but also through the mechanics
that produce the signals. There are many games that make good use of these different layers of meaning. In the following sections, we’ll discuss a few examples.

Unrelated Meanings
Shakespeare’s plays appealed to different levels of his highly class-stratified society
by offering them different forms of entertainment suited to their interests, even if
they were unrelated to one another. He included political satire for the élite and
dirty jokes and puns for the peasants (though the élite may have enjoyed them
as well). The fact that he was able to do this in a single play, while still preserving
its harmony, is a measure of his genius. For example, Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy
about love and feuding families, but it begins with an extended riff of silly wordplay
intended to set even the least educated in the audience giggling. The wordplay then
evolves into swordplay and becomes more serious.
One of the best recent examples of a game that offers multiple unrelated layers of
meaning is Bioshock. On the surface, Bioshock is a survival horror first-person shooter
with some role-playing game elements. The player can, if he wants to, ignore
everything else and concentrate on surviving, amorally killing his opponents, and
optimizing his attributes. We might call this the physical layer of Bioshock.

At another level still, and unrelated to gameplay, the player can appreciate the
extraordinary Art Deco landscape of the game. Bioshock’s art is so stunning that it
has been printed and sold as a coffee-table book, a rare achievement for a video
game. Neither the physical nor the moral aspects of the game depend on the artwork; it is simply another part of the entertainment in its own right. We call it the
aesthetic layer of Bioshock.
Finally, and only noticeable by those who are familiar with political theory, Bioshock
is a satire on Ayn Rand’s philosophy of Objectivism. (The founder of the game’s
world is named Andrew Ryan, an intentional reference—in fact, an indexical sign—
to Ayn Rand.) Objectivism is a variant of Libertarianism that argues (among many
other things) for “uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism” (Rand 1964,
p. 37). Bioshock offers a vision of what might happen if an Objectivist society were
to engage in uncontrolled, unregulated biological experimentation: disaster and
destruction. This is the political layer of Bioshock.

ChAptEr 12

At another level, the player can take the game’s moral choices seriously and try to
play the game without harming innocent characters known as Little Sisters. He is
not obliged to do so. It is riskier, and the game offers larger short-term rewards if the
player simply kills them. But he experiences different gameplay, and gets a different
ending, if he does avoid killing them. This is the moral layer of Bioshock.

296

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

Bioshock’s physical and moral layers of meaning are provided by its mechanics,
which enforce the player’s need to survive and calculate the effects of his moral
decision-making. The aesthetic layer of meaning comes from its artwork, and the
political layer from its story, told through moments of narration. It is not a game to
be emulated easily, but it is well worth studying.

Contrast between Appearance and Mechanics

T I P You can play
September 12 online at
www.newsgaming.com/
games/index12.htm.

September 12, designed by Gonzalo Frasca, states on its instruction screen that it
is not a game but a simulation that allows users to “explore some aspects of the
war on terror.” It presents the user with an isometric perspective of what looks
like a cartoonish Arabic city (Figure 12.6). In the city, civilians and terrorists walk
around; the terrorists are visibly carrying guns. As the player, you can launch missiles at them, which will destroy buildings and kill terrorists and civilians on impact.
However, it is hard to aim the missiles precisely, and they do a lot of collateral damage. Most importantly, civilian casualties cause other civilians to transform into
terrorists. The best way to keep the number of terrorists under control is to do nothing, because over time the terrorists transform into citizens. As a simulation it is a
very simplistic representation of the war on terror. September 12 might refuse to be
called a game, but it definitely is not an iconic simulation, either.

FIGURe 12.6
September 12

The significance of September 12 for a large part arises from the contrast it creates
between its appearance and the way its mechanics operate. In appearance, September
12 looks very much like a cartoony shooter game, not unlike many similar games
you can find on the Internet. However, the mechanics are set up in a way that
goes against the typical shooter game: shooting doesn’t get you closer to the goal,
assuming the goal is to get rid of the terrorists. September 12 cleverly makes use of

meaninGFUL mechanics

297

the user’s expectations set by countless games to set them on the wrong foot. The
discovery that September 12 goes against their expectations creates a meaningful
turning point that drives home the argument September 12 makes: Indiscriminate
brute force is an ineffective way to deal with the problem of global terrorism.
September 12 is a good example of simplicity in design, which uses a contrast
between different layers of meaning to drive home the point it tries to make.
Because of its reference to shooter games, it has a lot of popular appeal, while the
hundreds of thousands of letters its designer received after its release indicates that,
though it did not please them all, many players caught the message.
A similar contrast between appearance and mechanics can be found in Brenda
Brathwaite’s 2009 tabletop game Train (Figure 12.7). In this case, the roles of
appearance and mechanics are the opposite of what they were in September 12. The
rules are simple and rather vague, while a correct interpretation of the meaning of
the game’s appearance creates a powerful contrast. The rules of the game require
you to race railroad cars to a destination and pick up as many yellow passengers as
possible. As you play, there are several hints that something is amiss. The passengers
are transported in freight cars, and the broken window that serves as the “board”
creates a disturbing ambiance. When the first train reaches its final destination, the
location is revealed to be a Nazi death camp. Just when you think you have won a
game, you’ve been made an accomplice in one of history’s greatest atrocities. Even
claiming ignorance at this point (“I didn’t know; I was just playing a game”) leaves
you to wonder whether or not you should have picked up on the hints. The broken glass is a reference to the Kristallnacht, the coordinated nationwide attack on
German and Austrian Jews in 1938 that left the streets littered with broken glass, and
the passengers are yellow because Jews were forced to wear yellow stars in occupied
Europe during World War II.

Intertextual Irony
Difference in meaning between multiple layers of a game can be used to create an
effect that Umberto Eco refers to as intertextual irony. Intertextual irony is created
when a game’s (or book’s or film’s) style refers to well-known genres or settings outside the game, while at the same time contrasting that message with an opposed
meaning on a different layer. A game that uses intertextual irony a lot is Grand Theft
Auto III and its successors.
Grand Theft Auto III offers many layers of meaning. First there is the game itself,
with its mechanics that allow the player to steal cars and commit various acts
of crime. For that reason it has been called a joyride simulator or a “SimCrime”
game. The game is set in a city that resembles New York. Many of the city’s sites
and inhabitants refer to real locations and common stereotypes. The game is filled
with references to popular culture. You can find many advertisements in the virtual
environment for brands that look convincing at first glance but are quite ironic
at a second glance. For example, you might see an ad for a film called Soldiers of
Misfortune, with the tagline “They left together but come back in pieces,” which
sounds like a typical movie tagline but whose meaning is quite the opposite of the
usual blockbuster bravura. The car radios offer a choice of soundtracks complete
with fictional commercials and weird jingles that sound right but are really disturbing if you pay closer attention to them. For example, one radio station proudly
advertises that it owns several networks and satellites but also ten senators. You hear
commercials for a company that mails pets in boxes and a reality television show
that has ex-convicts fight it out in the city streets with real weapons until there is
only one left standing. Playing this game, it is hard to miss all these references and
jokes, and it satirically suggests a relationship between the criminal lifestyle of the
game’s main character and the over-the-top consumer society he is part of. If anything, Grand Theft Auto III is a deeply satirical game that holds up a distorted mirror
to society. The game mechanics generate a vast accumulation of wealth that anybody within the world of Grand Theft Auto seems to aspire to, no matter what the
methods of accumulation are.
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas provides another good example of intertexual irony
based on the contrast between appearance and game mechanics. In San Andreas the
player character needs to shop for clothes; the more expensive his clothes are, the
greater his sex appeal is, a vital statistic required to succeed in certain scenarios. One
of the most expensive shops is called Victim (Figure 12.8). On the one hand, the
shop name alludes to the urban gangster lifestyle the character and player supposedly identify themselves with, but at the same time, you should wonder who exactly
is the victim here when your character finds himself spending thousands of dollars
on a new outfit. Your character’s criminal lifestyle means he can get the money he
needs to buy outfits at this exclusive shop, but he risks his life in doing so, adding a
completely different dimension to the shop’s slogan “to die for.”

Grand Theft Auto:
San Andreas

According to Umberto Eco, one of the positive effects of using intertextual irony is
that it invites the audience, no matter what its background is, into a more reflective attitude about the work. In contrast, America’s Army lacks any hint of satire in
spite of the peculiarity that all the players consider themselves to be American soldiers—good guys—and consider all others to be insurgents. The game implements
complete moral relativism: No one is unequivocally the good guy. To those who are
paying attention, it invites the question, “if we’re all alike, why are we fighting?”
But it takes itself too seriously for that. Players of America’s Army are never prompted
to reflect on this situation.

For the final chapter of our book we have examined ways to communicate messages
with games, particularly with game mechanics. We defined serious games and discussed what they’re for and how they work. We also looked at how entertainment
games such as Grand Theft Auto III use elements of satire to make fun of their own
premise. Communication theory and semiotics both offer useful models for thinking about how a game can represent ideas and convey them to its players. You can
use analogous and symbolic simulation as tools to communicate meaning efficiently,
without trying to represent real-world ideas exactly. And finally, by creating games
with multiple layers of meaning, you can build especially rich experiences for your
players, games that transcend light entertainment and approach the status of artworks.
We hope you have enjoyed Game Mechanics and found it useful. Although we have
not concentrated on particular genres or on software implementation techniques,
we feel that the tools we have offered—in particular the design patterns and the
Machinations framework and tool—will be invaluable in your career as a game
designer, no matter what kind of games you design. Thank you for reading!

Exercises
1. Choose a serious game (or your instructor will assign one). What message does
it try to convey? Does it convey that message through its mechanics or by some
other means? If it does use the mechanics, analyze them and explain how the
player infers the message from their operation.

2. Choose a game with a strong simulation element (or your instructor will assign
one). What mechanisms in the game are iconic, what mechanisms are indexical or
analogous, and what mechanisms are symbolic? Explain why.

3. Choose a game (or your instructor will assign one). Which aspects of the game
do you feel are truthful about their subject matter, and which ones lie? Be sure to
distinguish simplification from outright falsehood. If the game is a serious game,
do you feel the falsehoods undermine the game’s intent, or are they acceptable?

4. We gave Bioshock as an example of a game with multiple layers of meaning that
were not closely related but permitted the player to play and appreciate the game
on several levels. Can you think of another? Explain what the different levels were.
Was the result harmonious?

5. We mentioned September 12 and Train as examples of games whose appearance
contrasts with their mechanics. Can you think of others? What do you think the
designers intended by including such a contrast?

6. The Sims and Grand Theft Auto III both satirize materialism and consumer culture.
The Sims does so gently, Grand Theft Auto III much more harshly. Can you think of
other games that also work as satire? How, and what do they make fun of?

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

A static engine generally does not inspire long-term strategies: Collecting resources
from a static engine, if possible at all, will be quite obvious.

implementation
Normally, it is simple to implement a static engine: A single source that produces the
energy will suffice. It is possible to add multiple steps in the energy production, but
in general this will add little to the game.
A static engine can be made unpredictable by using some form of variation in the
production rate. An unpredictable static engine will force the player to prepare for
periods of fewer resources and reward players who make plans that can withstand
bad luck. The easiest way to create an unpredictable static engine is to use randomness to vary the output level of resources or the length of time between moments of
production, but skill or multiplayer dynamics could work as well.
The outcome of random production rates can be, but does not need to be, the same
for every player. By using an unpredictable static engine that generates the same
resources for all players, the luck factor is evened out without affecting the unpredictability. This puts more emphasis on the planning and timing that the pattern
introduces. An example would be a game in which all players secretly decide how
many resources all players can get. The lowest number will be the number of
resources to enter play for everyone, while the players who proposed the lowest can
act first. This would automatically set up some feedback from the game’s current
state to this mechanism. (This system discourages inflation.)

examples
The energy produced by the spacecraft in Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance is an example
of a static engine. The energy can be diverted to boost the player’s shields, speed, and
lasers. This is a vital strategic decision in the game, and the energy allocation can be
changed at any moment. The amount of energy generated every second is the same
for all spacecraft of the same type (Figure B.1).

In many turn-based games, the limited number of actions a player can perform in
each turn can be considered a static engine. In this case, the focus of the game is
the choice of actions, and generally players cannot save actions for later turns. The
fantasy board game Descent: Journeys in the Dark uses this mechanism. Players can
choose between one of three actions for their hero every turn: move, attack, or prepare a Special Action (Figure B.2). In our diagram, a player gets two actions every
turn and can perform the special action only once per turn. This creates five possible combinations: The player can attack twice, move twice, attack and move, attack
and do a special action, or move and do a special action.

Motivation: A dynamic engine produces a steady flow of resources and opens the
possibility for long-term investment by allowing the player to spend resources to
improve production. The core of a dynamic engine is a positive constructive
feedback loop.

n

applicability
Use a dynamic engine when you want to introduce a trade-off between long-term
investment and short-term gains. This pattern gives the player more control over
the production rate than a static engine does.

The dynamic engine produces energy that is consumed by a number of actions. One
action (Invest) produces upgrades that improve the energy output of the dynamic
engine. A dynamic engine allows two different types of upgrades a player can invest
in to improve its production:
n

The frequency at which energy is produced

n

The number of energy tokens generated each time

The differences between the two are subtle. A high frequency will create a steady
flow, while a high number (but low frequency) will lead to bursts of energy.

consequences
A dynamic engine creates a powerful positive constructive feedback loop that probably needs to be balanced by some pattern implementing negative feedback, such
as any form of friction. Alternatively, balance it by using escalation to create challenges of increasing difficulty.
When using a dynamic engine, you must be careful not to create a dominant strategy, either by favoring the long-term strategy too much or by making the costs for
the long-term strategy too high.
A dynamic engine generates a distinct gameplay signature. A game that consists of
little more than a dynamic engine will cause the players to invest at first, appearing
to make little progress. Beyond a certain point, the player will start to make more
progress and needs to try to do so at the quickest possible pace.

implementation
The chance of building a dominant strategy that favors either long-term or shortterm investment is reduced when some sort of randomness is introduced in the
dynamic engine. However, the positive feedback loop that exists in an unpredictable

desiGn PaT Tern LiBrarY

307

dynamic engine will amplify the luck a player has in the beginning of the game,
which might result in too much randomness quickly.
The outcome of random production rates can be, but does not need to be, the same
for every player. By using an unpredictable dynamic engine that generates the same
resources for all players, the luck factor is reduced without affecting the unpredictability. This puts more emphasis on the player’s chosen strategy.
Some dynamic engines allow the player to convert upgrades back into energy, usually against a lower rate than the original investment. When upgrades are expensive
and the player frequently needs large amounts of energy, this becomes a viable option.

In StarCraft, one of the abilities of Space Construction Vehicle (SCV) units is to harvest minerals that can be spent on creating more SCV units to increase the mineral
harvest (Figure B.3). In its essence, this is a dynamic engine that propels the game
(although in StarCraft the number of minerals is limited and SCV units can be killed
by enemies). It immediately offers the player a long-term option (investing in many
SCV units) and a short-term option (investing in military units to attack enemies
quickly or respond to immediate threats).

The economy of The Settlers of Catan revolves around a dynamic engine affected
by chance. The roll of the dice determines which game board tiles will produce
resources at the start of each player’s turn. Building more villages increases the
chance to receive resources every turn. The player can also upgrade villages into
cities, which doubles the resource output of each tile. The Settlers of Catan gets
around the typical signature a dynamic engine creates by allowing different types
of invest actions and by measuring upgrades instead of energy to determine the
winner. See the section “Producing Progress Indirectly” in Chapter 11, “Progression
Mechanisms,” for a more detailed discussion and diagram for The Settlers of Catan.

n

Motivation: Two resources that can be converted into each other fuel a feedback
loop that produces a surplus of resources. At least one of the converters must output
more resources than it takes in to create the surplus. The converter engine is a more
complicated mechanism than most other engines but also offers more opportunities
to improve the engine. As a result, a converter engine is nearly always dynamic.

n

applicability
Use a converter engine when:
You want to create a more complex mechanism to provide the player with more
resources than a static or dynamic engine provides. (Our example converter engine
contains two interactive elements, while the dynamic engine contains only one.) It
increases the difficulty of the game because the strength and the required investment of the feedback loop are more difficult to assess.

consequences
A converter engine introduces the chance of a deadlock. When both resources dry
up, the engine stops working. Players run the risk of creating deadlocks themselves
if they forget to invest energy to get new fuel. Combine a converter engine with a
weak static engine to prevent this from happening.
A converter engine requires more work from the player, especially when the converters need to be operated manually.
As with dynamic engines, a positive feedback loop drives a converter engine. In most
cases, this feedback loop needs to be balanced by applying some sort of friction.

The number of steps involved in the feedback loop of a converter engine strongly
affects how hard it is to make it operate efficiently. More steps increase the difficulty; fewer steps reduce the difficulty. At the same time, more steps offer additional
opportunities for tuning or adding to the engine.
With too few steps in the system, the advantages of the converter engine are limited,
and you might consider replacing it with a dynamic engine. Too many steps might
result in an engine that is cumbersome to operate and/or maintain, especially in a
board game in which the different elements of the engine usually cannot be automated.
It is possible to create an unpredictable converter engine by introducing randomness, multiplayer dynamics, or skill into the feedback loop. This complicates the
converter engine further and often increases the chance that a deadlock will occur.
Many implementations of the converter engine pattern put a limiter somewhere
in the cycle to keep the positive engine under control and to keep the engine from
producing too much energy. For example, if the number of fuel resources that can
be converted each turn is limited, the maximum rate at which the engine can run
is capped. In a Machinations diagram, you can use a gate node to limit the flow of
resources. In an automobile, the car’s engine converts fuel into energy, which drives
the fuel pump; the fuel pump consumes some of that energy to send more fuel to
the engine. This creates a positive feedback loop that is limited by the throttle.

examples
The 1980s-era space trading computer game Elite features an economy that occasionally acts as a converter engine. In Elite, every planet has its own market, selling
and buying various trade goods. Occasionally, players will discover a lucrative trade
route where they can buy one trade good at Planet A, sell it at a profit at Planet B,
and return with another good that is in high demand on Planet A again (Figure B.4).
Sometimes these routes involve three or more planets. Essentially, such a route is
converter engine. It is limited by the cargo capacity of the player’s ship, which can
be enlarged for a price. Other properties of the player’s ship might also affect the

implementation

effectiveness of the converter engine: The ship’s “hyperspeed” range and its capabilities (or cost) to survive a voyage through hostile territories all affect the profitability
of particular trade routes. Eventually, trade routes become less profitable as the player’s efforts reduce the demand, and thus the price, for certain goods over time (a
mechanism that is omitted from the diagram).

FIGURe b.4

The player’s location on Planet A or Planet B activates the converters that implement the trading mechanisms in the center. A few possible ship upgrades are
included on the right.
A converter engine is at the heart of Power Grid (Figure B.5), although one of the
converters is replaced by a more elaborate structure (see the section “Elaboration
and Nesting Patterns” in Chapter 7, “Design Patterns”). The players spend money
to buy fuel from a market and use that fuel to generate money in power plants.
The fiction of the game is that players generate and sell electricity. However, the
game mechanics do not model electricity itself; players simply convert fuel directly
into money. Surplus money is invested in more efficient power plants and connecting more cities to the player’s power network. The converter engine is limited:
The player can earn money only for every connected city, which effectively caps
the money output during a turn. Power Grid also has a weak static engine to prevent
deadlocks: The player will collect a small amount of money during a turn even if
the player failed to generate money through power plants. The converter engine of
Power Grid is slightly unpredictable as players can drive up the price of fuel by stockpiling it, which acts as a stopping mechanism at the same time.

Building mechanisms increase the output of the engine. If energy is required to activate building mechanisms, then a positive, constructive feedback loop is created.

consequences
The engine building increases the difficulty of a game. It is best suited to slowerpaced games because it involves planning and strategic decisions.

implementation
Including some form of unpredictability is a good way to increase difficulty, generate varied gameplay, and avoid dominant strategies. Engine building offers many
opportunities to create unpredictability because the core engine tends to consist
of many mechanisms. The complexity of the core engine itself usually also causes
some unpredictability.
When using the engine building pattern with feedback, it is important to make sure
the positive, constructive feedback is not too strong and not too fast. In general, you
want to spread out the process of engine building over the entire game.

desiGn PaT Tern LiBrarY

313

An engine building pattern operates without feedback when energy is not required
to activate building mechanisms. This can be a viable structure when the engine
produces different types of energy that affect the game differently and allows the
players to follow different strategies that favor particular forms of energy above others. However, it usually does require that the activation of building mechanisms is
restricted in some way.

examples
SimCity is a good example of engine building. The energy in SimCity is money, which
is used to activate most building mechanisms. The mechanisms consist of preparing building sites, zoning, building infrastructure, constructing special buildings,
and demolition. The core engine of SimCity is quite complex with many internal
resources such as people, job vacancies, power, transportation capacity, and three
different types of zones. Feedback loops within the engine cause all sorts of friction
and effectively balance the main positive feedback loop, up to the point that the
engine can collapse if the player is not careful and manages the engine poorly.
In the board game Puerto Rico, each player builds up a New World colony. The colony
generates different types of resources that can be reinvested or converted into victory
points. The core engine includes many elements and resources such as plantations,
buildings, colonists, money, and a selection of different crops. Puerto Rico is a multiplayer game in which the players compete for a limited number of positions that
allow different actions to improve the engine; they compete for different building
mechanics. This way, a strong multiplayer dynamic is created that contributes much
of its gameplay.

The upgrade mechanism in a dynamic engine pattern also is an example of a building
mechanism. In fact, the dynamic engine is a simple and common implementation
of an engine building pattern. However, its simplicity means that a dynamic engine
allows only one or maybe two kinds of upgrades. The typical core engines in a game
that follow the engine building pattern allow for many more upgrade options.

The production mechanism produces energy that players need to use to perform

consequences
The static friction pattern is a relatively simple way to counter positive feedback
created by engine patterns. However, it tends to emphasize the long-term strategy
inherent to the dynamic engine because it reduces the initial output of the dynamic
engine but does not affect any upgrades.

implementation
An important consideration when implementing static friction is whether the consumption rate is constant or subject to some sort of randomness. Constant static
friction is the easiest to understand and most predictable, whereas random static
friction can cause more noise in the dynamic behavior of the game. The latter can

desiGn PaT Tern LiBrarY

315

be a good alternative to using randomness in the production mechanism. The frequency of the friction is another consideration: When the feedback is applied at
short intervals, the overall system will be more stable than when the feedback is
applied at long or irregular intervals, which might cause periodic behavior in the
system. In general, the effects of a continual loss of energy on the dynamic behavior
of the system are less powerful than a periodic loss of the same amount of energy.

In the Roman city-building game Caesar III, the player must pay tribute to the
emperor at particular moments during each mission. The schedule of the tribute
payments is fixed for each mission and not affected by the player’s performance.
In effect, they cause a very infrequent and high form of static friction that causes a
huge tremor in the game’s internal economy. See Chapter 9, “Building Economies,”
for a more detailed discussion of this game.
The dynamic engine in Monopoly is countered by different types of friction, including static friction (Figure B.6). The main mechanism that implements static friction
is the Chance cards through which the player infrequently loses money. Although
some of these cards take into account the player’s property, most of them do not.
You might think that paying rent to other players is also a form of static friction because
the frequency and severity of the payments are far beyond the direct control of the
player who has to pay. However, paying rent is an example of the attrition pattern, not
static friction. The rate of the friction does change over time, and players have some
indirect effect on it: When a player is doing well, chances are that his opponents
are not, which negatively affects this friction. The diagram in Figure B.8 does not
include this aspect because it is made from the viewpoint of an individual player.
