known as a campaign. Originally found in war games, campaigns became popular in tactical
adventure games like Star Wars: Imperial Assault (2014), Kingdom Death: Monster (2017),
Gloomhaven (2017), and Townsfolk Tussle (2022).
These games have what are known as a campaign mode where your characters change over
time so that the results of the previous game impact future games. This makes playing multiple games feel more like a grand adventure. In the best of them, the narrative evolves, the
player’s goals change, new enemies are revealed and defeated, and characters grow and
even die.
Rob’s great idea was to take what happened during a campaign and make it permanently
change the game. Risk Legacy (2011) was the first of a new kind of campaign game, known as
a legacy game. Legacy games are designed to be played over the course of a campaign, usually with the same players, and permanently change over time. A legacy game has several
distinctive design features from a campaign game.
■■

■■

■■

Stickers: At the start of the game, Risk Legacy’s rule book includes blank sections. As
certain objectives are achieved or after events happen in the game, you can take a
sticker from a separate sheet and place it into a blank space in the rule book. Once the
sticker is placed, the new rule goes into effect. This creates an element of surprise (as
well as making it easier for you to learn a new rule.
Optional rules: Some of the rule stickers in Risk Legacy give you a choice of two different rules. You must choose one and permanently dispose of the other.
Tearables: Risk Legacy’s box cover warns you that “What’s done can never be
undone”—­which foreshadows tearable components. Cards must be torn in half
once they are used. Envelopes and cardboard boxes must be ripped open to reveal new
components. For gamers who are used to keeping their games in good condition, this
can cause some real stress!
Personalization: In Risk Legacy, if you win a game, you can place a location sticker on
the game board and name it. There is also a section for the victor to sign after a game.
Hidden elements: Because some components are stored in envelopes and boxes, the
mystery of what they are is part of the fun. I don’t want to give away any of the secrets
of the game, but there is one hidden component in the game that delighted me when I
discovered it. Good luck to you!

The Legacy format made a big splash on the gaming industry, and by 2020 there were many
other legacy games including SeaFall (2016), Charterstone (2017), Betrayal Legacy (2018),
Pandemic Legacy Season 1 (2015), and Machi Koro Legacy (2019). Some of these were more
successful than others, and I personally believe that legacy games work best using designs
that have already been published. Because a legacy game plays with the fundamental rules,
having a firm foundation to stand on is a much better starting position for the players.

Upgrades
Unlike leveling up, which changes your character, upgrades are temporary—­like a sword has
a chance to break in combat or a potion that is discarded once it is drunk. These types of
consumables often are represented by tokens or cards that tell the benefit of the item
or upgrade.
Sometimes these upgrades are equipped into distinctive slots on the player’s board, giving
the player a limited number of upgrades and items that can be carried. Kingdom Death:
Monster (2015) has nine item slots on the player’s board. Some of the items can be placed
only in a specific slot—­such as boots on the foot slot or a torch in a hand slot. Some items
are larger or require two hands to use, which takes up more slots. Items, depending on
where they are placed, can create synergies that grant additional benefits to the player.
However, if the item is broken or lost, the player loses the benefit. Often, a player’s goal is
to combine these types of upgrades to create combinations that give the player multiple
actions, give them powers, cause more damage, or enact other effects during play.

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

Crafting
Crafting is another type of upgrade where two or more items are combined to create a more
efficient or more powerful item. Crafting is usually centered around a technology tree—­a
logical progression of items, vehicles, equipment, or powers. You might have to pay resources
to climb up the tech tree, or they might be earned when leveling up. For example, a player
might be able to evolve their magical ability from a weak flame spell to a stronger flame blast
to a powerful fire ball.

Action Points
Action points are a currency that allows you to perform a predetermined number of actions
on your turn. They can be used to perform a wide range of actions—­from movement, to
combat, to drawing card, collecting resources, etc. For example, if you have four action points,
you can do four actions on your turn. Or you can spend them to do four points worth of
actions, such as spending 1 point to move, 2 points to attack, and 1 point to grab an item.
Actions that are considered more complex or beneficial can cost more action points. Action
points, unlike upgrades, are usually a fixed amount, and giving the player “more actions” is
considered a very powerful upgrade.

Action Selection
Action points are used to select actions.18 But what action will you select? You might select a
move action or an attack action or a collect resource action. You want to give your player a
wide selection of actions to choose from during their turn.
Want to make selecting actions even spicier? Have players select them in secret or simultaneously. This way, players cannot see what the other players are going to do, and this will
create some surprising and exciting moments. Simultaneous action selection works particularly well in competitive games. I also find that it helps speed up the action selection process.
Everyone gets to decide what to do and then reveal at the same time. No waiting around for
someone to make up their mind!
In my game Rayguns & Rocketships: Retaliation (2024), you can select from seven different
action cards and then reveal one at the same time as the other players. If two or more players
reveal the same card, they are penalized by getting to do only one of the actions. If you don’t
pick the same card, you get to do two actions. It creates a bit of a mind game that is played

Remember when I said that game design often uses the same term for different things? Well, action is one of
those terms. You can take an action on your turn, but your character also gets several actions and you can select
from a variety of actions available in the game. They’re all kind of the same thing—you are doing something—taking an action—­but the context and timing of those actions can be different.

18

321

between the players as you must decide if you want to try to avoid revealing the same card or
use it as a blocking technique to prevent another player from getting both actions.

In Colt Express (2014), simultaneously action selection works in another fun way. . .to create
chaos! In the game, you select a sequence of action cards that are “layered” into a single deck.
The cards are then revealed in the order that they have been stacked in the deck. With each
card drawn, that player executes their action. However, because you often don’t know what
the other player has picked or when it will be revealed in the deck, the actions can misfire,
resulting in hilarious misfortune for you or the other players.

Movement
I’ve mentioned that actions can be used for movement, but there are many ways that you can
move around in a thematic game. Traditionally, dice or some other randomizer—­like a
teetotum19—­determine how far your pawn or character can move. However, games that have
you “roll your dice to move your mice” are considered mostly passé by the board gaming community. There are a few rare exceptions of roll-­and-­move games—­Formula D has its clever
“dice as gears” mechanism—­but for the most part, until someone comes up with a new a
clever way to use dice to move, I recommend using some other means.
As a designer, I recommend letting your theme guide how something moves in your game.
Some thematic games have characters move a predetermined distance. And players can

A teetotum is a form of spinning top that is most used for gambling games. It has a polygonal body marked with
letters or numbers, which indicate the result of each spin. A dreidel is a type of teetotum. During the early 19th century, dice in board games were replaced with a teetotum because dice were associated with gambling, and you can’t
have gambling implements included in a game for the family! The problem with teetotums, is they kind of suck as
randomizers. They take forever to spin; tend to fly off tables, they can give somewhat unreliable results and you can’t
drop them down into something as cool as a dice tower that looks like a medieval castle.

upgrade their movement—­a horse will move faster and further than a character on foot. And
an airplane will move even faster and further than a horse.
In Magical Athlete (2002), each character has a special way of moving down the board. Some
of them are predetermined movement distances. Others may move only during conditional
situations. Every character has some sort of wacky rule. Here are a few examples of the fun
types of movement from this very original game:
■■

■■

■■

■■

Each time a male and female character share the same space, the cupid can advance
five spaces.
Instead of his turn, the merchant may change spaces with any other character. If
another player is way ahead of you, you can exchange places with them!
The martial artist skips over any space a character is in, allowing you to “hop” your way
down the board.
The ninja can choose to follow another character on their turn to the same space on
the board.

The challenge, as a designer, is to make something simple as moving interesting to the player.
What interesting movement mechanism can you think of?
My interesting movement is: ___________________________________________

Take-­That
Take-­that is a common mechanism in thematic board games. This is when an action done by
one player has a direct negative impact on another. It could be stealing a card or resources
from another player, forcing a player to discard, make a player move backward or into a trap
or bad situation, suffer a penalty, lose a turn, etc.

323

324

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Take-­that effects are usually instantaneous or short-­term and rarely have an ongoing long-­
term impact. This is considered one of the meaner board game mechanics. Take-­that is often
found in competitive games like Talisman (1983), Munchkin (2001), Guillotine (1998),
Exploding Kittens (2015), and Sorry (1929)

Fighting and Combat
A big part of many thematic games is combat, and there are many ways to do combat in a
game. The simplest is rock-­paper-­scissors, which is named after the classic kids’ game. In
rock-­paper-­scissors you have a minimum of three possible options, with each one having an
advantage over the other. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper. . .you get the idea.
However, rock-­paper-­scissors by itself is considered a bit too simplistic for today’s audiences.20
A more random, although no less dramatic method, is to use our old friend dice! Let’s look at
some methods of combat that use dice:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

In Dungeons and Dragons (and many other games), players roll a d20 to match or beat a
predetermined number. The numbers are often modified with plus or minus values. If
it is combat, a second roll is made to determine damage using a variety of sided die
(i.e., a dagger uses a d4, while a sword might use a d8).
In Last Night on Earth (2015), heroes roll a 2d6, while each zombie player rolls a 1d6.
The more zombies there are, the more dice are rolled! Players can use cards to add dice
or improve results.
In Risk (1959), players roll dice equal to the number of units. You compare the results
and then remove troops based on whose dice have higher numbers, while in Axis and
Allies (1981), you want to roll low numbers instead.
Games like HeroScape Master Set: Rise of the Valkyrie (2004), and Star Wars: X-­Wing
Miniatures (2012) use dice with custom symbols that represent blocking, hits, and
critical hits. The custom dice in Arcadia Quest (2014) have special critical hit symbols
that, when rolled, allow you to reroll. If you keep rolling the critical hit icon, you can
keep rerolling, doing more and more damage. This mechanism is known as exploding
dice and can be very exciting when it happens during gameplay!
In Dwellings of Eldervale (2020), battles are won by the single highest die rolled. Each
combatant puts forward their highest die. The goal is to have multiple high number
die results.
In Rayguns and Rocketships (2017), an attacker and defender roll dice to sword fight. If
the attacker’s result is higher than the defender, damage is dealt. If the defender’s die

20

CHAPTER 9

■■

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

is higher, the attack is blocked. If the numbers are the same, the defender ripostes and
then becomes the attacker.
In Dice Throne Season One (2018), each character has a chart of results that equals the
type of damage you can do. Dice are thrown Yahtzee style and if the symbols match the
result, you cause that damage to your opponent.

Dice aren’t the only way to represent combat. Deterministic combat is when a piece overtakes another piece, such as in Chess or Onitama (2014).
A deck of cards can be used for combat as well. Because cards can hold more information
than dice, they allow more flexibility in your design. Cards can be used to hold information
about attacking, damage, range, and blocking, as well as special abilities and exceptions.
■■

■■

■■

■■

Magic the Gathering (1993) has values for attack, defense, and special exceptions using
keywords for combat.
Blood Rage (2015) uses cards to increase the strength of the miniature unit in play. And
you can keep playing cards to increase the unit’s strength.
Scythe (2016) has a programmable wheel in which the player enters a value but can
increase the amount with cards.
Sleeping Gods (2021) has players flip a card onto an enemy board to indicate where and
how much damage is caused. This is similar to Catacombs (2010) and Dungeon Fighter
(2011) in which players flick tokens at a target to determine damage.

My favorite method of combat is:
______________________________________________________________________
Taking damage in combat means your characters need hit points. Hit points are a way to
track the health of a character, enemy, vehicle, or building. Once hit points reach zero, the
thing is removed from play. If it’s an enemy, you might earn experience, resources, victory
points, or treasure. If it is you that loses all your hit points, then that means death.

Player Death and Elimination
If you ask many board gamers, their least favorite mechanism is player elimination. No one
likes to be left out of the game, which is why player elimination has fallen out of favor as a
mechanism.
But just because players don’t like it doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t use it in your game
design. Player death can be an interesting player motivator in your game. You just must
be careful.
One way to avoid player elimination is to give players control over multiple characters. In
HeroClix (2002) or Unmatched: Battle of Legends Volume One (2019), players control a team of
characters. In Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game (2014) or Blood Rage (2015), you can have a
whole pool of characters. Characters in these games can still be defeated or killed, but because
you have several pieces to play, it is less likely that you will be eliminated from the game.
Some design resolves the player elimination problem by having the “dead” players join the
bad guy team. In Zombies!!! (2001) dead players can move zombie miniatures—­which results
in smarter, more aggressive zombies! In Who Goes There? (2018) human players work to prevent the Thing from spreading; however, when a player becomes a Thing, they are now trying
to escape the camp. Your objective changes once your character’s state changes. Personally,
I think this character elimination is a better solution than player elimination.

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

Area Control
You don’t always have to defeat the other players in a thematic game. You can just take over
the world! In thematic games with area control, players win or get points for controlling a
section of the board/map. This is most common in war games but can be seen in many other
types of games as well.
A variant of this is area majority where you only must control most of the board to win the
game. You don’t even need to take over all the areas. The areas on the board might have different values, or you might score points based on the amount of control they have in an area.
The player with the most pieces/units in an area is awarded the most points. Players in second, third, etc., often also get points, though less than the player in first. Area majority
makes for a faster game than complete control does, which is why it is gaining more
popularity.
Another variant of area control is king of the hill where all players try to control the same
space or spaces on the board. King of the hill games often use fewer characters than area
control games, but they have special abilities or even health to make them more valuable
and durable.
Combat games use another type of area control that uses more specialized units is MOBA—­
which is styled after Multiplayer Online Battle Arena gameplay found in video games. In a
MOBA, players are trying to defeat towers or a base to win the game. A stronger character
piece is often supported by weaker “creep” units. The battle pushes back and forth across the

327

328

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

board until one player destroys the other’s base. This is still a relatively new genre represented in games like Rum & Bones (2015), Mechs vs. Minions (2016), and LOAD: League of
Ancient Defenders (2016).

Timer
Because thematic games are about drama, sometimes you need a ticking clock to add tension
to the game. This can be a literal sand timer in which you have a limited time to make a move
or series of moves. If you want to get fancy, you can include a soundtrack or create an app
that uses music or sound effects to count down the remaining time.

Doom Track
One of my favorite systems is a doom track. This is a timer that, if the players don’t complete
their objectives or win the game, causes them to lose! Sure, it’s evil but it is exciting! There are
several ways that a player can push the doom track along—­draw a specific card, match a die
roll with a number of cards in play, fail an objective, or it just might happen at the end of
every round! There are many ways to torture your players!! Mu-­hahahahaha!

Race
Another type of track is a racetrack! The first to reach the finish line is the winner! The earliest games like Mehan and Senet were abstract race games, but with modern thematic games

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

they represent real-­world race events like Circus Maximus (1976), Formula D (2008), Flamme
Rouge (2016), or Heat: Pedal to the Metal (2022).
A race can also be the first player to finish an objective—­which can be as simple as reach 10
points first as in Catan (1995), be the first to escape a haunted house as in The Haunting
House (2003), or be the first to safely evacuate all your people from a sinking island as in
Survive: Escape from Atlantis! (1982).

Deduction
A popular genre in thematic games is mystery. Usually, there’s been a crime committed—­
such as a theft or a murder—­and it’s up to you to deduce who the criminal is and, presumably, bring them to justice! The first and most popular of this genre is Clue (1949) in which
three cards are removed from play—­a character, a weapon, and a location—­and through
deductive reasoning (and looking at other player’s cards), you can determine who the culprit
is.21 While the header of this paragraph says “deduction,” there are actually two types of reasoning that you can build your mystery around: inductive and deductive.
When you use inductive reasoning, you use experience and proven observations to guess
the outcome. The goal is to predict a likely outcome. Games with inductive reasoning gives
you the opportunity to gather facts (such as looking at another player’s cards as in Clue or
asking questions to another player such as in Twenty Questions) and apply the information
gained. Inductive reasoning allows you to begin with a starting point and narrow down your
assumptions to reach an informed conclusion. You might change your theory about who the
criminal is several times over the course of the game as new facts come to light and prove

21

It was Professor Plum, in the Conservatory with the Candlestick. It’s always that guy!

329

330

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

your previous theory incorrect. The disadvantage is when you don’t have enough evidence
but a condition in the game—­a timer or another player is ready to guess—­that cuts the evidence gathering process short.
Deductive reasoning uses theories and beliefs to rationalize and prove a specific conclusion. The goal is to prove a fact. This is when you use logic to determine whether something
is accurate. This allows you to make “leaps in logic” based on previously known information.
For example, in Libertalia (2012), each player has the same hand of cards to play on their
turn. An observant player can keep track of what cards the other players have played and use
that knowledge to decide which of their own cards should be played.
You can design your mystery game around either type of reasoning, but it’s often better to
stick to one type of reasoning or the other—­otherwise players are just making guesses,
which spoils the feeling of being engaged in a mystery. In a game where the players are cooperating against the game to solve a mystery (such as in the Exit or Unlock! series of games),
this is especially important.

I recently played a Star Wars–themed game where we found a blaster. The very next thing we
discovered was a door. Being familiar with the Star Wars movies, I used deductive reasoning
to assume that we could blast the door open—­something that happens all the time in the
movies. However, that wasn’t the case, and we were penalized. There was nothing in the
game that warned that we couldn’t use the blaster to open a door, so getting the negative
response was disappointing. The blaster was used later in the game, but by that point we had
tried it on three other items (another door, a security camera, and an Imperial guard) with no
results, so we were hesitant to use it in the way that eventually solved the puzzle.

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

You need to be clear with clues and how they help a player solve the mystery. In the rules you
need to be clear in explaining how solving the mystery is achieved. If the players can’t make
connections between the clues and the solution, then it just becomes a guessing game.
A good way to help this is to give players a way to check their reasoning over the course of the
game rather than in one fell swoop. Sometimes player aids like notepads help with this, especially when data contradicts each other and starts to get too confusing. I’ve found that writing a mystery can be hard, so here are a few ways to do so using game mechanisms instead:
■■

■■

■■

Start with a set of “knowns” and then remove one or more of them from the game (by
using a deck of cards, for example). Since the players know the known, they will be
looking at what is left to verify what is not out of the deck. This is what Clue does when
you remove three cards at the beginning of the game.
Have the game system narrow down the choices as you play. Werewolf does this by having werewolf players “kill” other players each night. The noose tightens as everyone
guesses out of the pool of the remaining players.
Have the game increase or decrease the likelihood of what the outcome will be. For
example, in Tragedy Looper (2011), the mastermind player can add intrigue tokens to a
suspect—­which either can activate that suspect’s ability or can be done to throw the
detective players off the scent of the real suspect.

Often in mystery games, there is a traitor. The traitor mechanic was defined in Chapter 5,22
but let’s talk about how use this mechanism in our game design.
To start, your design must be a cooperative game. Everyone must be working for a common
goal. To work together, you need to build trust. And to cause betrayal, you need to violate
that trust!

22

I know. That was a long time ago.

331

332

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Next all players should have a secret—­whether it’s a role or an ability. All players, regardless
of their role, must be able to do everything in the game. If a player can move, the traitor can
move too. If the player can collect resources, the traitor should be able to collect resources too.
The fun of a traitor mechanic game is when you realize someone you thought was on your
side wasn’t—­that’s why so many games with traitor mechanics are sci-­fi or horror themed
like The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31 (2017), Who Goes There? (2018), Dead of Winter: A
Crossroads Game (2014), or Battlestar Galactica the Board Game (2008).
Finally, when the traitor is revealed, does the game end, or does it keep going so the traitor
gets a chance to escape? That’s for you to decide!

Voting
Voting is when everyone gets to vote on something in the game. Players may each get one
vote, or it could be based on several resources. You may be able to vote all or nothing, choose
an effect, or bluff by making the other players think you are voting when you aren’t. The
result of the vote may change the in-­game state or prevent it from changing. Here are a few
ways voting can be used in a game:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

In Mafia (1981), players vote during the day round to try to uncover members of
the mafia.
In Dixit (2008), all picture cards are shown face up, and then players have to vote on
which picture was the storyteller’s.
In The Resistance (2009), each round begins with discussion. When ready, the leader
entrusts sets of plans to a certain number of players, and everyone votes on whether
to approve the assignment.
In Junta (1978), depending on the player’s office and the cards they hold, each player
has a certain number of votes. These are used to vote on the budget that the president proposes.
In Republic of Rome (1990), a player’s influence in votes is determined by the number of
senators they have recruited and the level of influence those senators have obtained.

Let’s Design a Thematic Game
Still with me? Ideally you aren’t suffering from cognitive overload! Let’s wrap our arms
around everything we’ve learned up until this point and make our own thematic game!
Whenever I think of thematic games, I think of classic fantasy dungeon crawls like DungeonQuest
and Hero Quest and Dungeon!, so let’s make one of those! Here’s what you’ll need:

1 sheet of illustration board (at least 12″ by 18″)
Pencil
Scissors
3d6
A sheet of sticker paper
36 tokens (1.25″ wide)
A black marker pen
4 fantasy miniatures

When building a prototype, especially a thematic one, you should include a component of
quality. This is a component that is close to the quality of what will be in the final game.
When I designed ALIEN: Fate of the Nostromo, I had a miniature alien figure (who my kids
named “Alan”) to inspire me. Alan kept me and my playtesters in the mood of the game as
we played.

For our game, you’ll need four fantasy miniatures. I recommend one knight, one wizard, one
archer, and one cleric, but you can pick whatever you want! You can find miniatures at any
tabletop game or comic bookstore that sells board games. You can order them from an online
store. You can even “borrow” them from another board game.

Now that we have your heroes, you need the dungeon for them to explore. In most dungeon
crawls, the play space is constructed of either square tiles or a traditional board. We’re going
to make something slightly different.

Step 1: Creating the Game Board/Tiles
For our game, you’ll need a stiff cardboard—­something that is thicker than a sheet of paper
because you will be picking them up and moving them on each turn. I suggest using an illustration board that is blank on both sides (it isn’t always) so that you can draw on it. If you
don’t consider yourself an artist, you can scan the images in this book, print them out, and
glue them onto the board.
You will want to cut the board into nine 8″ × 2″ (20.32 cm × 5.08 cm) strips like what is
shown in Figure 9.2.

Figure 9.2 Strips

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

On each strip, mark the lower-­right corner with the letter A, like what is shown in Figure 9.3.

Figure 9.3 A strip

Flip the strip over and mark the lower-­right corner with the letter B. You could even draw it
in a fancy medieval font like I did in Figure 9.4! This is so the back can be distinguished from
the front of the tiles, which is important to gameplay.

Figure 9.4 B strip

Thematic games are all about drama, and there’s nothing more dramatic than a ticking
clock—­a doom timer that counts down the time the player has left to survive. That’s what
these tiles and letters are for. But first, our tiles need to be dungeon tiles! Draw three rooms
on the “A” side of the tiles like Figure 9.5.

Figure 9.5 Tiles with rooms

Connect the rooms on the sides with hallways and on the top and bottom with hallways so it
looks like Figure 9.6.

Figure 9.6 Tiles with rooms with hallways

We’re going to do this for all of the remaining tiles, but feel free to mix it up a bit. Some
rooms will have only a hall on the top and bottom; others could have a bottom and side hallway. You want to create a twisting labyrinth for your heroes to explore! Figure 9.7 shows
more examples of tiles with rooms.

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

Figure 9.7 More examples of tiles with rooms

What matters most is that the way in and out is through these tiles because they will be
stacked in the game like what is shown in Figure 9.8 and they must connect; otherwise, the
game won’t work.

Figure 9.8 Tiles stacked to show connections

Next, repeat drawing the three rooms and their connecting hallways on the “B” side of the
tiles. Again, you can mix things up a little so that each side of a tile is a little different than
the other. You might want to blacken in the “negative space” on the tile, as shown in
Figure 9.9, to make it easier to see the individual rooms and hallways.

Figure 9.9 Blacked-­in tile

Flip the tiles back over to their “A” side. Set aside half (4 out of 9) of the tiles. On the remaining 5 tiles, draw a skull icon onto one of the rooms on the tiles similar to what is shown in
Figure 9.10. Be sure to mix it up from left, right, and center rooms.

Figure 9.10 A tiles with skull icon

Now on the “B” side, we are going to draw more skull icons, but this time, you will draw two
skulls on each tile—­with two exceptions. One tile should have three skulls, and one should
have no skulls. Your results should be similar to what is shown in Figure 9.11.

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

Figure 9.11 B tiles with skull icon

Step 2: Creating the Characters
Set aside your dungeon tiles. Let’s make our characters. You should have some illustration
board left over. The character boards don’t need to be very big—­as small as 2″ × 4″ cards.
Write the name of each of your four characters on them as shown in Figure 9.12.

Figure 9.12 Four player cards

Now let’s give our heroes asymmetrical powers! Write down the following on each card so
that the player can always keep it in front of them. Extra points for drawing a picture of the
character!
■■
■■

Knight—­Turn one blank die result into a sword.
Wizard—­Re-­roll one die on your turn.

■■

Cleric—­Remove one hit from an adjacent hero.
Archer—­Attack enemies up to three spaces away.

Step 3: Creating the Denizens and Hit Tokens
Next, some denizens are needed for your dungeon. You will need those tokens and a pen.
Break out your magnifiers and write the information in Table 9.1 onto your tokens. Each line
in the table should be written on a separate token, as shown in Figure 9.13. You’ll have one
token for each line.

Figure 9.13 Examples of tokens

On the token’s back, draw a skull to match those that you drew onto the dungeon tiles, as
shown in Figure 9.14. These tokens will be randomly placed on those spots during the game.

Figure 9.14 Example of back of token

You should have some tokens left (12 of them). These are going to be your hit tokens. Draw
the word “HIT” on each of them. You could even draw a blood splat on it like I did! (See
Figure 9.15.)

Step 4: Creating the Dice
Next, get your dice. Cut the stickers to cover the faces on the 3d6. You will then draw the following numbers and symbols on the dice:
Action dice 1: 1/1/2/2/3/3
Combat die 1: sword/sword/sword/two swords/skull/blank
Combat die 2: sword/sword/two swords/skull/skull/blank

Let’s see—­tiles, miniatures, character cards, tokens, dice. . .I think we have all the components we need to play this game. Wait, a second! We need the most important thing of all,
the rules!

Step 5: Create the Rules
I told you thematic game’s rules could be complex! There’s a lot going on in this game, which
means there are lots of systems to test and lots of design “knobs” to tweak!

Dungeon Crawl Rules for 1–4 Players
Setup

4.
5.
6.
7.

Vertically lace all nine tiles in a stack with the “A” side up.
Place all hero minis on the third tile from the bottom of this stack.
On each skull token, place a token face down (skull side up).
Place the remaining tokens nearby, skull side up.
Each player gets a character card.
Give each player three hit tokens.
The player who most recently read a fantasy book goes first.

Gameplay Rules
1. Roll the numbered action die to gain actions: move 1 room, attack 1 enemy, pick
up 1 token.

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

2. You may move your character up to that many spaces on the die.
3. You may only move to rooms that are connected by a hallway. You may move up or
down the stack to the next tile.
4. If you are one tile away from a skull token, flip it over to reveal it. You might be
revealing several tokens at once.
5. You cannot move past an enemy token. It must move or be defeated.
6. To pick up an item, you must spend an action. Place it on your character board.
7. To attack an enemy, you must be in the same room as the token. Roll the two
combat dice.

Check the combat results chart in Table 9.2.
If your hero takes three hits, they are removed from the game.
If all heroes are removed from the game, then everyone loses!
If you defeat an enemy, place the token on your character board.
After all heroes have taken their turn, move the “A” tile at the bottom of the stack,
flip it to the “B” side, and place it at the top of the stack.
Place skull tokens on this new “B” side if necessary.
If a character is caught when a tile moves, they take one hit and are moved up into
any unoccupied room on the tile above.
Continue in this way until all “A” tiles have been moved and flipped to “B” tiles.
When all the “B” tiles are showing, the game ends.
Calculate how many points in gold (on the skull tokens) each player has. Minus the
number of HIT tokens that player has. The player with the most points wins!

Solo Play Rules
Play the game in the exact same way but use three or four characters to play.

Step 6: Playtest the Game
With your rules in place, it is time to playtest! Remember, every time you change something
in your game, you need to know what effect it will have on your game. Pay attention to what
players are enjoying or finding frustration with your design. That way you can adjust your
gameplay to improve the game!
Track the feedback from playtesting your game here:
When I played with one player: ____________________________________________
Two players: ____________________________________________________________
Three players: ___________________________________________________________
Four players: ____________________________________________________________
A good thing to track when playtesting a game is how long it took to play. Go ahead and track
your play times below:
One-­player playtime: _____________________________________________________
Two-­player playtime: ____________________________________________________
Three-­player playtime: ___________________________________________________
Four-­player playtime: ____________________________________________________
What was the difference between all the playtimes? Always account for the “teach”—­the
time it takes players to set up and learn the rules of the game.

Step 7: Change the Rules
There are a lot of rules that can be changed. Here are the gameplay rules again with my
change, which replaces rule 16 from earlier:

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

Gameplay (Version 2.0)
1. Roll the numbered action die to gain actions: move one room, attack one enemy,
pick up one token.
2. You may move your character up to that many spaces on the die.
3. You may move only to rooms that are connected by a hallway. You may move up or
down the stack to the next tile.
4. If you are one tile away from a skull token, flip it over to reveal it. You might be
revealing several tokens at once.
5. You cannot move past an enemy token. It must move or be defeated.
6. To pick up an item, you must spend an action. Place it on your character board.
7. To attack an enemy, you must be on the same room as the token. Roll the two
combat dice.
8. Check the combat results on the table.
9. If your hero takes three hits, they are removed from the game.
10. If all heroes are removed from the game, then everyone loses!
11. If you defeat an enemy, place the token on your character board.
12. After all heroes have taken their turn, move the “A” tile at the bottom of the stack,
flip it to the “B” side, and place it at the top of the stack.
13. Place skull tokens on this new “B” side if necessary.
14. If a character is caught when a tile moves, they take one hit and are moved up into
any unoccupied room on the tile above.
15. Continue in this way until all “A” tiles have been moved and flipped to “B” tiles.
16. If a “B” tile is to be flipped, remove it from play.
17. When there is only one tile left, the game is over.
18. Calculate how many points in gold (on the skull tokens) each player has. Minus the
amount of HIT tokens that player has. The player with the most points wins!
This makes the game more deadly as the players run out of spaces! If you want to be a little
nicer to the players, perhaps there is a different rule you could create:
My rule change is: _________________________________________________
You always want to playtest any changes to the rules. Record your result here:
When I played with one player: _________________________________________

345

346

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Two players: ____________________________________________________________
Three players: ___________________________________________________________
Four players: ____________________________________________________________
You might notice that a rule change works great for one or two players, but not so great with
more players (or vice versa)—­it’s okay to write two or more sets of rules to accommodate for
those player counts.

Step 8: Change a Number
We also have lots of numbers to tweak. It could be the number of hits the player has, the
numbers on the dice, the different symbols on the die faces, the number of monsters versus
the number of treasures, or the number of dungeon tiles that are used in the game.
I think for my game, I will use my revised rules, but I will reduce the number of tiles to seven
in the stack rather than the original nine.
The number I changed was: _______________________________________________
Be sure to track what happened. Did you like the results?
What happened? _________________________________________________________

Step 9: Change the Objective
Let’s change the objective for the heroes. The game ends whenever a hero defeats five enemies, rather than running out of tiles. The following is the new version of the gameplay rules:
Gameplay Rules (Version 3.0)
1. Roll the numbered action die to gain actions: move one room, attack one enemy,
pick up one token.
2. You may move your character up to that many spaces on the die.
3. You may move only to rooms that are connected by a hallway. You may move up or
down the stack to the next tile.
4. If you are one tile away from a skull token, flip it over to reveal it. You might be
revealing several tokens at once.
5. You cannot move past an enemy token. It must move or be defeated.
6. To pick up an item, you must spend an action. Place it on your character board.

CHAPTER 9

7. To attack an enemy, you must be on the same room as the token. Roll the two
combat dice.
8. Check the combat results on the table.
9. If your hero takes three hits, they are removed from the game.
10. If all heroes are removed from the game, then everyone loses!
11. If you defeat an enemy, place the token on your character board.
12. After all heroes have taken their turn, move the “A” tile at the bottom of the stack,
flip it to the “B” side, and place it at the top of the stack.
13. Place skull tokens on this new “B” side if necessary.
14. If a character is caught when a tile moves, they take one hit and are moved up into
any unoccupied room on the tile above.
15. Continue in this way until all “A” tiles have been moved and flipped to “B” tiles.
16. If a “B” tile is to be flipped, instead remove it from play.
17. If a hero has defeated five enemies, gameplay ends.
18. Calculate how many points in gold (on the skull tokens) each player has. Minus the
amount of HIT tokens that player has. The player with the most points wins!

Step 10: Add a Mechanism
It’s time to add a new mechanism. While it can be exciting to have a lot of things going on in
a game, we should be mindful of adding more complexity. Go back through the book and
look at all the mechanisms we could add. There are so many to choose from! Which one
would you add?

Step 11: Change the Theme
If you aren’t a fan of dungeon-­crawls or fantasy, that’s okay because you can always retheme
the game! Think about the mechanisms—­the “moving” dungeon tiles, the enemy obstacles,
the health points, the combat, and action dice. . . . Find a theme that makes sense using your
existing mechanisms. Here are a few ideas for themes that could replace the fantasy one:
■■

■■

■■

The heroes are spaceships flying through outer space. The tokens could be enemy ships
and asteroids that you mine for fuel that lets you reroll the dice.
The heroes are commandoes fighting enemy soldiers like those seen in classic video
games like Contra or Metal Slug. You could even orient the tiles sideways to simulate
those side scrolling games!
Replace the heroes with post-­apocalyptic vehicles racing through dangerous terrain!
The tokens are obstacles that must be dodged or destroyed. The first player to the finish line (the final B tile) wins!

My new theme is:____________________________________________________

Hey! That’s a cool theme you picked!

Some Thematic Games to Play
Let’s talk about how you can get your new game out into the world! But first, here are few
great thematic games I think you should try:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Risk (1959)/Risk Legacy (2011)—­Risk is a fantastic gateway game into thematic games.
It’s a great mix of strategy and chance. However, it can get a bit repetitive, which is why
I love Risk Legacy. It takes the time-­honored, rock-­solid gameplay of Risk and adds even
more drama and depth to the original game. There are always new challenges, big dramatic moments, and surprises in (and under) every box.
Betrayal at House on the Hill (2004)—­This might be my all-­time favorite game, and it
requires several repeat plays just to experience all it has to offer. It has a modular board,
miniatures, tension, and 50 totally different ending scenarios. There have been three editions of this game, and I like the first and third ones myself. The legacy version (2018) is
quite good too.
Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game (2015)—­There are many, many zombie games out
there, but this captures the vibe of movies and TV shows like the Dawn of the Dead and
the Walking Dead so well. The odds are stacked against you—­the weather, limited
resources, the swings in fate, a possible traitor. Just like all zombie movies, the zombies are the least of your problems.
Colt Express (2014)—­Not only is Colt Express fantastic to look at, but it’s a hoot to play.
I love that the papercraft train is an integral part of the game, and I love the wacky
chaos that card programming creates. There are several neat expansions including a
certain time-­traveling DeLorean.
Scotland Yard (1983)/Fury of Dracula (1987)/Mister X (2009)—­These are all from the
“catch-­me-­if-­you-­can” genre—­in which one player is the villain and the others are trying to catch him. No matter which flavor of these games you try, you are in for an exciting game of cat-­and-­mouse.
Camp Grizzly (2013)—­There are several 80s slasher-­themed games, but this does it the
best. The game drips with theme, the art is beautiful (drawn by a Pixar artist), it’s fast
and easy to play but hard to win. Otis the bear-­themed killer is a fantastic villain. Sadly,
this game is hard to find and expensive when you find it.
Formula D (2008)—­Not all thematic games need to be about fantasy and sci-­fi. Formula
D is the best use of polyhedral dice since Dungeons and Dragons. You really feel like
you’re tearing up the racetrack when you chuck a 30-­sided die! And its adorable miniature race cars give this game fantastic table presence! There are tons of racetracks to
choose from too, so it’ll never get old!
Wings of Glory: WW2 Starter Set (2012)/Star Wars: X-­Wing Miniatures Game (2012)—­
These are great examples of a “board-­less” miniature game in which you measure the
distances between models to determine movement using a preprogrammed dial. Dice
