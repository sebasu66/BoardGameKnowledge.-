Geoff:
To Susan, for a wonderful 40 years, and to our children, Brian
and Sydney, for always challenging my strategies across the game
table, and challenging my ideas across the kitchen table.
Isaac:
To my wife, a quick nod of appreciation.
Let’s not make a scene about this.
To my children, Jesse, Alex, and Maya, you are
the gaming partners of a lifetime.
To my design partner, Matt Loomis, from whom I learned
more than I could contain in this slim volume.
Lastly, to my brother, Kuty Shalev, my constant gaming partner,

Foreword

ӶӶ

A game is a language.
In a way, when you sit down with someone to play Chess, Poker, or Cosmic
Encounter, you are beginning a conversation.
Each move you make in the game is a way for you to express yourself to
your partner—a way for you to make meaning. Every reckless aggression and
coy bluff, every greedy power grab and defensive stall for time is a word, a
phrase, a statement in the language of the game.
These conversations we have with each other, as we play games, can
be awkward and confusing. Or deliciously cruel. Or wildly creative and
unexpectedly beautiful. The kind of conversation that tickles parts of your
mind that you didn’t know were there, the kind of conversation that sticks with
you, turns acquaintances into bitter rivals, and later into the best of friends.
But a game is not just a language.
It’s more complicated than that. The moves we make as we play are a
language built on top of yet another language. Beneath the meaning we
express through the moves of the game is a kind of hidden grammar.
You move a pawn, pass a ball to a teammate, or maneuver your virtual
avatar: all of them are statements made through gameplay. But what are the
structures that make those meanings possible? The rules that permit action?
The blood and bones and spirit that animates the body of the game as it
is played?
That, exactly, is the subject of Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design. So
prepare yourself. Between these covers lies the hidden grammar of games. The
structures behind the structures. The DNA of fun.
This book is a dictionary for the secret language of games.
You see, although games and play are ancient human endeavors (the
Egyptian game Senet is at least 5,500 years old), it’s only in the twentieth
century that games shifted from folk culture to authored media. And as

xiii

xiv

Foreword

tabletop games, role-playing games, and video games have become industries
of their own, we’ve done our best to understand them.
If you are reading this book, you are likely to be a serious game player.
Like many others, you play games, discuss them, dissect them, and sometimes
even design new ones. And for many years, many smart designers, critics,
players, and scholars have been searching for the right way to talk about
games, to understand how they work, and to figure out how best to approach
the creation of new designs.
That’s why Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design is so significant. The
incredibly detailed pages that follow, pages that crack open the inner components
of tabletop games, constitute a kind of Rosetta Stone for game grammar.
Make no mistake. This book is a big deal.
Building on their own impressive accomplishments as designers, their
relentless intellectual curiosity, and a seemingly limitless connoisseurship of
analog and digital games, Geoff and Isaac have put together a tremendously
rigorous, wonderfully insightful, and astoundingly accessible encyclopedia of
the elements that make tabletop games tick.
Why is this project so important? As someone who has studied, designed,
and taught game design for 25 years, this volume is the sort of book I realize
now I always needed. A manual for game mechanics. A foundation for
structural analysis. An inspiration for new ideas. A sourcebook for teaching
design.
On its surface, Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design might seem like
a deeply geeky endeavor, an obsession with rules and structures. The kind of
overly formalist ludology that has (rightfully) gotten into so much trouble
in recent years. And in part it is. But look deeper. In games, what seems like
pure abstract structure is inseparable from human experience. Chapter 4,
on resolving game actions (those things players do to make meaning) begins
in statistics and the mathematics of randomness. But then it moves into the
thorny terrain of the prisoner’s dilemma, engaging with psychology and
diplomacy and even ethics—structures that help shape how people treat
one another.
Reading any one of the dozens of modules in this book is like lifting up
a big mossy rock in the forest. Underneath, there’s an unexpected universe
of complexity, a miniature ecosystem of moving parts, just waiting to be
discovered.
The language of games is everywhere.

Foreword

xv

All of this gushing praise is well deserved. This book is a landmark in the
study of games. But don’t let that fool you. As enchanting as it is, Building
Blocks of Tabletop Game Design is not a magic bullet that is going to suddenly
let you understand exactly how every game works, become a tournament
winner, or guarantee that your next design will be a hit.
The hidden grammars that this book describes, the structures behind the
structures, are only part of the picture. Building Blocks of Tabletop Game
Design doesn’t investigate how games tell stories, or impact the lives of their
players, or embody ideological values, or fit into larger cultural landscapes, or
even how they might make a profit. That’s just not what this book is about.
And that’s perfectly all right. Its titanic strength comes from its incredibly
tight focus on the fundamental elements of games.
Despite these limitations, is this book still useful? Hell yes. I was recently
trying to design a bidding structure for a game, and found myself jawdroppingly enlightened, reading Chapter 8 on Auctions, which details no
less than 16 distinct bidding structures. Without a doubt, I will use this text
in my classes. I am planning, for example, to assign a project by having each
student turn to two random pages in this book and then create a game that
combines both mechanics.
But there’s more. The insights and ideas in Building Blocks of Tabletop
Game Design can be applied outside of games.
How can we resolve an argument between two entrenched opposing
positions? How should a winner in a multicandidate election be determined?
What economic incentives lead to the best distribution of wealth? What’s the
right way to ensure fairness for all? These are dilemmas of modern society.
And they are also the kinds of problems with which game designers wrestle on
a daily basis. Believe it or not, the answers to these deeply important questions
might begin to be answered by looking at the structures within structures of
this book.
Lastly, games are beautiful.
Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want to leave you with the impression that this
book is valid only because it is useful. It doesn’t matter that Building Blocks
of Tabletop Games might be used to help teach classes, or even make society
better. This book is important because it is a heartfelt and soul-enriching love
letter to games.
It is a lens to help us see the games we adore with fresh eyes. An advanced
seminar in the complexity of systems. A spell book filled with recipes for

xvi

Foreword

creative play. Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design unpacks the mystery
of how these nerdy, knotty, collections of rules—boxed up with cards, dice,
and colorful tokens—produce something which is in fact the very opposite
of rules.
For those ready to appreciate the beauty of games, the joy leaps off of every
page. Isaac and Geoff have given us whole new ways to have conversations
with the people and the games we love.
Happy reading.

Thank you to Erik Zimmerman and Doug Maynard for your excellent
feedback and insightful comments on the manuscript. The readers thank
you even more! Rob Daviau, Tim Fowers, Mark Herman, and Sen-Foong
Lim provided key early enthusiastic support, without which we would not
have embarked on this project.
This work would also not exist if not for those who blazed this trail and
whose writings have shaped our thinking. Greg Costikyan’s I Have No
Words & I Must Design: Toward a Critical Vocabulary for Games (Tampere
University Press, 2002) was Isaac’s introduction to the world of critical
thought about games. Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
Software (Addison-Wesley, 1994) by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph
Johnson, and Richard Helm showed Geoff how design concepts could be
broken down and built back up again. Rules of Play (MIT Press, 2003) by
Katie Salen and Erik Zimmerman was another foundational text. We would
also like to recognize the books, lectures and blog posts by Jesse Schell, Bruno
Faidutti and Mark Rosewater, who continue to contribute to the growing
body of thinking about games and game design.
Daniel Solis created the delightful diagrams that illustrate each mechanism.
His ability to concisely capture complex concepts is uncanny, and this book
benefits greatly from his participation.

Introduction

ӶӶ

There is no better time to be a tabletop board gamer. Hobbyists will debate
whether the mid-1990s, which saw the rise of The Settlers of Catan and Magic:
The Gathering, was the golden age of gaming, or whether today is that golden
age. No matter what your personal view may be, there is no doubt that modern
tabletop gaming is in a period of exceptional fertility and is flourishing.
Games have come a long way since humans invented dice, pawns, and
boards, and archeologists regularly turn up these artifacts at sites dating back
6000+ years ago. The standard deck of cards has its beginnings over 1000
years ago, and with the advent of the printing press, games became an evercheaper and more ubiquitous luxury. The history of the last century or so of
games encompasses mass-market titles including Monopoly, Scrabble, Clue,
and Trivial Pursuit, as well as the emergence of a whole new genre of tabletop
games. The genre is so new that a single name has yet to meaningfully describe
it, though suggestions have included hobby games, designer games, and other,
stranger terms like TGOO (“these games of ours”). No matter what you
call them, today’s games feature higher levels of player agency, meaningful
decisions, and substantially improved production values, and offer something
entirely new to players, as compared to mass-market games.
Others have written about how war games developed into modern games
in America, and the countervailing rise of a European design sensibility in
the post-World War II period that rejected war as a setting, and direct conflict
as a game dynamic. Our goal here is different. We’d like to address not how
games evolved, but how games are designed.
Even as gaming itself has taken flight, and even as thousands of new
games are published each year to an ever-expanding audience of gamers, one
critical aspect of gaming remains in a nascent stage: the art and craft of game
design itself. Games have taken great advantage of modern communication
networks and methods to spread, but we encounter challenges in spreading the

xxi

xxii

Introduction

knowledge and skills needed to design these games. In substantial part this is
because we do not yet have a strong shared vocabulary for discussing design.
In creative industries, from literature to film to video games, practitioners,
participants, and critics develop a shared language, a common reference library,
and a set of skills, approaches, and techniques for their field. Film directors
learn the difference between a jump cut and a dolly zoom, and how different
technical approaches produce different effects. Audiences and critics follow along,
recognizing homages and allusions, and appreciating variations and innovations.
Tabletop game design is at a somewhat earlier stage, and this book is
our attempt to begin to build a broader game design vocabulary and body
of knowledge. Rather than attempting to formalize a specific game design
language—an approach that is both daunting and perhaps premature—we’ve
chosen to look at the building blocks of games themselves: the mechanisms
or, if you prefer, the mechanics, as they’re also frequently called by gamers.
(We’ll use the terms interchangeably through this book.)
The second-best piece of advice any new designer gets is to play more games.
(The first piece of advice, by the way, is to create a physical prototype as quickly
as possible.) Playing more games helps designers learn and grow by seeing, firsthand, a large variety of possible game experiences and mechanics. This is no
different than any other creative fields: every artist is enriched by experiencing
the art and craft of other creators. Yet games, like books, can take a long time to
experience, to master, and to fully appreciate, particularly for games that require
large player counts, have long play times, or demand many repeated plays.
In an effort to accelerate the learning process, we present this book, which
is a compendium of game mechanisms, grouped together thematically, that
map the territory of modern gaming. Our goal is not to give a list of steps or
instructions for how to design a game. To use a cooking metaphor, this is not
a recipe book, but rather a catalog of ingredients, and how they can enrich
a dish. We define close to two hundred different mechanisms and variants,
spanning topics like Movement, Game End and Victory, Economics, and more.
Within each topic, we discuss how different mechanisms create different player
experiences, what types of games these mechanisms give rise to, common pitfalls
in implementing them, and even some of the physical user-interface issues raised
by these mechanisms. With each mechanism, we present illustrative examples
and games for further study, running the gamut from modern classics to
contemporary new releases, as well as some lesser-known titles that nonetheless
have much to teach. A good resource for learning more about the included
examples is the website, BoardGameGeek.com, which contains a massive game
database featuring images and rulebooks that can assist in further inquiry.

Introduction

xxiii

Our hope is that this book serves many purposes. New designers can
certainly benefit from reading this book and taking in many mechanisms
in a short period of time, but this book can also be used as a reference.
Whether you’re an experienced designer looking for an overview of auctions,
for example, or a gamer interested in exploring the worker placement genre,
this book offers an easy way to review the topic and learn more. We feel this
book will be of use to educators, students, professional and amateur designers,
and anyone interested in reading about game design.
As important as what this book is, is what it is not: a comprehensive listing of
all game mechanisms. Though we strove to be broad and inclusive, an exhaustive
compilation of all game mechanisms was never our intention, and is arguably
impossible. While we do brush lightly on topics like narrative, dexterity, and
pantomime, for example, there remains a lot of unmapped terrain. Similarly,
while we do sometimes bring in examples from war gaming, miniatures gaming,
classic card games and collectible card games, we largely center ourselves on
modern board and card games. These lines are certainly artificial, and we have not
sought to put forward a definition of what games are in drawing the lines as we
did. Rather, we are eager to look to a future that continues to stretch, experiment
with and reconsider what games can be in light of new innovations in gaming.
We also do not mean to imply in any way that the well of new mechanisms
has run dry. The opportunity for innovation in gaming is limitless.
Our intention is to make it easier for designers to learn to design, to talk
with one another about design, and to mine the existing canon of board
games for insight into how to design better games. We hope this collection
is useful and inspirational to designers, and we look forward to playing the
next generation of their games.

Game Structure

ӶӶ
The first choice designers make about a game is the game’s basic structure.
Who wins? Who loses? What’s the overall scope of the game experience?
Will it be just one game, or perhaps a series of hands? Maybe the game will
encompass many scenarios, with game-state information persisting from play
to play? The last 20 years of tabletop gaming have brought us enormous
innovation in game structures, with no signs of slowing down.
Game structure raises the question of what it means to actually play the
game. In a cooperative game, is the discussion among the players over which
action to take the core of the gameplay, or is it the active player executing
the action that is core? In games which limit communication, is the main
gameplay overcoming the communication limits, or solving the puzzle the
game presents? Designers need to be sensitive to participation issues in team
games as well, because the game itself may force most of the action over to
one teammate at the expense of another.
In this chapter we’ll consider both the traditional structures like
competitive and team games, as well as the latest ideas in scenario-based,
legacy, and consumable games.

Competitive Games

Description
A game with two or more players and a single winner.

Discussion
This is the most familiar game structure, the one we encounter as children
in games like Candyland and Snakes & Ladders. Competitive games still
make up the large majority of the market for tabletop games. They typically
offer a symmetry of expectations: putting aside the impacts of unusual luck
and skill, each player begins the game with a roughly equivalent chance at
victory. When this promise is broken, the game is considered imbalanced,
and may even be tagged with the label “broken.” As we’ll discuss later (see
“Variable Player Powers” in this chapter and “Variable Setup” in Chapter 6),
players may have perfectly symmetric factions and starting conditions, or
highly asymmetric ones. But in both cases, it’s important that the game offers
roughly even chances of victory to each player.
In many games there is an asymmetry which in-game balancing alone
can’t solve, like the first-mover advantage in chess or the service advantage
in tennis. Competitive games often balance these advantages through metastructures, like tournaments, that offer each player an equal number of
chances to play from the advantaged position. In multiplayer games, this
may be less practical. Instead, players may be offered opportunities like the

Game Structure

bidding in bridge, betting in poker, or the early alliances in Diplomacy, to
balance any perceived or actual inequities.
The promise of balance in a competitive game gives rise to a number
of related issues, like methods for determining victory and breaking ties.
Tiebreaking, in particular, is interesting because determining a winner in a
competitive game depends upon the game storing information that allows
us to decide who played the better game. For many games, this information
may not be available. Once we have to look beyond who scored the most
victory points, or who crossed some finish line first, there may not be relevant
game-state information that could allow us to reasonably determine which
of the tied players played best. And yet, in competitive games, many players
disdain a game that ends in shared victory. Experience-oriented designers
should consider that players tend to recall how a game ended more than the
rest of the play experience, and designers should seek to avoid an indecisive
conclusion.

Cooperative Games

Description
Players coordinate their actions to achieve a common win condition or
conditions. Players all win or lose the game together.

Discussion
Quite a few games call for cooperative play among players, including team
games, one-vs.-many games, role-playing games, and games with secret
traitors. These can be viewed as belonging to a hierarchical category of
cooperative games. Some might even include solo games in this group. For our
purposes, we’ll treat each of these as separate categories, and limit ourselves
here to “pure” cooperative games in which all players play on one side and
win or lose as a group.
Since 2008, when Matt Leacock released Pandemic, the genre of cooperative tabletop games has exploded. Earlier games like Sherlock Holmes:
Consulting Detective, Arkham Horror and Lord of the Rings laid a foundation,
and enjoy enduring popularity, but Leacock started a wave of innovation in
cooperative gaming that continues to reshape modern gaming a decade and
more later.
Cooperative gaming is notable because it lowers barriers to entry for a
game. Disparities in skill level can often make a competitive game a sour
experience both for the expert and the newcomer. Complex competitive games
can be intimidating to new players, and being coached by your opponent

Game Structure

introduces some negative play dynamics because of the misaligned incentives
of helping your opponent. The power imbalance between the players can also
create awkward social dynamics. Cooperative games put players on the same
team and help create comradery while allowing experienced players to help
teach both the mechanics and strategy of the game without facing conflicting
incentives. For many new players, cooperative games are not only a gateway
into gaming, but a mainstay of their ongoing consumption of games.
Cooperative games can broadly be placed into two categories: those with
an artificial intelligence (AI) and those without. Cooperative games with an
AI, like Sentinels of the Multiverse and Mice and Mystics, feature an opponent
or opponents that players must contend against, whose behavior is governed
by some kind of simple artificial intelligence, encoded by the designer. In
Sentinels, the AI is driven by a deck of cards that governs the actions of the
enemy villains and the players they will target. Mice has a simple algorithm
that players use to control the play of enemy figures.
Non-AI games like Hanabi, the revolutionary Antoine Bauza title, and
Mysterium, present players with a puzzle to solve, and some kind of limitations
of time, resources, and interaction that players must contend with. However,
these games have no villain or opposing force that drives the action and
actively confronts the players.
Another distinction between different kinds of cooperative games is
whether each player retains agency over their in-game resources, actions
and choices, or whether they seek consensus for all decisions, even if they
nominally represent separate in-game characters. We might call the former
game a partnership game, and the latter a collaborative one. In general,
cooperative games will tend to be played collaboratively unless the rules
specifically and substantially impede this collaboration and force players to
make independent decisions rather than build consensus. Examples include
limits on communications, time, and focus.
For some players, collaborative play contributes to the “alpha player
problem,” also known as “quarterbacking,” in which some player takes
control of the group discussion and decision-making and creates a negative
play experience by overriding other players. There are many possible reasons
for the rise of an alpha player problem, many ways that problem can manifest,
and a thicket of contributory social dynamics that are beyond the scope of this
work. While some players and designers believe that the alpha player problem
is a group-composition problem, or a problem of unshared assumptions,
rather than a design problem, some design choices will make a game more
vulnerable to alpha player takeovers. In particular, when all players share the

6

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

same information, and the game state is not too complex, the tendency is for
alpha player behavior to arise.
At the other end of the spectrum are games which cannot be taken over by
an alpha player. Magic Maze and others of its type make player communication
a game mechanism, such that players can’t freely share information or advise
one another on how to play. The Mind takes this to an extreme by forbidding
players from having any kind of communication about which cards they hold.
These types of communication limitations may be presented like any other
rule, but they don’t actually create a bright line of which conduct is and is not
permitted. Rather, these games can be played somewhat differently by each
group, with the precise contours of allowable communication varying by tacit
or overt agreement. This approach is deeply polarizing, and some players will
utterly reject these kinds of games or cast doubt on whether they are games
at all. That said, these communication restrictions have the potential to create
incredible experiences that connect participants to one another on an almost
mystical level.
Communication limitations are only one approach to preventing players
from achieving consensus-based play. Space Cadets, Space Alert, and FUSE
introduce a real-time element that forces players to make independent
decisions because there is no time for players to collaborate. Other games
attempt to strongly connect players to their roles, provide them with hidden
information, or make operating their roles especially complicated. Mechs vs.
Minions and Spirit Island both make it challenging for players to decipher
each other’s powers and possibilities. Sentinels of the Multiverse attempts
something similar by providing each player with a unique preconstructed
deck. Escape room games from T.I.M.E Stories to the Exit and Unlock series
sometimes bar players from sharing information too specifically as well. The
variety of challenges and puzzles these games offer, and even the various roles
that players can take in the solving effort, all help ensure that every player
finds a satisfying way to participate in the game.
Another notable trend in co-op game design is the conversion of onevs.-many, “overlord”-style games into co-ops with the assistance of an app.
Mansions of Madness: Second Edition and Star Wars: Imperial Assault both
introduced apps that allow the games to be played cooperatively. More
generally, games are being released with cooperative and solo modes alongside
competitive modes of play. Sometimes, as has been the case with Orleans and
Oh My Goods!, cooperative modes have been introduced in expansions to
competitive games.

Team-Based Games

G
m
ase

Description
In team-based games, teams of players compete with one another to obtain
victory. There are a variety of possible team structures, including symmetrical
teams like 2v2 and 3v3, multiple sides like 2v2v2, and even One vs. All.

Discussion
Team-based play is an ancient human pastime and is prevalent in sports, classic
card games, and war games. Thematic board games that model some conflict
often have to deal with a bilateral narrative, whether in the conflict of good
versus evil like in War of the Ring, the eponymous conflict of Axis & Allies, or

Game Structure

9

the entirely fabricated battle between villagers and their lycanthropic tormentors
in Werewolf. Team games allow designers to faithfully recreate these two-sided
conflicts while making space for more players at the table.
Most team games assign players to one team or another at the outset and
allow collaboration and communication among partners. In some cases,
partners may share territory and resources, or even move each other’s pieces
around the board. Early editions of Axis & Allies, for example, featured
Commander-in-Chief rules to model the historical reality of coordinating
attacks by multinational armies.
Assigning players to teams in secret is a common trope in social deduction
and betrayal-style games. In Werewolf, the werewolves know one another, but
the villagers are left to deduce who is a fellow human and who might devour
them in the night. In Battlestar Galactica, neither humans nor Cylons are
revealed to one another, leading to intense suspicion and paranoia. Battlestar
Galactica features a further twist: team assignments are not static, and a
player might start the game as a human, only to become a Cylon in a midgame loyalty phase that can potentially reassign players from the human to
the Cylon side.
Some games support partnering at the meta-game level. In Risk, Diplomacy,
and many other games, the rules specify that alliances can be formed and
broken freely. There are even games that further encode these alliances into
the rules. Dune provides for different end-game conditions for alliances with
different numbers of factions, includes a specific phase when alliances may
be formed, and has rules governing the conduct of allies (e.g., they may not
attack each other). Eclipse establishes economic advantages for allying with
other players, while limiting the number of these allegiances, and enforcing
in-game penalties on betrayers. There is a great deal of fluidity between games
that allow for coordination in play and those that have explicit mechanisms
to support that coordination.
Another common approach to team-based games is that in which players
perform different roles in the game. This goes well beyond the distinct
player abilities common to many co-op games. Party games from Celebrity
to Taboo to Codenames feature one player in a clue-giving role, with one or
more teammates in a guessing role. This structure is especially suitable for
party games because of the concurrent play of the guessers, and the ability
for the game structure to support large numbers of players at any one time.
It also allows players to easily enter and exit from a game without negatively
impacting the overall play experience for other players.

10

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

It’s not just party games that embrace role separation, though. Space Cadets:
Dice Duel and Captain Sonar both use the setting of operating some kind
of ship to cast players as engineers, radar operators, captains, and weapons
specialists. Each player plays a mini-game to model their function within the
ship, and the broader game is the sum of these coordinated parts. Sometimes
these roles can be fixed for the whole game, sometimes players will rotate
through the roles every round, and sometimes the game itself will force
players to change roles. This last approach can be thematically interesting
and appealing to experienced players, but can be especially challenging for
new players, who can easily be disoriented when forced to change roles. It
also makes teaching these games much more difficult, since, in theory, every
player needs to know every mini-game before play can begin. Designers need
to take this into account, perhaps by reserving role-changing cards and other
triggers for advanced play only.
Somewhat less common are team games with more than two teams
competing at once. Skirmish games like Star Wars: X-Wing can allow for
these types of modes, but there are even more unusual examples. Cyclades
with the Titans expansion enables a 2v2v2 mode, and Ticket to Ride: Asia also
supports 2v2v2 play.
Team modes are fairly common in otherwise non-team games, and some
team modes are attempts to enable a 1v1 game to scale to a higher player
count. The aforementioned Axis & Allies and War of the Ring have team
modes, but players may simply choose to play using the 1v1 rules, and have
teammates collaborate in decision-making instead of using the formal rules
for team play.
Two other game genres feature partnerships. Card games, especially those
in the trick-taking family, are one. The other partnership genre is dexterity
games. Flick ‘em Up has explicit partnership rules, and many flicking games
like PitchCar and Caveman Curling are amenable to alternating play.
Another very popular game structure is One vs. All. This structure is
especially suitable for hidden-movement hunting games, in which one player
attempts to escape from a group of hunters, like Scotland Yard, Specter Ops,
and Hunt for the Ring. It’s also common in overlord-style games where one
player controls the “bad guys” and the other players each control an individual
hero. Conan, Star Wars: Imperial Assault, and Level 7 [Omega Protocol] all
feature this style of play. Fantasy Flight Games has converted many of its
overlord games into cooperative games by introducing an app to control the
overlord player.

Game Structure

11

What distinguishes One vs. All most sharply from other team games is the
asymmetric nature of the factions. In hunting games, each player typically
controls only one character, but the characters tend to have very distinct
abilities, and the victory conditions for the two sides are different too. In
overlord games, the overlord usually controls a whole host of minions that they
can deploy, whereas the other players control only one character. These games
can be difficult to teach and learn because players need to learn how both
factions work in order to play the game effectively. While the genre remains
very popular, that challenge continues to bedevil designers and players.

Solo Games

Description
A solo game is a game or game mode intended for play by a single player.

Discussion
Solo games can stretch the definition of what a game is, but solo games have
been around for some time. Patience or Solitaire card games, war games,
interactive fiction (e.g., Choose Your Own Adventure books), crossword
puzzles, paper-and-pencil games, word searches and many more single-player,
game-like pursuits are very popular and have been for years. What is new is the
explosion of demand, and supply, for solo board games, whether as standalone
games or as game modes in multiplayer games. Rather than quibbling over the
definition, we choose to embrace the variety and possibilities of solo gaming.
Solo games are closely related to cooperative games in the sense that the
player plays against the game system itself, rather than a sentient opponent.
Solo games can be considered as a special case of co-op games in which there
is only one player—and thus, no alpha player problem. While most co-ops
can be, and are, played solo, communications-based co-op games like The
Mind typically can’t be played solo at all. Cooperative Limited Card Games
(LCGs—a genre, i.e., a blend of collectible card games and deck-building
games) are very popular among solo players, and the dungeon-crawl-style
Rogue-like game seems especially amenable to solo play. Players can usually
brew their own unofficial solo game from these games, or from many noncommunication-based co-ops, by playing more than one position in a co-op
game, for example.
Modern solo design pushes beyond that basic approach to solo play. We can
classify a few kinds of solo games: goal-based, record-based, and AI-based. In
goal-based games, players try to achieve some goal, usually a Victory Point
(VP) total, within a certain number of turns, or a certain amount of time.

Game Structure

13

This type of design is most similar to multiplayer cooperative games. These
games might have an AI opponent of sorts, but typically the opponent is an
asymmetric villain of some kind, or even an entirely abstract process, like a
spreading fire in Flash Point: Fire Rescue. The AI is not an automated version
of a human player who competes as another human player might.
Record-based games are those whose goal is to beat your previous high
score. While this may seem like a mundane and dull victory condition,
some games have developed large solitaire followings, complete with ladders
and statistics that transform the game from a solo game to a communitybased meta-competition. Ganz schön clever is one example of this type of
game and community competition. Some goal-based games can also work
as record-based games, as long as some scoring metric can be captured that
adequately measures game performance.
AI-based games attempt to recreate the multiplayer experience by
introducing an automated player or players. Typically, this means some basic
algorithm governs the moves of the AI player. These systems can be challenging
to design, and usually depend on dice, cards or other randomizers to create
uncertainty about the AI player’s choices. However, other approaches to AI
opponents are also possible, as shown by Morten Monrad Pederson’s Automa
system, which powers solo modes in games as varied as Scythe, Anachrony,
Baseball Highlights 2045, and Between Two Cities.
Pederson’s Automa system is more a philosophy and approach than an
official system, and many designers have used its principles to create Automas.
The key principles are that the solo game should feel as much as possible like
the multiplayer game, and that AIs should be representational, rather than
procedural. The AI doesn’t observe the rules and doesn’t play the game as a
player might. Rather, the AI is a series of outputs that are applied to the game
state that mimic the outputs that result from a human player’s choices—a
kind of Potemkin player. In Pederson’s words, the AI is only the shell of a
human player, and while the humans in a game of Viticulture have vineyards
and grow grapes, the Automa players do not; they just give the impression
that they do. In practice, Automas will claim action spaces, draft cards, block
routes, and otherwise interfere with human players, but they will not collect
resources, build buildings, or score victory points.
Solo games are enjoyed by a large, active, and growing community who
continues to homebrew solo versions of multiplayer games, host contests and
challenges, and enjoy an unexpected comradery despite the solitary nature
of their pastime. Increasingly, including a solo mode is a desirable feature for
published multiplayer games, and the success of a number of solo-only games,

like Friday and Hostage Negotiator, has established that there is a market even
for the loneliest of player counts.

Semi-Cooperative Games

Description
A game which ends with either no winners or with the players winning as a
group, but a single player being recognized as the individual winner as well.

Discussion
Semi-cooperative games are like cooperative games because players can all lose
together to the game itself. However, if the players manage to overcome the
game, one of the players will be crowned the individual victor, or a kind of
most valuable player, based on some in-game achievement. A group’s enjoyment
of this style of game depends on all members having the same answer to the
question of whether a group win, coupled with an individual loss, is in fact
superior to a total group loss. If players are split on this question, those for whom
an individual loss is as bad as a group loss will not seek optimal cooperative plays,
and may even sabotage the group while trying to secure a winning individual
position. Players who prefer to win as a group, even if they lose as individuals,
will be incensed by this conduct, and unhappiness will follow for everyone.
There’s a strong connection between semi-cooperative games and roleplaying games (RPGs). RPGs typically feature a similar dynamic: all players
want to follow the main plot narrative and defeat the big bad, but each player
has individual motivations that may sometimes work at cross-purposes,
and in any case, each player is motivated to secure the greatest in-game
rewards in terms of wealth, experience points, glory, etc. These competing
motivations can help weave a complex and gripping narrative. In tabletop

16

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

games, a semi-cooperative structure can create memorable moments of lastsecond betrayal and competitive jockeying for position.
Semi-cooperative games are fascinating as a design study because of
how players engage with them. Many groups will play semi-cooperatives as
co-ops, ignoring the individual win conditions, or treating them as a means
for recognizing a great performance by some player, rather than as a win
condition to be claimed. Others will embrace the notion of an individual
win and engage in brinksmanship in almost total violation of the cooperative
element of the game. Despite the broad range of possible play styles, each
group typically has a very narrow idea of the “right way” to play the game. In
other words, it’s unlikely that the same group would play Arkham Horror as a
total co-op one night, and then as a semi-co-op another night. Actually, you
might be hard-pressed to find anyone who plays Arkham Horror with any care
for the individual win condition. The game holds little attraction for players
looking for that experience. Crafting a semi-co-op that is satisfying to play
and that manages to incentivize both the individual and cooperative aspects
of the game is like trying to land a jet plane in a phone booth.
Another route a designer can consider is introducing cooperative elements
into a competitive game without creating a cooperative loss condition. Games
like Kingsburg and Survive: Escape from Atlantis achieve this in different ways.
In Kingsburg, all players must face a common foe at the end of each year.
In Survive, players can share common resources like lifeboats to escape the
ocean’s dangers. These cooperative opportunities can enrich the game and
create internal drama without confusing players as to their incentives, or
causing distress over what type of game players they thought they sat down to.

Single Loser Games

Description
A game with three or more players which ends with only one loser.

Discussion
Games with one loser flip the script by incentivizing players not to perform
better than everyone else, but better than at least one other person. Like the
old saw about not needing to outrun a ravenous bear, these games emphasize
impeding other players more than advancing yourself. Old Maid is a wellknown classic card with this structure. Alcatraz: The Scapegoat is a modern
game in which players are escaping prison, but one of them, the scapegoat,
will remain behind and lose.
Stacking games often feature a single-loser structure, because many of
them end when a player knocks over the shared structure. Jenga and Rhino
Hero are examples of this dynamic, though Rhino Hero does offer some rules
for determining who the winner is among the surviving players. In practice
though, groups often ignore this final scoring, or even scoring of any kind.
Single-loser structures are not very common in modern games, perhaps
because they encourage sharply confrontational “take-that” play in which
players can directly impede or harm one another. These structures can also be
susceptible to a bash-the-loser pattern, in which the player who falls behind
becomes the most attractive target to all other players, and has no chance to
recover their position. This structure represents an innovation horizon for
designers to explore.

Traitor Games

Description
A traitor game can be seen as a kind of team game, or as a cooperative game
with a betrayal mechanism. The traitors typically win by triggering a failure
condition for the players. For our purposes, a traitor game is characterized by
traitors that begin the game with hidden identities.

Discussion
Traitor games sit at the overlap in the Venn diagram of social deduction
games, team games, and cooperative games. The cooperative game engine sets
the overall parameters for how players interact in the game, and those choices
provide information that players can use and manipulate to deduce, accuse,
and mislead. The team element provides coordination options for both sides,
both out loud and in secret. These designs must add a layer of obfuscation in
order to preserve uncertainty and mystery. Thus, in Dead of Winter the cards
contributed by players to meeting the current crisis are shuffled prior to being
revealed, so as to hide which player contributed which card.
In designing traitor games, it’s important to consider how the game plays at
different stages of knowing the traitor’s identity. The tension and suspense of
not knowing who is on which side is great fuel for the beginning of the game,
but once the traitor has been sussed out, is the game still fun? Does the traitor
still have meaningful and interesting choices? Is catching the traitor a victory

20

condition itself? Betrayal at House on the Hill is a traitor game with many story
modules, each with its own mechanisms, that designers can treat it as a case
study on this exact issue.
Another challenge facing traitor games is learnability. Like in team or One
vs. All games, players have to learn how all the sides work to play properly.
In traitor games with hidden identities, players can’t readily ask questions or
consult the rules without giving away their loyalties. Good player aids and
reference material need to be areas of focus.

Scenario/Mission/Campaign Games

Description
This is a game system that can be applied to a variety of different maps,
starting resources and positions, and even different win and loss conditions.
These variable conditions can be assembled into a broader narrative or
campaign, or they can be entirely disconnected from one another.

Discussion
The roots of scenario-based games are in storytelling, history, wargames
and RPGs. The idea is that a rich experience can be woven out of multiple
episodes, planned out to be experienced sequentially.
In wargames like Advanced Squad Leader, the same core system, together
with substantial supplements, enables players to model an enormous variety of
possible conflicts. As players gain mastery, they can attempt more challenging
and complex scenarios. At the other end of the spectrum, a war-themed game
like Memoir ’44 gives players the opportunity to play the many battles and
confrontations that made up the D-Day invasion with an intuitive ruleset that
can be taught in ten minutes.

22

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Scenario structures are popular in dungeon crawler games. Swap in a new
dungeon map, a new boss monster, maybe some new mission types, and
players can enjoy new challenges without learning new rules. Scenarios can
also be completely detached from any narrative, and simply allow players to
face off against one another in a skirmish mode that provides some basic rules
for force construction. Scenarios are also prevalent in cooperative settings,
both for offering different levels of difficulty and for creating variety.
Recently, there has been an explosion in the types of games offering a
scenario or campaign structure. Catan expansions going back as far as Seafarers
of Catan have offered scenario play, but hits like The 7th Continent, Mechs
vs. Minions, Near and Far, and card-based dungeon crawlers like Pathfinder
Adventure Card Game and Gloomhaven have rocketed in popularity. It’s also
impossible not to mention T.I.M.E Stories and the various escape room game
series like Exit: The Game, Unlock!, and Deckscape. Though each box is a
self-contained experience, the play system is largely similar from box to box,
and outside of the packaging and business model, these games are scenariobased in structure. One might even consider Age of Steam maps, Power Grid
expansions, Ticket to Ride standalone variants from Europe to New York,
Pandemic: Iberia and Cthullhu, and the Mystery Rummy series as follow-on
scenarios, sold separately.

Score-and-Reset Games

Description
This is a game in which players play until reaching a stopping condition, then
record scores, reset the game, and play one or more additional rounds. The
game concludes after some number of rounds, and the cumulative score is
calculated to determine a winner.

Discussion
Score-and-reset is a very common game structure that is well represented
among classic games from Bridge to Backgammon, and in modern games like
Red7, Ravenous River, and Incan Gold.
Card games are especially amenable to this structure, which matches well
with playing out a hand of cards, shuffling and redealing. Games with a
strong turn-order advantage can take advantage of a score-and-reset structure
by having players take turns in the lead position, and using cumulative scoring
to measure who played best over a series of rounds.
Stacking games like Rhino Hero use score-and-reset because once the
shared structure is toppled, there’s a need to collect up the cards and pieces
anyway, and this represents a natural end point. Whether players do in fact

24

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

record wins and losses or points is to some extent a matter of the dynamics of
the game group itself. By contrast, dexterity games like KLASK and BONK
reset after each goal, but scoring is rigorously tracked.
Score-and-reset structures can be somewhat informal. Players might play
a series of games of Hive and declare a victor after one player reaches some
total number of victories. There’s not a sharp line between score-and-reset and
round structure in general. Amun-Re features two ages, in which gameplay is
identical, but the board itself does not fully reset. Pyramids built in the first
age persist in the second age, and influence valuation of territories. In Blue
Lagoon, the board is reset between the first and second half of the game, with
the exception of the huts players lay out in the first half. However, the rules
of placement change profoundly too—where players were free to lay explorers
on any sea space in the first half, in the second half, they must begin laying
explorers adjacent to their huts.

Legacy Games

m
ase

Description
A legacy game is a multisession game in which permanent and irreversible
changes to the game state carry over from session to session.

Discussion
The first legacy game, Rob Daviau’s Risk Legacy, came from the unlikeliest
of places: Hasbro. Daviau, by his telling, half-shepherded, half-snuck the
audacious design past the gatekeepers at the company, and emerged with a
genre-defining hit. Famously, the game was sealed with a sticker that had to
be broken to open the box, and which warned ominously, “What is Done
Cannot Be Undone.” This irreversible permanent change is what legacy games
are all about.
As of this writing, there are still relatively few legacy games on the market.
They are difficult to playtest, require generating quite a lot of content, and

26

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

are tricky to produce and price properly. Curmudgeons will rightly point out
that RPGs and campaign games are essentially legacy games, except that you
don’t have to destroy your game as you play. Yet that permanent destruction,
the tearing of a card or writing on a board generates a visceral response that
those other games don’t. Breaking this taboo and permanently altering a game
can be a stressful and cathartic experience at the same time.
Legacy games aren’t simply about destroying components and defacing
boards. Another element common to these games is unlocks: gated content
that can only be opened and accessed after some condition is met. We’ll
refrain from specific examples, so as not to spoil these experiences for the
uninitiated! Unlocks differ fundamentally from gated content in non-legacy
games (see “Gating and Unlocking” in Chapter 3) in that unlocks usually
occur at game-end, their impacts will only be felt in the next session, and
these unlocks are typically not simply buffs and de-buffs to existing statistics,
but rather, entire new mechanisms, characters, factions, maps, etc. These
unlocks can also radically change the narrative or move the camera and offer
players new perspective and surprises.
Like campaign games, legacy games require a substantial commitment to
complete, and they typically call for the same group to come together ten or
more times. Pandemic Legacy can theoretically take 24 sessions to complete!
Publishers, and thus designers, can feel trapped between offering a novel and
essentially unrepeatable experience on the one hand, while still providing
sufficient re-playability to players, despite the consumable nature of the game.
Most legacy games do allow players to keep playing the game even after the
campaign is concluded, but anecdotally, it seems that few players do so.
It appears, from this early vantage point on this emerging trend, that the
market is expanding to allow for a broader range of possible games, such that
at the right price point, even a single-play game like the Exit series can be a hit.
Games like the Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle deck-building game have used
unlocks, but not destructibility, and are fully resettable. Gloomhaven takes a
similar approach with reusable stickers to provide changes that are campaignpermanent, but otherwise reversible. Fabled Fruit is even more easily reset,
requiring nothing more than reordering a deck of cards. However, it is difficult
to distinguish it structurally from, say, a deck-building game in which any
given play session may include a completely different subset of cards.
Legacy games are a still-emerging category and definition. Elements we’ve
identified may not exist in every game, and new elements may yet emerge,
especially as legacy games and digital apps converge. Stay tuned for more
changes in this exciting new genre.

Turn Order and Structure

ӶӶ
One of the elements that separates “games” from “play” is the introduction
of structure. This takes many forms, including restrictions on how players
perform activities and when they may perform them. Out of this arises the
concept of a “turn”—an order or structure within which players take their
actions.
The concept of taking turns is one of the first game-based concepts taught
to young children. Many simple games, like Candyland, exist for the purpose
of teaching how to wait for your turn, among other early building blocks of
how to play games.
The turn structure of a game can set the tone for the entire experience,
whether it is playful, strategic, or intense. Selecting the appropriate turn
structure for the game is an important part of the design process.
This section includes a wide variety of these structures, including some
that, while appearing unstructured, like real-time games, actually contain
their own internal structure, logic, and design challenges.

29

30

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Terminology
For this book we have adopted the following commonly used terminology
when describing turn structure:
A Turn is typically one player taking a series of Actions or Steps, although
sometimes other players may interrupt or otherwise participate.
A Round is composed of multiple Turns. This can be a fixed number of
turns, or variable depending on player actions or random events.

For example, Agricola consists of 14 Rounds. In each Round there is a Start
Player, who takes the first Turn. During that Turn, they perform two Steps:
Placing a worker, and performing the Actions designated by the space where
the worker is placed. Players continue to take Turns in clockwise order until
all workers have been placed. This concludes the Round.
There may be activities that take place at the beginning or end of a Round.
For example, in Agricola you may need to feed your workers, or new Actions
may be added to the available options.
Many games also introduce the concept of a Phase. Phases can be inserted
at different places in the hierarchy depending on the needs of the designer.
For example, a Round can consist of several Phases, and each Phase can have

Turn Order and Structure

31

a series of Turns. Or a series of Rounds may make up a Phase. The section on
Interleaved vs. Sequential Structures (TRN-15) discusses this in more detail.
The key distinguishing feature of Phases vs. Rounds or Turns is that there
are usually multiple Phases, and each is named with a different and specific
purpose. For example, there may be a “Feeding Phase” and a “Scoring Phase,”
and those can be radically different from each other. In contrast, Rounds
and Turns are rarely distinguished in this way. They are identical in their
basic structure. This is not to say that each Turn, for example, always consists
of exactly the same Steps. Many games give players a choice of actions to
perform. But a turn performed by one player is typically very similar in
structure, if not identical, to another player’s turn.
Some games also have levels above Rounds. These have a variety of names,
from the generic Stage in Die Speicherstadt to the more thematic Age in
Through the Ages.
Obviously, all of this terminology is not written in stone, and there will be
esoteric structures that may require different names. However, anything that is
outside what players are expecting, or inverting this customary order, will add
cognitive load to the players, both in learning and playing. You can build a car
that puts the windshield wiper controls underneath the radio instead of on a
steering wheel stalk, or make a new icon to represent the defrosters, but new
drivers will find it more challenging to drive. Eventually they will adapt, but the
best approach is to keep to conventions unless there is a strong reason not to do so.

Fixed Turn Order

Description
Turn order is set at the start of the game and never varies. Each player takes
a turn in the same sequence until the end of the game.

Discussion
A Fixed Turn Order is the most basic turn order, one that we are introduced
to from the first games we play at a young age. Typically, play proceeds
from a starting player clockwise around the table; however, Asian games
often proceed counter-clockwise. In this book we will assume that games
proceed clockwise (Progressive or Become First Player Action, for example).
We recommend that the direction match the cultural norm to reduce the
cognitive load on players.
Fixed Turn Order will often result in an imbalance favoring one of
the player positions (typically the first player, but sometimes the last). To
compensate, the designer may give a bonus to the other players. This can be
extra or better resources, as in Century: Spice Road, bonus victory points, as
in Go, or other advantages.
Another concern is ensuring players will have an equal number of turns.
A common means for addressing this is using a token or indication of which
player went first. When the game-ending condition is triggered, the round
continues, the marker serving as a reminder of which players should still take
a turn so that all players will have the same number of turns. Century: Spice
Road uses this system, for example.
These systems may introduce additional complexity and design
considerations, however. For example, some players may have their final turn
before they know that the game is ending, while others may have theirs after,
and be able to optimize their play. Let’s say there are five players: A through
E, with A being the first player. If player C triggers the end of the game,

Turn Order and Structure

33

D and E will get one final turn, then the game will end. This may give D
and E an advantage over A and B, as they definitely know this is their final
turn and can execute accordingly.
Through the Ages uses a Fixed Turn structure, and keeps track of the first
player. However, to help counteract the issue that some but not all players
know what their last turn is, it sometimes extends an extra round, depending
on when the end is triggered. If game-end is triggered on the first player’s
turn, the current round would be the final round. If game-end is triggered on
any other player’s turn, the game goes on for another full round. This helps
mitigate the situation, but it does add additional complexity to the rules.

Stat Turn Order

Description
The turn order within each Round is set by some statistic relating to the
players’ resources or position in the game.

Discussion
This Stat Turn Order mechanism gives the designer an additional tool to work
with, particularly to implement a Catch the Leader mechanism (VIC-18).
Frequently the resource that is used as the basis for turn order is Victory Points
(VIC-01), where the player in last place goes first in the turn order, or possibly
last. However, it can be other resources or board states. In Civilization, for
example, it is based on the number of population tokens a player has on
the board.
Turn order may also be variable for different phases of the game, based on
different statistics. Both Power Grid and Civilization use this method. Power
Grid always uses the number of connected cities as the ranking metric, but
in some phases the player with the most connected cities goes first, and in
others they go last. During the auction for power plants, the player in the
lead must select and bid on the first power plant, which is disadvantageous.
When purchasing resources and building power lines, the player in the lead
goes last, resulting in more expensive resources or possibly getting blocked
out of places to build. In Civilization, some phases are sequenced by Census
(population tokens), while others are based on the victory track, either forward
or reverse. This gives the designer fine-grained control over balance and the
relative importance of different aspects. It also allows players to manipulate
turn order, and gives the designer a tool to implement a Catch the Leader
mechanism.
A word of caution is in order if Victory Points are used as the turn order (as
in Power Grid), but many Victory Points are awarded at the end of the game,

Turn Order and Structure

35

or are otherwise not tallied on the Victory Point (VP) track immediately
(VIC-06). Those “off-the-book” VPs have the added benefit of not hurting
a player’s turn order positioning. If players who are ahead on the score track
during the game are penalized by turn order, it will give increased weight to
strategies around end-game points, which the designer needs to consider for
balance.
When the advantages of turn order are extreme, manipulating turn order
may become a dominant feature of game play, which may or may not match
the designer’s intent. For example, in Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, a
simulation of the European theater of World War II, turn order is determined
by the production output of the sides (called Basic Resource Points, or BRPs).
Typically, it is clear which side has more BRPs, and the turn order stays fixed.
However, at critical points the lead may change, resulting in a double turn,
as the player that moved last in one turn moves first in the next. Players have
some control over BRPs, as a portion of those not spent carry over to the next
turn, and conquests, strategic warfare, and other effects may impact it, so
paying close attention to this stat is vital.
This is clearly part of the design intent. In the early stages of the game,
Germany will typically move first, but as the United States enters the war and
gains in economic strength there will inevitably be a transition resulting in
Allied double move, which can strongly shift momentum in their favor. The
Axis player tries to blunt this by controlling the timing of when this double
move occurs, perhaps triggering it earlier than the Allied player wants, and
when they are not set up to take advantage of it.

Bid Turn Order

Description
Players bid for turn order. A variety of auction mechanisms may be used
(see “Auctions” in Chapter 8 for more details).

Discussion
Adding an auction for turn order, or Bid Turn Order, helps improve balance
by allowing the players to decide the relative merits of different turn orders at
different times and situations. However, there are several drawbacks to this
method. First, it will slow the game down. Auctions in general can add a lot
of time to the game and can feel tacked-on when the auction is not integrated
into the core game mechanism. This is normally the case with auctioning off
turn order, which is usually a prelude to the main gameplay.
Age of Steam has a traditional Turn Order Until Pass auction (AUC-03).
While the auction can be long, turn order in this game is very important,
and the rules of the bid have additional tactical considerations, since players
who drop out early get all or some of their bids back. In a tight economic
game like Age of Steam, the bidding is extremely tense and important, and the
experience more than makes up for the game length.
In A Game of Thrones, players bid for turn order via the Throne track. In
addition to being first player, the highest bidder on the Throne track also gains
the ability to break any ties that occur. Giving an extra benefit to the auction
makes it more interesting to the players, and raises the stakes of the bidding.
Another game that uses this mechanism is El Grande, where the playing
of Power Cards determines the turn order. Each player has Power Cards
numbered 1–20, and selects one (selection is made based on the turn order of
the prior turn). Each player may only play each Power Card once per game,
and they may not play the same Power Card as one that another player has
played during that round. These rules speed the auction for turn order. In an

Turn Order and Structure

37

example of elegant design, the Power Cards determine not just turn order, but
the number of pieces (“caballeros”) that are made available to the player for
the Area Majority competition (ARC-02) featured in the game. Power cards
are designed to offer better turn order and fewer caballeros, or vice versa.
Timing their play is a critical part of El Grande and makes the turn-order
auction step more engaging.
Auctions do suffer from another weakness, though. Auctions rely on
players understanding the value of what they are bidding on. When bidding
for resources or something tangible, it is easier for new players to judge relative
worth. However, turn order is a much more nebulous concept for new players,
and determining its value can be very tricky. This can lead to players over- or
under-paying in the auction, which can lead to balance issues and lessened
enjoyment. Therefore, if using a bid for turn order, it is recommended that
designers give players guidelines for typical early game bids to help them bid
appropriately.
Bid Order turn systems typically require a physical element to track turn
order—a track, tokens, cards, something to indicate the sequence. Because
turn order does not go “around the table,” this system can result in delays as
players get confused, or need to check a secondary track, to determine whose
turn it is.

Progressive Turn Order

Description

One player has the First Player token. At the end of the round, the token
passes to the player to the left who becomes the new First Player for that
round. During the round, players take turns clockwise around the table.

Discussion
There are several advantages to the Progressive Turn Order system over the Fixed
Turn Order (TRN-01) structure. First, it naturally rotates the first player marker
through the players in a predictable way. This enables planning on the part of the
players, plus it introduces a timing element. If you are going second, you know
that you will be going first the next round and can plan accordingly.
Similarly, being first in a round is immediately followed by being last in the
next round. This gives a nice rhythm to the game, as over a series of rounds
you move closer and closer to going first, and then slip to last place. It’s a
gradual buildup, followed by a sharp drop.
The above assumes, of course, that going first is the best position, and going
last the worst. In some games the opposite is true, like Texas Hold’Em Poker.
In this game the first position is typically considered the worst, while the last,
“the button,” is the best, as seeing what other players do before you make your
decision gives more information to work with. So in Texas Hold’Em Poker,
once the player is in the best position, the button, they gradually move closer
and closer to the worst position, the small blind. Then the player jumps from
being in the worst position to the best.

Turn Order and Structure

39

Progressive games can leave a large gap between player turns. For example,
in a five-player game when a player moves first, the next round he or she will
move fifth. That means that it will be nine turns until the player gets to go
again (eight opponent turns). Depending on the game, this can lead to serious
downtime. For this reason, Progressive is most effective in games with short
turns, or where players take actions during other player turns. The latter is
done in Puerto Rico, where the other players get to perform a less powerful
version of the action selected by the main player (ACT-08).
Typically, games that use Progressive Turn structure are played to the end of
the round in which the end game condition is triggered. Therefore, the issue with
players having an unequal number of turns does not arise as it does in Fixed Turn
Order games. Sometimes a mechanism is included to ensure that each player has
the same number of opportunities to go first (often by setting the number of
rounds equal to the number of players, or a multiple of that number).
A less-used variant on Progressive Turn structure is Regressive, where the
First Player token passes counter-clockwise, while turns are taken clockwise.
Much of the discussion in Progressive applies here, in terms of psychology
and gaps between turns. However, there is one important difference: in a
Regressive structure, the player who goes last in one round will go first in the
next. Players having two turns in a row can be extremely powerful, particularly
when a player knows it is happening and can plan accordingly. The game
needs to be designed and structured to either take advantage of that or blunt it
in some fashion. For example, in Dead of Winter, a semi-cooperative potential
hidden traitor game (STR-05), the hidden traitors would do well to reveal
themselves to be the traitors in the round in which they go last, as they will
have two successive turns in which to wreak havoc.
Regressive is unintuitive to players, because so many games go clockwise.
Having a turn which moves clockwise, but a token which moves counterclockwise, is an additional cognitive burden that should only be imposed for
some specific design reason.

The Little Prince: Make Me a Planet (Bauza and Cathala, 2013)

Claim Turn Order

Description
In each round there is a First Player, and turns are taken clockwise from the
first player. There is an action that may be taken to claim a place in the turn
order (typically, but not always, first) for the next round, with play proceeding
clockwise from the First Player. If no one takes the action, turn order remains
unchanged.

Discussion
Similar to Stat Turn Order (TRN-02), Claim Turn Order Action gives more
control to the players over the turn order, as they need to do something to
seize control over the first player marker.
Caution and finesse need to be employed by the designer when using this
system, as there are a number of pitfalls. This technique is often used in Worker
Placement (Chapter 9) or Action Drafting (ACT-02) games, and players will
need to use one of their workers or actions to go first next time. This means
that they are sacrificing something to gain that advantage. Balancing the
cost can be tricky as the value of going first can be variable from situation to

42

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

situation, and player to player. The value of simply going first may not be that
great, so players may avoid using an action to be first player. In this case, the
same player gets to remain first player without losing an action. They simply
remains first player by default.
Designers can sweeten the value of claiming turn order by including other
resources or abilities with it. For example, in Agricola, the player who chooses
the First Player action may also play a Minor Improvement.
More importantly, the player to the left of the player who chooses to go
first gets a great boon. They will get to play second, which, while not as good
as going first, was obtained with absolutely no effort on their part. Agricola
suffers quite a bit from this issue, as it is of great benefit to be to the left of the
player who chose to go first, and frustrating to be the player to the right, who
will now go last, through no fault or action of their own.
First Class: All Aboard the Orient Express deals with this issue by giving
bonuses to all positions when the First Player token is chosen as an action.
In a four-player game, the player who chose to go first gains two coins, the
third player may take a Train Card, and the fourth player may either take or
upgrade a Train Card. The player who will now be going second receives no
bonus—being able to go second in the round while not giving anything up
is deemed sufficient compensation. The First Class system gives the designer
a lot of flexibility in balancing the different player positions.
Another pitfall to avoid is scripted play—obviously-best moves by players.
In earlier editions of the game Twilight Imperium, players chose an Action
card on their turn to perform. One of them gave a Victory Point to the player
choosing it, which was very powerful, and another let a player become First
Player. Because the free Victory Point card was so strong, play almost always
followed a scripted pattern. The first player to go would take the free Victory
Point card, and the second player would take the card to become First Player,
thus ensuring they would get the free Victory Point next turn.
Turn order ended up simply moving around the table, devolving into a
Progressive turn structure. However, the presentation of turn order as a choice
made it seem as if the game had more flexibility than it actually did. Having
forcing moves for the first two players made for a much less interesting play
experience. A similar issue arises in Stone Age, where expanding fields and
gaining workers are invariably the first two actions chosen in each round.
Sometimes the action that determines turn order is tightly integrated into
play. High Society has players bidding on objects, and the winner of an auction
begins the bidding for the next auction. Trick taking games, where the winner
of a trick takes the lead is a similar example, which will be explored in more

Turn Order and Structure

43

detail in Chapter 13. In both of these examples, play proceeds clockwise from
the new start player.
A variant of this mechanism is seen in Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery
and other games. In these, players take an action to secure their place in the turn
order, but more than one player can do this. The first player to do so becomes
the first player in the next round, the second player becomes second, and so on.
Players who do not take this action are moved to the back of the turn order.
This has similar issues to both the classic version of this mechanism and
the Pass Order mechanism (TRN-06). Players must give up the opportunity
for an action to improve their place in the turn order, and players that are
currently early in the order have less incentive to spend an action there. Also,
players that are early in the turn order have a better opportunity to keep it
because they will have a first chance of using later round actions to maintain
their turn position.
However, it does mitigate some of the issues of the base version of this
mechanism, as it puts more control into the hands of the players, albeit in an
inequitable way.

Pass Order

Description
On their turn, players may either take an action or pass. The first player who
passes becomes the new first player for the next round. The second player who
passes becomes the second player for the next round, and so on. Reversing
pass order and turn order is also possible when going later in turn order is
more advantageous.

Discussion
Pass Order attempts to address the issues created by more static turn-order
mechanisms, or those which order all players based on the actions of a single
player. With Pass Order, players are presented with a choice: take additional
actions this turn, or be earlier in the turn order for the entire next round. Players
have to estimate whether continuing to take actions in the current round is
worth more than having an earlier choice on actions in the following round.
A good place for this mechanism is in a game that features some type of
drafting (CAR-06). In Caylus, players place workers on buildings (“Worker
Placement,” Chapter 9) to receive certain benefits. Each building can be
occupied by only one player each round, so players are drafting from a limited
pool of possible actions. Going earlier in turn order ensures players can select
the buildings they desire most. But taking additional actions later in the turn
order can yield additional benefits.
Games in which players are very likely to take an equal number of actions
in a round are a poor fit for this mechanism. For example, if players only
have three actions in a turn, most likely they will all be passing after the same

Turn Order and Structure

45

number of turns. If players take six or more actions in a round, the cost of
losing later actions in the round is much reduced.
An important consideration with Action/Passing is the fate of the last
player who has not passed. This is an issue that affects any game in which
players end their round by choosing to pass. For example, in The Networks,
players receive more money or victory points for passing early, rather than
turn order position. Nevertheless, because The Networks is a Rochester draft
(see “CAR-06, Drafting” in Chapter 13), there are relatively few limits on the
ability of the last player still active to sweep up whatever cards remain on the
board. This can be quite powerful! Other games, like Francis Drake, limit the
ability of the last player to gain too much advantage by requiring expending a
limited pool of workers to activate the remaining buildings. Caylus addresses
this issue in a different way, by making it increasingly expensive to place
workers as more players pass. Finally, in Sentient, players who pass first go
last, which actually provides them with the advantage of sweeping the board.
Designers using this structure should be careful to align the turn order
reward (first or last) with the game. The mechanism works best when turn
order preference is strong, when players act many times over the course of
a single round, and when there is some hard limit on the total number of
actions a player can take. Rewards other than turn order advantage can be
employed as an alternative or in addition.
Two final notes of caution. First, designers must provide some physical
affordances for tracking who has passed and in what order. Ideally, these are
combined so that when a player passes, they move some indicator to show
that they have passed, and when they will play in a future turn. Secondly,
designers should also pay attention to the amount of downtime experienced
by the first player to pass.

Real-Time

Description
There are no turns. Players play as quickly as possible, subject to certain
constraints, until the game or phase is completed.

Discussion
Real-Time Games bring a lot of excitement to the table, as players frantically
work to completely execute their actions. However, they also bring a lot of
challenges for the designer.
First, Real-Time Games need to be very simple. Anything that causes
confusion requires the players to stop the action, resolve the issue, and then
continue, or just carry on with a confused player who stops enjoying the
experience, or possibly violates the rules unwittingly. This can place very real
constraints on what can and can’t be done from a design standpoint.
The designer also needs to address timing issues, if players are conflicting
in actions they wish to perform. There are several ways to deal with this:
• Players play cards onto stacks. Sequence in the stack indicates order.
• The player who touches a token first is allowed to manipulate it.
• Players do not interact during the real-time portion, but only after it is
completed and things can be resolved at leisure.
The level of intensity and focus required from players in a Real-Time Game
means that the game’s length needs to be short. Twenty minutes is a reasonable
maximum duration for a completely uninterrupted Real-Time Game.

Turn Order and Structure

47

Another consideration is dealing with mistakes and cheating. Some games,
like Pit Crew and Space Alert have specific rules for dealing with mistakes that
give a penalty to the players or cancel the attempted action.
As players are absorbed in their own actions, cheating can also be an issue.
In cooperative games like Space Alert, cheating is a different consideration.
However, for competitive games, the designer may need to incorporate design
techniques such as making sure that everything is in the open, that text on
cards is large enough to be understood across the table rapidly, and that there
is as little manipulation of components as possible (e.g., once a card or die is
placed in a spot, it cannot be moved from that spot).
However, there have been several successful games that have not protected
against mistakes and cheating, and it does not appear to have impacted their
success. In Captain Sonar (more correctly classified as using a Punctuated
Real-Time mechanism, TRN-08), each team writes and erases on laminated
control panels behind a screen. It would be quite simple for a team to cheat
behind the screen or make undetected mistakes. In practice, however, the
social contract seems to hold and players are not concerned about this. This
may open up more complex design opportunities for Real-Time Games, as
long as the game is marketed toward an audience that accepts this stance
regarding potential cheating.
Because of nonstop nature of Real-Time Games, they are often structured
with two phases: Action and Resolution. Action is when the real-time action
occurs. After a condition is met, typically a timer expiring, but possibly when
a task is completed, or when a hand or deck of cards is exhausted, there is a
Resolution phase. In this phase, results of the action phase are determined,
without any time pressure. This two-mode approach allows for complex
mechanisms that might otherwise not be possible.
There are typically two types of endings to a real-time phase. In the first,
whenever the end-phase condition is met, the phase ends immediately. Players
are informed that it is over, and that is that. Spit (aka Speed or Blitz) and PickA-Polar Bear are both triggered when one player reaches a particular game
state (all cards gone from their deck in Spit, and no more legal options to take
a card in Polar Bear). At that time, the phase instantly completes.
Some games use the phase-end trigger to set up “bonus time” for the other
players, informing them that they have a set amount of additional time before
the phase ends. For example, in Show & Tile, the first player to complete their
artwork flips a sand timer. When that timer runs out, the artwork phase is
over, and players proceed to the guessing phase. Other games flip this dynamic
around, and give players who finish early an additional bonus task that must

48

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

be completed by the time all players finish the core task. In Pit Crew, when a
team finishes the real-time task of repairing its car and getting it out on the
track, the team switches to rolling a die to move the car, rolling over and over.
Meanwhile, the other teams continue to repair their car, and start rolling their
own die if other teams are still working. The last team to finish does not roll
its die, but stops all other teams from rolling. This puts added pressure and
tension on the teams who are still working on their repairs while others move
around the track, and adds some narrative arc to the activity.

Punctuated Real-Time

Description
There are no turns. Players play as quickly as possible, subject to certain
constraints, until the game or phase is completed. Play is also interrupted
by specific player actions, which are resolved before resuming the real-time
action.

Discussion
Punctuated Real-Time is a variation on real-time (TRN-07), and the
difference is subtle. Whereas in a real-time game the action stops when some
condition is met—a timer going off, or a deck exhausting—in a Punctuated
Real-Time Game, the action may be stopped at any time, at the discretion of
a player, or upon taking a valid stopping action.
In Space Cadets: Dice Duel and Captain Sonar, players stop the action by
shouting something (“Fire Torpedoes” or “Launch Mine”), and all players
stop what they are doing to resolve the action.
To a certain extent, this mechanism is also present in the early twentieth
century game Pit, as players end the real-time trading portion by hitting a
bell, after which the round is evaluated. Also dating back over a hundred
years, baseball and American football are also exemplars of Punctuated RealTime, where teams can plan, organize, substitute, and catch their breath prior
to initiating the next pitch or play.
Punctuated Real-Time adds an additional layer of tension to what is already
the tense mechanism of real-time. Players do not necessarily see the stoppage

50

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

of play coming. In Pit, you don’t know how close the other players are to
winning the round. It also gives more flexibility to the designer on a number
of levels. First, it allows for the inclusion of more complex mechanisms, as
they can be resolved during the “stoppage time.” Firing a torpedo in Captain
Sonar falls into this category, as the resolution can include complexity that
would normally be beyond what is reasonable in a Real-Time Game.
Second, Punctuated Real-Time allows the game to be longer, as the
stoppage time gives players an opportunity to catch their breath, or even get
a snack or go to the restroom. In a fully Real-Time Game such as Escape:
The Curse of the Temple, action that continues more than 10–20 minutes
or so risks exhausting and overwhelming the player. Punctuated Real-Time
gives the designer a tool to created nonscheduled breaks to give the players a
breather, allowing for a longer, more complex and textured overall experience.

Simultaneous Action Selection

Description
Players plan their turn simultaneously and secretly. Then, they reveal their
plans at the same time.

Discussion
A Simultaneous Action Selection Game has players selecting actions at the
same time, but actions are generally resolved in turn order. The action-selection
mechanism will usually include a sub-system for determining the order by
which the action resolution phase will be played. For example, in Libertalia,
players choose a role card from their hand, and play it face down. Then, all
cards are revealed simultaneously, and the lowest-numbered card revealed is
resolved first. Each player in Libertalia has the same role cards in their hands,
so duplicate plays occur frequently. To resolve these ties, each card also shows
a unique priority number. Robo Rally, a classic in the genre, uses a similar
priority number mechanism to sequence the players once cards are revealed.
Priority numbers are not necessarily required for Simultaneous Action
Selection. Race for the Galaxy has players simultaneously select which roles
they would like to execute, but then the roles are always performed in a specific
order. See the Role Order mechanism for more details (TRN-10).
Typically, cards are used to implement this mechanism, although other
game objects, such as tiles or dice, can also be used. In Incan Gold, each turn

52

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

players simultaneously decide whether they are going to remain in the cave
or return to camp. In the original version (called Diamant) players indicated
this choice by secretly holding their wooden adventurer figure in their hand
or having an empty fist. Later versions replaced this with placing a “Stay”
or “Go” card face down. In the A Game of Thrones board game, actions are
planned using order tokens that are placed face down, and then revealed by
flipping them all face up.
This mechanism gives players the opportunity to try to anticipate what their
opponents will do, and plan accordingly. The general term for mechanisms
which have players trying to guess what their opponents will do is called “Yomi,”
a Japanese word. We discuss Yomi in more detail in UNC-01.
Simultaneous Action Selection can also speed up games and reduce
downtime, as players are acting simultaneously. However, if the planning
is extensive, as in Diplomacy and A Game of Thrones, it can give room for
Negotiation (ECO-18) and increased strategy, which adds length.

Role Order

Description
Players secretly and simultaneously select an action, role, or priority. Then
they are revealed, and the actions/roles revealed determine the order in which
players act.

Discussion
Role Order is a subset of Simultaneous Action Selection (TRN-09). There
are several ways to implement this mechanism. Citadels, for example, has
players draft roles (like Thief or Assassin). There is one card for each role in a
deck. Some of the roles are removed without any of the players knowing their
identity. The first player then looks at the remaining roles, chooses one, and
passes the remaining cards to the left.
After each player has selected a role, the first player calls out the roles from
first to last, according to their number. Thief, for example, is number two. If
a player has that role, he or she reveals it and takes that action.
Race for the Galaxy has a different approach. Each player simultaneously
selects which of the roles (like Explore or Settle) they wish to play. Then all
players reveal their choice. The roles are resolved in a defined order (e.g.,
Explore is always first). For each role that is chosen by at least one player,
all players get to perform it, but the player(s) who chose it get a bonus via a

54

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

more powerful version of the action. More on this in the Follow mechanism
(ACT-08).
If no one selects a role, it is skipped, so if players really want a specific role to
occur, they can select it, or gamble that, based on the situation, other players
are likely to select it, affording them the opportunity to choose something
else. This introduces an element of Yomi (UNC-01), as players attempt to
outguess each other.
In both of these games, players are not guaranteed that certain roles will
occur. This is typical of implementations of this mechanism, as a result of
the hidden role selection—if all the roles were in play, players could readily
deduce which roles were taken before them.
Using Role Order allows Citadels to introduce an interesting twist. The
player who chooses the Assassin role names another role that will have to lose
a turn. Note that it is the role that is targeted, not the player. Players losing
their turn is an anti-pattern (TRN-16) that usually results in negative feelings
as it gets in the way of doing the activity they sat down to play. However, in
Citadels, the role is targeted, not a specific player. While the Assassin players
may have an idea of who may be more likely to choose a role, they are not sure.
Additionally, the role the Assassin names may not even have been selected that
turn, rendering the ability moot.
Role Order allows the designers to control the order in which operations
occur, while giving players a choice about which of those will happen. It also
introduces a well-defined turn order that doesn’t suffer from needing to have
a mechanism to shift the first player. It happens naturally.

Random Turn Order

Description
Representatives of play pieces or players are randomized, and one is drawn
at a time. That player or play piece takes its turn, then a new random draw
is made.

Discussion
Random Turn Order can introduce a lot of excitement and tension to a game,
as players anxiously await which token will be revealed next. However, it also
reduces the ability of the players to plan effectively, which makes it most effective
in lighter games. Games are more tactical, as players need to react to the situation
as it develops, because they can’t predict when their turn will come.
There are ways to increase the ability for strategic planning when using
a Random Turn Order. Pillars of the Earth is a Worker Placement game
(Chapter 9), where workers are pulled from a bag. As with most Worker
Placement games, going early is an advantage, as more and better options
are available. When a player’s piece is pulled, if that player wishes to place it,
they need to pay a cost. This cost starts high, and gradually drops throughout
the turn. If a player does not want to (or cannot) pay the cost, the worker is
placed to the side, and is used to select an action at the very end of the turn.
This presents players with an interesting strategic option of trying to judge
the value of going early. The higher price of going early counteracts the luck
of being drawn early.
In Warrior Knights, actions are represented by cards. Each player selects two
cards from their personal deck that they wish to use that turn. The selections

56

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

from all the players are shuffled together and then they are drawn one at a
time, and the player whose card is chosen performs the corresponding action.
The inability to create a perfect plan has made this a popular mechanism
in war games. Rather than one player moving all pieces, and then the next
player moving all of theirs, a random draw for who gets to activate next helps
simulate battlefield uncertainty, while also reducing downtime for the players.
Firepower implements this type of chit-pull system.
Random Turn Order also gives the war game designer flexibility in
modeling superior and inferior units. For example, in the game A Victory Lost:
Crisis in Ukraine 1942-1943, Activation Chits for units are placed into a cup.
But veteran units receive multiple chits, while new recruits may receive only
one, modeling in a natural way the increased effectiveness of the veterans.
This is a kind of Deck Building system (CAR-05).
Another technique is to include wild card or category tokens, which give
the player a choice of which unit to activate when they are pulled, as long
as they correspond to the matching category. This also increases tactical
flexibility and reduces the luck factor. Battle Masters is an example of a game
that uses this approach.

Action Timer

Description
Players place owned timers on action spaces and pieces and take an action. When
the timer runs out, it may be moved to another location to take that action. There
are no turns; players may move their own timers any time after they have expired.

Discussion
This Action Timer mechanism is typically implemented with sand timers. Timers
allow for a real-time feel (TRN-07), while mitigating their frantic nature. It allows
the game to flow naturally, while giving players some structure and breathing
room to plan their next actions. As such, they can be used for longer periods of
times than would be desirable in a traditional real-time game.
Sand timers can be placed onto fixed spaces on the board to indicate what
actions the players are allowed to take, or onto specific pieces that move
around. In Time ‘n’ Space (a remake of the classic Space Dealer), sand timers
may be placed into a player’s base for research and other actions, or directly
onto a spaceship to allow it to move. Similarly, in War Time, the sand timers
are placed directly on the units, which allows them to move or attack.
Typically, the action is taken when the timer is placed. This allows the player
to place the timer, then actually do the action (take cubes, gain a research card,
perform an attack, move a unit, etc.) while the sands are running. This reduces
overall downtime for the players. If you wait for the timer to end before doing the
action, players will typically quickly move the timer to a new action to get it going,
then go back and execute the original action, which can add some confusion.
In spite of this mechanism being real-time, it can have a fair amount of
downtime for the players and feels sluggish at points as players are watching
the grains to get ready to do their next action. To help mitigate this, players

58

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

usually have multiple sand timers to use, to allow for action combos, and
move things along.
Some games also give players timers of varying durations. In Wartime: The
Battle of Valyance Vale, players have 30, 60, and 90 second timers, and each can
be used for any unit. Deciding which to use adds an additional tactical layer, and
also helps give the player more to do while waiting for other timers to run out.
TAMSK is an abstract game that takes a unique approach to using sand
timers. The pieces are sand timers, and when they make a move the timers
are flipped. A key element is that if a timer runs out of sand, it is locked into
place. This gives players tactical options of how to use the timers, and how
much time they have to think about decisions. A piece that is moved again
shortly after being moved will only have a little time remaining in the timer.
There are a number of physical issues that need to be dealt with in these
games. First, when players interact with each other, there can be contention
about which timer finished first, and so which player might be able to take
an action space or launch an attack first. This can be difficult to adjudicate in
the midst of the game, as timers will continue to run.
Also, while a real-time can be stopped by mutual agreement of the players,
this is harder with a sand timer game. The sand timers need to all be tipped over,
which can take some time and also change the way the sand is distributed while
they lie on their sides—to say nothing of their chances of rolling off the table!
Finally, there are manufacturing variations with sand timers that can lead to
a timing difference of many seconds. A 30-second timer may actually take as
long as 40 seconds to run. Indeed, the same sand timer may run faster or slower
depending on the irregularity of the grains in it and how they happen to fall.
Many timers have different run times depending on which side is up. These
variations need to either simply be accepted, or some type of manufacturing
screening process needs to be implemented, which will add cost to production.
In spite of these issues, sand timer games have a unique feel that deserves
further exploration by designers. Apps and other digital-analog hybrids hold
some promise here as well.

Time Track

Description
There is a linear “Time Track” with many spaces. Each player has a marker
on the track, which indicates where they are “in time.” Markers farther on
the track are further forward in time.
The player with the marker lowest on the track (furthest “back in time”)
takes the next action. Each action has a cost in time, and the player’s marker
is advanced a number of spaces according to that cost. Then, the next lowest
marker on the track takes an action. It is possible that the same player takes
multiple turns in a row.

Discussion
Time Tracks have a number of inherent advantages:
• Clarity: It is obvious who goes next, even though turn order jumps
around a lot.
• Player Control: Players have some choice over who goes next, allowing
for additional tactical play.
• Balance: The designer can include powerful actions, but can give them
a long time duration to compensate.
However, there are, of course, downsides to this technique. It can lead to
players being out of the action for some time if they have taken long-duration
options. Admittedly, they have chosen to do this, but an option available to
players should not result in them having a less enjoyable experience.
To prevent this situation, designers typically do not include very long
duration activities. However, this compression of durations into a narrower
range works against the benefits and promise of this system, as players usually

60

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

are quite close together on the Time Track. The Dragon & Flagon, for example,
has actions that range from 1 to 4 Time. Most of the actions in Thebes are in a
similar range, although players can opt to dig for artifacts for up to 12 Time,
which will give their opponents the opportunity to perform many actions
before their turn comes around again.
Because of this tight duration grouping, players frequently will share a
space on the Time Track. These ties are usually resolved by having the player
on top of the stack (the last piece to arrive there) move first. However, this
“Last-in-First-out,” or LIFO, system will give players guaranteed double
moves in some situations. Depending on the game, this may not be an issue,
and may even be desirable. But for some, it may be too powerful and some
mediation needs to happen. In The Dragon and Flagon, for example, Turn
Order is randomly determined when multiple players share the same space.
Another alternative is to only allow one piece per space on the Time
Track, forcing players who would otherwise occupy a space to move one or
more spaces further forward until they find an empty space. This can add an
extra layer of decision making, as the actual cost of certain actions may vary
based on the positioning of the opponent. Glen More and Kraftwagen use
this system. When the game offers only a limited amount of time, or creates
triggers based on specific spaces on the track, the particulars of how ties are
handled and whether players skip spaces become especially important.
High Rise combines a Time Track with an Action Selection mechanism.
Each space on the Time Track has an associated action. When players move
to the space, they execute the Action. The player furthest back on the track
moves first, and two players may not occupy the same space, giving players
the choice of moving far forward to guarantee a needed action, but potentially
giving their opponents multiple turns.

Typically, to prevent stalling and to keep the game moving, in games with
multiple Action Tokens, if both tokens are held by the same player, then they
suffer a penalty.

Discussion
This mechanism is a cross between a real-time-based and a turn-based game.
Similar to the Action Timer mechanism (TRN-12), it allows players to play
at their own pace, and asynchronously, but gives some structure.
However, in the Action Timer mechanism, the players are basically
independent of each other, and can operate simultaneously. Here, players are
linked more closely, in that your turn can only start when the player before
you in turn order finishes his or her turn. This helps solve the dilemma of
players breaking rules (either inadvertently or deliberately) that is present in

62

other real-time mechanisms by having some players be inactive and able to
watch what other players are doing and interrupt if necessary. This allows for
more complex mechanisms within the game itself as opposed to traditional
real-time games.
For the most part, in order for this mechanism to work, there needs
to be multiple Action Tokens being passed around the circle at the same
time. The exception is if the round itself is timed in some fashion and
having possession of the Action Token causes a player to lose. Hot Potato
and Catch Phrase! are examples of this, where the player holding the item
when time runs out loses.
When using multiple Action Tokens, a key design element is what
happens if multiple tokens end up with the same player. In Camelot, if
another token would be passed to a player who already has one, it instead
skips that player and goes to the person to his or her left. This is equivalent
to losing a turn, as other players will get to act a second time before the
affected player. While we recommend against players losing a turn and
classify it as an anti-pattern (TRN-16), in this case the opportunity to
avoid losing a turn lies with the player, and is not luck-based. Therefore,
it is an understandable and satisfying solution to use in this case. It forces
players to move at a reasonable pace, at least comparable in speed to the
other players.
Yet, it does not mean that fast players will always win, depending on the
design of the game. If a reasonably thought out single move will beat a hasty
double move, then the system will be fine, as just doing something as quickly
as possible will not be rewarded. The players will need to balance “optimal”
and “good enough.”
An alternative system is seen in Diner. In this game, if a second Action
Token ends up with the same player, it just sits there until he or she completes
his or her move, and pass the first token to the next player. There is no
“lapping” as there is in Camelot. This can lead to slower and more conservative
play, but in this game it is helped by forcing players to compete to take shared
cards in a central tableau, so playing slowly in general will allow the other
players to grab more desirable cards.
It is also possible to use this as an overlay or subset of another structure.
Space Cadets uses a real-time turn structure, but in certain situations an
Action Token (a small deck of cards in this case) is passed around to allow
players to perform a special action beyond what they can normally do.
Eclipse uses two Action Tokens in a variant mode that can accommodate
as many as 9 players. The only distinction between the tokens is that one

provides priority over the other for acquiring new technologies. The system is
surprisingly effective at speeding along what would otherwise be an unplayable
behemoth of a game.

Interleaved vs. Sequential Phases

Description
This describes two different meta-turn structures. In an Interleaved Phase
structure (a), all players perform the first phase, then all perform the second
phase, etc. In a Sequential Phase structure (b), each player performs all phases
before moving on to the next player, who then performs all phases, etc.

Discussion
Interleaved structures in general are preferred in modern design, as they
re­duce downtime between player actions. War games in the 70s and 80s were
notorious for their “I Go, You Go” structures, where one player would take
a turn that could last for a very long time, with the other player wandering
off to do some other activity. In the 80s and 90s this started to shift, with
designers moving to Interleaved turn structures to keep players more engaged
throughout.
However, there are plenty of games that stick to a Sequential turn structure
for a variety of reasons. The Russian Campaign, a simulation of the German
invasion of Russia during World War II, uses a strictly Sequential turn structure.
Each player performs all of these steps before the turn passes to the next player:
•
•
•
•
•

Receive Reinforcements and Replacements
Move All Units
Combat
Breakthrough Movement
Breakthrough Combat

Turn Order and Structure

65

The Sequential structure of The Russian Campaign is integral to the strategy
and experience of the game. Allowing one player to move and attack twice
before the opponent gets to do anything gives the game epic swings and
devastating breakthroughs and does a particularly good job of capturing the
early and late phases of the war, which featured large-scale encirclements and
desperate breakouts.
In contrast, Power Grid uses an Interleaved turn structure. There are three
main Phases in each Round:
• Buy Power Plants
• Buy Raw Materials
• Build Power Lines
In turn, all players perform Buy Power Plants, then in turn all players perform
Raw Materials, etc. There is little time between a player taking their next action.
Any turn structure can be used inside the meta-structures of Sequential and
Interleaved. For example, Power Grid uses a Stat Order structure (TRN-02).
These structures aren’t mutually exclusive: some parts of a game may be
interleaved, and some may be sequential, and different Turn Order structures
may be used for each. For example, Simultaneous Turn structure is frequently
appropriate during upkeep or planning phases even though movement may
be sequential. As always, these different mechanisms are tools, and each has
its place and circumstance.

Lose a Turn

Description
This is a meta-mechanism that can be applied to a variety of turn structures.
A player who “Loses a Turn” must skip their next opportunity for a turn, and
will go to the next round, or the next time their turn arises.

Discussion
Losing a Turn was common in Roll and Move games of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries (MOV-02). In current game design philosophy, it
is considered an anti-pattern to be avoided, as it was frequently used as a
possible outcome of landing on a particular space or drawing a card—which
were, themselves, random. Losing a Turn keeps the player from enjoying
and participating in the game, and can be very frustrating if one player is
disproportionately affected. Mostly though, it frustrates the intent of the
player as a person seeking to engage in an activity. Players want to play a
game, and losing your turn means not playing a game. Like the ads on the
radio that interrupt the music, if it happens too often, players will “change
stations” and play something else.
There are other mechanisms where players are allowed to take a turn,
but may end up not doing anything, which can be equally an issue, that are
functionally (and psychologically) generally equivalent to Lose a Turn. An
example may be having to win a Roll and Move game by “exact count,” such
as Trouble or Snakes & Ladders. In these games, players may only win by
advancing to the final space by getting exactly what they need, and can result
in many turns of fruitlessly rolling a die and spinning a spinner. While the
players are still getting a turn, and there is some excitement in seeing if the
player will win, it still can become frustrating if it lasts many turns.

Turn Order and Structure

67

Similarly, games like Sorry! require certain values to leave “Home” and, in
essence, start the game. Again, this can result in many consecutive turns of
inactivity, which leads to frustration and boredom. Monopoly can send players
to Jail, where they will need to roll doubles to escape. Monopoly has some
remediation to this “Lose a Turn” effect, as players may choose to pay to get
out of Jail, or, in later stages of the game, may prefer (and hope) to remain in
Jail to avoid the possibility of paying high rents.
There are other effects that are similar to losing a turn. In a Worker
Placement game (Chapter 9), losing a worker for a round is equivalent to losing
a turn. In an Action Retrieval system (ACT-03), the turn that the Actions
are retrieved can feel like a lost turn to players. In a card game where you are
trying to discard all your cards by playing one per turn (like UNO), having to
draw cards is similar to “Losing a Turn” in terms of tempo, although it does
not impinge on the player’s participation in the game. Similarly, when some
players gain extra turns, this is equivalent to the others losing a turn. However,
due to psychological framing effects, these more modern takes do not feel as
bad. Thus, giving extra turns to other players or removing resources can be a
better solution for including “Lose a Turn” effects.
If the reason that a turn is lost is in control of the player, then this antipattern is mediated. If players choose to take a risky course or over-spend
a resource that leaves them unable to take a turn, that can be an effective
design, as it is resulting from player action, and is not perceived the same
psychologically by players. As an example, in the Passed Action Token
game, Camelot (TRN-14), players who play too slowly may miss a turn if the
other Action Token catches up to them. Instead of making a game slow and
frustrating, this adds excitement, as players can see the Action Token getting
closer, and players have the ability to play faster to avoid losing a turn.

Monopoly (Darrow and Magie, 1933)
Snakes & Ladders (Unknown, ∼200 bce)

Interrupts

Description
This is a meta-mechanism for Turn Order. Players may take an action that
interrupts the normal turn flow.

Discussion
This mechanism can be used with almost any of the turn structures discussed.
The ability to interrupt an opponent during their turn can be an important
part of the design. The interruption can be a standard ability that players have
and can be based on cards in their hands or other special tokens.
Squad Leader is an example of the “standard ability” style. During the
Movement Phase, one player moves their pieces or stacks one-by-one, one space
at a time. The other player (the “defender” for that turn) may, at any time,
interrupt movement to take a Defensive Fire opportunity at the moving units.
This is an option that is always available to units; no special ability is required.
Magic: The Gathering, in contrast, features some cards that are labelled as
Instants. These cards can be played in response to the opponent taking an
action. Other games frequently will call these cards Reactions. If you don’t
have a Reaction card, you will not be able to take a Reaction.
Incorporating Interrupts into the design has a number of positive features.
First, it keeps players engaged. If you can interrupt what your opponent is
doing, you can look for the perfect opportunity to strike, and it encourages
players to pay attention to what’s going on. This reduces downtime, or
perceived downtime. Before Squad Leader, war games mostly had a strict “I
Go, You Go” structure, which made it appealing for players to mentally check
out when it was not their turn.
In Squad Leader, even if defenders never take a Defensive Fire shot, they
feel like it was their turn as well, in a way because they were always evaluating
the option. Similarly, in games where you can play Reaction cards, players
need to monitor the action continuously.

Turn Order and Structure

69

Interrupts add uncertainty and chaos to the game and undermine the
ability of players to create a perfect plan. You cannot be certain that the squad
will make it across the street, or that the monster will successfully attack. This
can be positive or negative depending on the goal of the design.
It also gives a leg up to players who are more familiar with the game than
new players. Understanding the range of possible opponent responses gives
experienced players an advantage when formulating their plans. Even if they
can’t be perfect, they can plan contingencies for possible opponent responses.
Because of their asynchronous nature, Interrupts require rules and
conventions around their play, to give players the opportunity to react, and
also to adjudicate if multiple players want to react at the same time.
In Squad Leader, for example, there is a specific rule that a player moving a
stack of units must pause briefly after each space is entered to give an opponent
the opportunity to announce Defensive Fire. This requires cooperation of the
players to keep these pauses long enough for players to decide, but short enough
not to unduly lengthen the game. Conventions may be developed, such as a
player being allowed to request a few extra seconds to make a decision.
Similarly, when playing reaction cards, there needs to be an opportunity
for players to play them.
Some designs allow Interrupts to themselves be interrupted. Obviously,
the system needs to prevent infinite Interrupts, typically by playing a card
to execute them. There also needs to be a system to handle these multiples.
Magic: The Gathering uses a LIFO system, using an Instant stack. If a player
wants to play an Instant in response to another Instant, it is played on top of the
earlier card. When all Instants have been played into this stack, they are resolved
from the top down. So the first card to be played will be the last to be resolved.
Some games will actually allow the Interrupt to change the turn order. For
example, in Mille Bornes, a player may respond to a Hazard card being played
on them by playing the matching Safety. If they do, the interrupting player
immediately becomes the active player, and takes a normal turn. The players
between the old active player and interrupting player are skipped, losing their
turn (TRN-16).

Actions

ӶӶ
When watching a movie, or seeing a play, the story progresses independent
of the viewer. Games, however, require action by the player to move things
forward. These actions may be based purely on luck, rely solely on the player’s
skill, or lie somewhere in between. But a fundamental differentiator of games
from many other activities is that the players must act.
While later chapters will discuss what those specific actions might be, this
one describes different ways that the players are permitted by the designer to
take actions, and the way that those flow. Thus, the mechanisms discussed
here should be viewed in conjunction with the Turn Structures of Chapter 2.
An Action is an atomic step or series of steps that a player chooses to
perform. For example, moving a piece, picking up a cube, selling a share
of stock, or initiating combat may all be Actions. An Action may also be
compound, allowing a player to both pick up a cube and sell a share of stock,
depending on the structure and metaphor of the game.
The selection and integration of Actions into the game can give play a
specific feel. These Action systems control the complexity of the game, in
terms of the number of Actions a player may perform consecutively and
how they interrelate, the interaction between players, and other features.
Manipulation of the Action system, like in a Rondel (ACT-10, Rondel
Games) or Action Queue (ACT-06), can become the focus of the game itself
and a key mechanism. Or it can simply provide a framework that fades into
the background.
If a game is not interactive enough or is overwhelming players with too
many choices, the root of the problem is frequently in the way Actions are
made available to the players. Looking closer at that part of the design may
pay dividends.

ACT-01

Action Points

Description
A player receives a number of Action Points on their turn. They may spend
them on a variety of Actions.

Discussion
This is a very general mechanism that is isomorphic to a variety of game
structures. However, some generalities can be discussed.
A common implementation of this mechanism is that a player receives
a fixed number of Action Points on their turn, and can spend them on any
combination of Actions, each of which spends one of those points. Pandemic,
for example, gives a player four Action Points each turn, which can be spent
by on several Actions like moving to another city or removing a disease cube.
Tikal takes a similar approach, but Actions may cost more than one Action
Point. Each player gets 10 Action Points for the turn, and the cost of Actions
ranges from 1 to 4. This can dramatically increase the decision space for
players, so the designer needs to be cognizant of the additional weight this
will add to the game.
A game may have multiple currencies of Action Points. Through the Ages: A
Story of Civilization has two types of Action Points: Civil and Military. Each
may only be spent on specific types of Actions.
Variations of this mechanism may also limit players to only performing
an Action one time per turn. Some allow players to leave some Action Points

Actions

73

unused to be carried over to the next turn, and others require that all be spent
or lost.
Many games use this mechanism without explicitly awarding Action
Points to the players. For example, the game may simply tell players that
they may do two out of three possible Actions, or even one. In Feudum, each
player simultaneously selects four out of eleven Action cards available in a
personal pool to use each turn. This makes it obvious whether an Action can
be performed multiple times, or just once, depending on many copies of the
same Action card are in the deck.
A variant of an Action Point system is found in Starship Samurai. Here,
players select the Action they wish to perform from a limited menu. They
must also use one of their order counters, which are numbered from 1 to 4.
The number determines the number of times the Action may be executed.
For example, if players choose the Move Action and use their “3” token, they
get to move 3 units.
Action Point systems give the players a lot of flexibility in how they
approach their turn. The pace of the game can be controlled by the designer
by changing the number of Action Points available each turn. Small values
will lead to quicker turns. Larger values will lengthen turns, but also open
up more space for combos.

Action Drafting

Description
Players select from an assortment of Actions in a shared pool. The available
Actions are limited in quantity, and once a player has chosen an Action it may
not be chosen again.

Discussion
This mechanism creates player interaction within the Action selection itself.
While many games have Actions, typically if an Action is chosen by one
player, that does not deny it to another. Action Drafting creates a marketplace
for Actions, with players competing to select them.
Action Drafting is a very common mechanism that goes by a variety of names,
such as Role Selection or Worker Placement. In a Worker Placement mechanism,
players place pawns (“workers”) onto Action spaces on a board, performing that
Action and denying it to their opponents. Because of the variety and importance
of Worker Placement, we have dedicated Chapter 9 to exploring its considerations
and variations. The issues discussed there, such as the strength of the first player
advantage, apply to most of the mechanisms discussed here as well.
Citadels is an example of a Role Selection implementation of Action Drafting.
In Citadels, the start player takes all the role cards (which show their associated
actions), selects an Action card, and then passes the remaining cards to the player
to the left. Because the card chosen is secret, this system generates information
asymmetry (UNC-05). Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy are similar examples of
Role Selection, as in a round each player selects (drafts) a role and gets to perform

Actions

75

associated actions. Puerto Rico allows players to perform a less powerful version of
the action drafted by the player (see “Follow, ACT-08” in this chapter), while Race
for the Galaxy also has Follow but allows players to select the same role.
Another frequent implementation of this system uses a Dice Pool. At the start
of the Action Selection phase, a number of dice are rolled, and each number
corresponds to a specific action. In La Granja, for example, all the 4s rolled are
placed into the “Take 4 Coins” action space. Once all dice are placed in their
boxes, the players take turns selecting a die, and performing the associated
action. In a separate twist, there is an extra die left over after all players have
selected two action dice, and every player gets to perform that final action.
An Action Drafting system based on a dice pool works against perfect
plans, as players need to adapt to whatever is available. In addition, it forces
players to consider not just their own plans, but also what their opponents
may need. Players may consider taking a sub-optimal choice in order to
deprive it from their opponents (so-called “hate drafting”).
Another variant is found in Dungeon Lords. In this game, players secretly
select three out of six possible Action cards, placing them secretly face down
in front of them in order. Each player then reveals their first card, and places
tokens on the selected spaces (with ties in order being broken by a Start Player
token). The players who place earlier on each Action space can perform more
powerful versions of the Actions.
In War of the Ring, each player has their own dice pool, and players alternate
selecting one of their dice. These systems are not really drafting, in that
players are not denying their opponent an Action. However, it does restrict
the range of possible Actions, gives players flexibility, and an understanding
of the possible Actions available to their opponent.

Action Retrieval

Description
Each player has a set of Actions available to them, embodied in cards, tokens,
or some other affordance. Once performed, they are spent and may not be
performed again until retrieved. Action Retrieval typically is itself an Action,
or may take an entire turn.

Actions

77

Discussion
This mechanism focuses on efficiency. Because retrieving the used cards takes
an Action, players that retrieve more frequently will be at a disadvantage, as
they will conduct fewer Actions that advance their cause.
The Actions usually span a gamut of discrete options that affect different
aspects of the game. For example, Assault of the Giants has the actions: Move,
Attack, Recruit, Make Alliance, and Leader. Once players use Move, they
cannot play it again until they take a Retrieve turn, which restores all action
cards used since the last Retrieve. This stops players from selecting a specific
Action like Recruiting over and over again, and forces them to adopt balanced
strategies, and plan several turns ahead. Therefore, a game that adopts this
mechanism has a much more strategic feel. It also allows for additional
tactical play, as opponents will know, for example, that you do not have a
Move action available, and will not be able to respond to opponents moving
to different areas.
Many games introduce additional wrinkles to reward planning and
sequencing. Assault of the Giants, for example, makes Actions more powerful
the more Actions were previously played. For example, if the Move card is
played as the first card after a Retrieve, only one unit can move. But if Recruit
and Attack have been played before Move, then three units may move.
Another variation is a mix of one-time and recoverable cards. Gloomhaven
has some action cards that can only be used one time during a scenario.
Others may be recovered by having a character Rest.

ACT-04

Action/Event

Description
On their turn, the player plays a card that shows Action Points and an Event.
They must choose to either use the Action Points or perform the Event. If
They choose to use Action Points, typically the Event may be performed by
another player.

Discussion
This mechanism builds on a basic Action Point system, and allows designers
to integrate a lot of flavor and special actions to a system to emphasize theme.
It was pioneered in historical simulations as a way of introducing historical
events without unduly adding rules overhead. For example, Twilight Struggle,
a simulation of the Cold War, has a card that can either be used for 3 Action
Points or the Warsaw Pact event. If the Action Points are chosen, there is a
standard list of Actions on which they can be spent (ACT-01).
Many games incorporate an Event Deck (ACT-17), which is another way
to include special effects and deeper theming. However, the Action/Event
system gives players another layer of choice, rather than simply imposing
global effects.
Often, games using this system add another layer of player decision-making
by having some or all events only eligible for specific players. For example, in

Actions

79

We The People, a simulation of the American Revolution, certain events may
only be performed by the Colonists, and others by Great Britain. If a player is
not eligible for the event on a card, they must use the Action Points. Similarly,
some events are dependent on specific locations, control of particular areas,
the presence of certain characters, etc. In Empires of the Void II, for example,
events can be tied to specific planets, and if those planets are not in play or
the player is unable to execute some condition related to that planet, the player
may only use the card for its point value, rather than the event. In World War
II: Barbarossa to Berlin there are prerequisite events that must be triggered
before other events may be used.
Twilight Struggle takes this even further, letting the opponent use an Event
if the card is played for the Action Points. For example, the Warsaw Pact event
can only be used by the USSR player. If the USA player plays the card, he or
she must use the 3 Action Points, and the USSR will perform the Event. This
makes choosing and sequencing card play very important.
Twilight Struggle and We the People are two-player games. This system
is extended to multiplayer in The Expanse Board Game, which supports up
to four players, each of whom represents a faction. Between two and four
factions are eligible for each event, and if a player uses the Action Points, the
other players are given the option to perform it, in a priority order.

Command Cards

Description
Players have a hand of cards that allows them to activate and perform actions
with a subset of their units.

Discussion
Players have a hand of cards that represent different geographic regions or unit
types and must play one each turn. When a geographic region card is played,
units that are located in the region(s) indicated on the card may take Actions.
If a Unit Type card is played, only units of that type may take Actions.
For example, in Memoir ’44 the cards may represent left flank, right
flank, center, or unit combinations, for example, all Tank units. Players have
an indication of their future range of actions based on the cards in their
hands, which allows for a level of planning. Hand size limits help define the
information horizon and amount of look-ahead players can engage in.

Actions

81

In a traditional war game, players can take actions with all of their units
each turn. Command Card systems limit this to a subset of units, which
reduces the length of turns, and simplifies decision-making, giving the game
a lighter feel.
Some games, like Risk: Star Wars Edition, give players a range of one to
three possible activation choices, building in greater flexibility and planning.
In the extreme limit, with one unit at a time being activated, this mechanism
reduces to a Chit Draw system (TRN-11).

ACT-06

Action Queue

Description
Players create Action Queues and perform them in sequence.

Discussion
While this mechanism has many different implementations, at its core, the
idea is that players must plan their actions and commit to a specific sequence
of execution. For example, players may have to plot the movement of a robot
by placing three Action cards in sequence that may, for example, cause the
robot to move forward two spaces, then turn left, then move one more space.
The types of actions, the way they are revealed and resolved, and other
specifics have several variations.
Action Queues emphasize planning, but can also introduce chaos, as
players commit to a course of action several steps or turns in advance,
keep them hidden from the other players, and have limited opportunity to
change the plan. This introduces Yomi (UNC-01), as players try to guess
what other players will do and what the board state may look like in the
future.
Actions are typically represented by cards, as they can contain a lot of
information about the preconditions and resolution. Tiles can also be used
but need to be simpler. Queues can either be Rolling, where the Action at the
head of the queue is revealed and performed as a new Action is added to the

Actions

83

end, or Batch, where a set number of cards are added to the queue at one time,
and then all are resolved in order.
One of the earliest uses of a Rolling Queue is the 1965 game Nuclear War.
In this game, each player has a queue of two cards in front of them. On their
turn, they add a card to the end of the queue, and then turn up and execute
the card at the queue head. In Nuclear War the players start at peace and
may perform certain peace actions, but when someone launches a missile,
only war actions may be taken. The delayed Action Queue gives the game
tremendous tension, as players need to decide if they can continue to perform
peace actions or want to be the first to declare war.
RoboRally uses a Batch Queue. The players fully plan an entire series of
actions and then resolve them using an Interleaved turn structure, with each
player revealing and performing the action in the first slot, then each player
doing the second action, etc. Swashbuckler, instead of cards, has players record
their actions in blocks of six time steps on a record sheet. Players then resolve
each time step in a similar way.
Robo Rally only allows for the players to queue Movement actions, with
others (like shooting) being done on-the-fly as the opportunity permits. In
contrast, Swashbuckler allows players a full suite of movement, combat, and
other actions.
Twin Tin Bots uses a Batch Queue approach, but the entire queue does
not get replaced at once. Players may only replace one Action in the queue
each turn. The others remain and are performed. This obviously adds more
complexity to the programming step as players need to play further ahead
about how they may change of their queues. Mechs vs. Minions is a similar
example of this system.
When queues get longer, and particularly when movement and rotation
actions are included in the available actions, this mechanism may require
good spatial relations in the players, as they need to visualize where they will
be as they progress through the queue. This can give games a heavier feel,
while at the same time increasing the chaotic feel. This combination may not
be well received by some players, although some games, like Robo Rally and
Space Alert, rely on this for their experience.
Other games, like Colt Express, address this challenge by limiting the
overall movement space. In Colt Express players can move to the head or rear
of a short train of cars, or between the inside and the top of those cars. Each
player can move to one of three spaces per turn, and the whole board is about
ten spaces (depending on player count), increasing the likelihood of player
collisions and interactions.

Root has a unique take on the Action Queue, as one of the factions must
add a new Action to the queue each turn (in any position) and perform all the
Actions in sequence. If an Action cannot be executed, the player loses victory
points, and all Action cards are discarded. Another variation is in Valparaiso.
Players simultaneously plan their actions in a queue, and then execute them in
order. However, as the turn unfolds they may pay gold to perform an action
in their queue sooner than planned.

Shared Action Queue

Description
All players add Actions to a central Action Queue. Actions in the Queue are
performed by all players.

Discussion
This is a variation on the standard Action Queue mechanism. Here, on their
turn a player adds one or more Actions to the end of a queue shared by all
players, and then executes the full queue from start to finish. This system
increases interactivity, as players are planning actions not just for themselves,
but also for their opponents. It gives a different flavor of strategic options,
as players attempt to plan actions that will benefit them more than their
opponents. Sequencing may also play a role, as the action queue may not set
up certain players to perform actions as they may be out of position for an
earlier action, a deficiency that cascades throughout the queue.
The two-player game Major General: Duel of Time takes this a step further
by including two actions on each card played, one for each player. It is also
unique in that actions may be placed anywhere in the queue, not just at the
end. After playing an action, the player executes actions from the end of the
queue closest to them. On their opponent’s turn, they will resolve the actions
in the opposite order, and using the other actions on the cards.

86

Each turn in Mottainai a player plays a card in front of them that allows
the taking of a particular action. However, before performing it the player
first performs the actions in front of each opponent, going clockwise and
ending with themselves. This is similar to Follow (ACT-08), except that the
opponent’s chosen actions are executed on your turn, not on the opponent’s
turn.
A variation on a Shared Action Queue is used in Kraftwagen, which has
a queue of action tokens, trailed by a queue of player markers. The person at
the end of the queue may move to any position to take and execute an Action.
However, the further ahead the person moves, the longer it will be until they
are once again at the end, and in position to take a new action. Kraftwagen
blends a Shared Action Queue with a Time Track (TRN-13).

Follow

Description
One player selects an Action. Other players may then perform that Action,
or a modified version of it. This is closely related to Action Drafting (ACT02) and Role Selection (TRN-10), and is often implemented alongside those
systems.

Discussion
Follow mechanisms are a form of Action Selection that have a high degree
of player involvement. Puerto Rico is a good example. On their turn, a player
selects one of the available roles, and executes the action associated with it.
Then, in turn, each player gets to execute the role. The player who selected
the role also gets a bonus to their action. For example, the player who selects
Builder gets a discount on the cost of construction and performs the action
first. The other players then each perform the Builder action, paying the
normal cost.
This mechanism forces players to consider not just what they want to do,
but what will be good for their opponents. Does someone really need to build?
Perhaps picking Builder is not the best choice. Can someone only build if they
get the discount? Then selecting Builder, even if it helps other players too, may

88

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

be the best option. Players need to look holistically at everyone’s position, not
just their own.
A variation on this mechanism can be found in Glory to Rome and SPQF.
In these games, Actions are taken by playing a card from the hand, which are
in certain suits. Other players may echo the action if they play one or more
cards matching the suit. In this way, the players that are echoing may end up
performing more powerful versions of the actions by discarding several cards.
It also means that if players cannot match the action, they may not echo it.
Since players’ hands are hidden in these games, this makes determining the
best option somewhat of a guessing game. But careful attention will show
what may be useful to other players, and what cards they may have collected.
Follow systems of this sort introduce a cost to the follow action. In Eminent
Domain, players may Follow by discarding cards of the same suit, which
further power the action. Because the game is a deck-builder, the cards spent
from hand are only an opportunity cost, as they will eventually be shuffled
back into the player’s deck. In Tiny Epic Galaxies, players must spend a
Culture resource to follow, which is a more concrete cost.
In Mottainai, players, on their turn, may perform the actions that the
other players played on their prior turn. Unlike other Follow mechanism
implementations, this one calls for a batch execution of the sequence of
actions, rather than an Interleaved system.
Generally, Follow systems are excellent at keeping players engaged on every
turn, since players act, or have potential to act, on every turn. However, they
may also slow down play, since players have to decide on every single turn
whether they wish to Follow and how. Designers are encouraged to include
some physical token to keep track of who the active player is, too, since the
interleaving of player actions inside each active player’s turn can lead to turnorder confusion.

Order Counters

Description
Players place Order Tokens into regions, indicating what they want to do
in that particular region of the board. After all tokens are placed, they are
executed in sequence.

Discussion
This mechanism combines an Interleaved Turn Structure (TRN-15) with
an Action Queue. Players are in essence creating multiple Interleaved Action
Queues during a planning step, and then resolving them. The tokens are
typically placed face down, so opponents know where you are planning to do
actions, but not which, and if more than one order may be given, tokens are
placed in a stack to indicate their sequence.
Because players alternate placing orders into different areas, they must
balance a variety of factors. Which actions do they wish to do early? Will
committing to a region alert an opponent to your intentions to operate there?
What action are the opponents planning?
The resolution of the Order Token stacks can be performed in several
ways. First, they may either be resolved from the top down, so that tokens
that were placed last are resolved first (LIFO: Last-In-First-Out), or the token

90

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

stack may be flipped over, so that the earliest tokens are resolved first (FIFO:
First-In-First-Out). Some games (like A Game of Thrones: The Board Game),
don’t consider the placement order of the tokens, and simply turn them all
over and resolve them in a specific Action order.
Resolution order has great impact on the strategy and feel for placement.
LIFO gives the game a “chicken” feel, as players want to be the last into a
region with key actions so that they are executed first, but it also increases
cognitive load, as players need to remember the reverse order of tokens in the
stack and modify their plans as they go. With a FIFO structure, players can
gradually just build up their plans in their minds as they proceed, which is
less cognitively taxing.
Either way, this is a moderately complex mechanism which is best reserved
for heavier strategy games.

Rondel

Description
The available Actions are represented as pie wedges in a circle. Each player
has one or more tokens on Rondel’s wedges. On their turn, they may move
their token around the Rondel and perform the Action indicated by the wedge
where they stop. It is typically more costly to move further around the Rondel.

Discussion
This mechanism is related to a basic Action Point system (ACT-01), as the
Rondel represents a menu of available actions. However, the cost of the actions
varies for each turn, as to move more than one space typically incurs some
cost (money or some other currency). If a player wishes to move one space at
a time, they incur little cost, but may not be most efficiently performing the
actions.
Rondel systems emphasize trade-offs, planning, and efficiency, as players
need to balance taking the action that they want to do now, and paying a
cost, with waiting and paying no or a reduced cost.
There are several variations on this mechanic. In Finca, players have several
tokens on the Rondel, and may choose one of them to move. The distance
that it may move is based on the number of tokens in the starting wedge, and
the power of the action is determined by the number of tokens in the ending
wedge. This makes for a highly interactive yet relatively simple system, and
also begins to blur with a Mancala mechanism (MOV-12).

Action Selection Restrictions

Description
Players are restricted from which actions they may choose.

Discussion
There are a wide variety of mechanisms that have been used to force players
to choose less than optimal actions, or even ones that are detrimental. Some
of the more popular mechanisms have been included in their own section:
Action Drafting, Action Retrieval, Rondels, and Command Cards are all
examples. However, there are a wide variety of approaches to this that have
been used in only one game. Several of these are collected in this section.
In Kemet, the possible actions are laid out in a pyramid. Players must select
at least one option from each pyramid level. In Goa, action tiles are laid out
on a grid. The start player places a marker on the grid, taking that tile. Each
player in turn then places their marker adjacent to the previous one played,
onto another tile, either orthogonally or diagonally. Players need to consider
how they may be helping their opponent by placing next to a tile they need.
In Noria, players place action tokens on concentric wheels. Only tokens in
certain portions of the wheels may be used, and the wheels rotate at different
speeds. Tzolk’ in: The Mayan Calendar also uses rotating gears, and the longer
workers remain on the gears the more powerful actions they can perform. In
Calimala, players place discs between two actions on a grid, and can perform
both connected actions.
Manitoba has a tower of discs of different colors, and the active player
selects part of the stack which controls what map regions and tracks may be
used for actions.

94

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

In Keyforge: Call of the Archons, each turn a player picks what “house”
they will use, and only cards (actions) that belong to that house may be used.
Looking for novel ways to limit the actions that players can take is a constant
source of innovation in game design.
Warpgate gives players a hand of Action cards, each of which has two
possible Actions that can be performed. When playing a card, the player may
select which half to use. It has the additional twist that cards become more
powerful the later they are played in the round.

Variable Player Powers

Description
Each player has special Actions that only he or she can perform, or that
modify standard actions.

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanic that can modify Action and other systems, like
Resolution. We are placing it here, as it can typically give players additional
actions that they can perform or it modifies standard actions or procedures.
Typically, each player has a unique player power that sets them apart from
the other players. This is an excellent way to include asymmetry, as well as
emphasize theme, as in Dune, where the factions are highly differentiated
through different actions and abilities and are quite evocative of the source
material. For example, the Fremen faction, who reside on the planet, can
build units anywhere, and are better able to deal with the hazards on the
planet. The Guild faction, which controls all space travel, gains money each
time a non-Fremen player moves forces to the planet surface.
Variable Player Powers also improve replayability, as players will want to
return to the game to try out different factions and see how they play, and in
some cases this will feel like a completely different game.
These unique powers also increase complexity and cognitive load on the
players, however. In addition to the standard rules, the special exceptions for

96

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

each player need to be taught. The most successful of games where Player
Powers are at the forefront are based on very simple frameworks. Cosmic
Encounter is all about the player powers, and they can radically change the way
players play the game. The simple structure of Cosmic Encounter is an excellent
example. Combat is resolved by each player playing a number card, and adding
the number of tokens they have in the battle. Highest number wins. That
simple framework allows the designers to take the special powers in a dizzying
array of different directions. The designer has reserved most of the design space
in this mechanism for the interactions of the unique player powers.
Another feature of player powers is that they may make a particular
strategy optimal for that player. For example, a faction may be very good at
fighting, which will encourage a military strategy. This can be positive, as it
gives players an identity and immediate strategic direction for new players.
But it also limits players’ strategic choices, and they can feel as if there is one
“correct” way to play for a faction.
There are several options for conveying the details of a Variable Player
Power to the players. One is to state the rules explicitly through a player mat
or shield, as in Cosmic Encounter or Spirit Island, where they are all clearly
presented to the player at the start of the game through a player mat or limited
number of cards. Alternately, they can be spread out amongst a large number
of components, typically a deck of cards, such as in Sentinels of the Multiverse.
The advantage of the latter is that it makes it simpler to teach, as the base
rules are the same for all, and the differences only need to be taught when
they arise. It also gives the players a sense of discovery, as they see cards and
abilities they did not know existed.
On the negative side, this can make it difficult for new players to take full
advantage of a specific character, and so may lead to an unsatisfactory initial
play with a specific faction or character.

Once-Per-Game Abilities

Description
Players have a special ability that they can use one time per game.

Discussion
While there are exceptions, Once-Per-Game Abilities are usually different
for each player or character. Because they can only be performed once, the
designer has great latitude to make them very powerful.
These two characteristics combine to make this mechanism potentially be
player- or character-defining. The threat of using the ability, the decision of
when to actually use it, and identifying the correct moment can dominate
the play of the game as players maneuver for advantage, and can elevate
the strategy and tactics. It also adds another dimension of consideration
for players—timing—that is not present with always-on special abilities.
In Warmachine/Hordes, each side has one Warcaster who has an extremely
powerful single-use ability called a Feat. When and how to use the Feat is a
critical part of the game. As such, when characters have wildly varying special
abilities as in Warmachine/Hordes, it is important that players understand
exactly what their opponents are capable of doing. This rewards veteran

98

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

players and puts a burden on new players to understand the full extent of the
special Action.
Some games give players a set of special action tokens at the start of the
game, which are usable one time during the game. These may be the same for
each player, like Finca. Often, if tokens are not used, they give bonus Victory
Points to the player at the end of the game.

Advantage Token

Description
One player has a token that permits them to do a special Action, or modify
an Action. Once used, the token passes to another player.

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanism of Action Selection, as it determines what Actions
may be available to a player. Originally introduced in the 1981 game Storm
Over Arnhem as the “Tactical Advantage” token, it represents the ebb and
flow of a conflict. In Storm, the controlling player could use it to re-resolve
a combat, or to force a turn to continue when it would otherwise end. After
being used in this way, it is passed to the other player, who receives the same
options.
This introduces another consideration for the player, as the value of using
the Tactical Advantage must be weighed against its loss and the possible use
of it by the opponent. Similar to Once-Per-Game Actions (ACT-13), a timing
dimension is added to the decision-making. Normally, Variable Player Powers
(ACT-12) are always on, so if you can use them, you should. But that is not
the case with this mechanism.

100

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Twilight Struggle uses this mechanism more thematically than Storm Over
Arnhem, in the guise of The China Card, an actual card that is passed between
players when it is used. It is a powerful card that is even more powerful when
used to perform actions in Asia, but after use it is given to the opponent.
Again, consideration must be given to timing, and whether to use the card or
simply hold on to it and deny its use to the opponent.
Advantage Tokens can also be used to give ongoing benefits to the
owning player that do not require surrender. In Storm, for example, the
player controlling the token gets to go first in a turn, and decides the order of
resolution of conflict situations.
Many games use this system less overtly for tie-breaking. In a Sealed Bid
Auction for example (AUC-04), ties may be broken by a Priority Token.
Then, the token is given to the player who lost the tie-breaker. This is different
than the standard sense of this mechanism, as the transfer is not typically
controlled by the player. It simply designates who wins a tie, and its transfer
is never a choice. In another variant of this mechanism, the A Game of Thrones
board game features an Iron Throne token that is awarded to the winner of
the turn-order auction. The holder of the Throne determines how all noncombat ties among all players are to be decided. The recurring turn-order
auction is the means by which possession of the token moves around, rather
than by its use.
The Advantage Token mechanism gives the designer an opportunity to
give the players more control over certain random aspects of the game, such as
combat resolution in Storm Over Arnhem or card draw in Twilight Struggle. As
such, it can make a game feel more strategic, without a lot of rules overhead.

Gating and Unlocking

Description
At certain points in the game, different actions are made available to the
players. Actions may become available by a variety of means, including
reaching a certain turn or game stage. Depleting a shared pool or bringing
some track past a threshold level through the cumulative effects of the actions
of all the players is another common approach to triggering unlocks.

102

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanism of Action Selection, as it affects the availability of
Actions, rather than how they are selected. It may be used with any of the
Action Selection mechanism.
These new Actions can introduce new resources, give better or more
efficient options than the older spaces, and introduce completely new
mechanics. Agricola does all three of these. After each round, a new Action
card is added to the game board. Some of these introduce new resources, such
as Cattle or Boar, some give more of a resource per space, and others introduce
a completely new Action, such as Family Growth.
Adding more actions as the game progresses can be used by the designer to
control complexity. Early in the game, actions can be simple and limited, giving
the players a chance to understand the system without being overwhelmed. As
the game progresses, more complex actions and combos can be introduced.
Good candidates for this may be actions that are difficult or impossible to
perform early in the game anyway or are tactically improper. This helps give
players a positive first experience.
In addition to controlling complexity, adding actions also gives a sense of
forward momentum and narrative arc. New options are introduced to the
players, giving the game a progressively more advanced feel as it goes. Adding
spaces that give more resources, or allow earlier actions to be performed more
efficiently, adds a sense of acceleration.
The 18xx series of railroad games, such as 1830, has a strong gating system
that is a critical part of player strategy. Trains must be bought in order of
power. As certain train levels are exhausted, a variety of game effects are
triggered. Upgraded and more powerful track tiles become available, and
certain older trains disappear. Understanding and predicting the timing of
these transitions is a critical skill in 18xx games and is one of the reasons they
are unforgiving for new players, as these transitions accelerate as the game
progresses, so timing can be tricky.
Similarly, Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization has the players progress
through a variety of Age decks, with upgraded technologies, abilities, and
leaders. As each deck is exhausted, players need to discard cards from older
ages and reduce their population. Like 1830, the timing and anticipation
of these transitions becomes a skill for players to master. SpaceCorp also has
three Ages (called Eras), but the transition is more extreme as each is played
on a completely separate board, with only some advantages carrying over
from one to the next.

Tech Trees/Tech Tracks/Track Bonuses

Description
During the course of the game, new Actions become available to specific
players, or existing Actions are improved.

Discussion
This is similar in many ways to the meta-mechanism of Gating and Unlocking
(ACT-15). New actions and abilities are introduced as the game progresses.
The differences in this mechanism are subtle but important. First, these
new and upgraded Actions are typically only available to a single player. It
is possible that multiple players can earn the same additional Action, but it
needs to happen individually.
Some games allow other players to take advantage of another’s personal
Actions, either by paying the owning player some fee, obtaining the ability

Actions

105

by force or trade, or by having the owner’s monopoly on them expire after a
number of turns, making them available to all.
These upgrades frequently do not make entirely new Actions available to a
player. Instead, they make specific Actions more efficient or powerful.
Whereas Gated upgrades typically are triggered on a timed or global
schedule (as in Agricola’s one new Action space per turn system), in a
Tech system players need to accumulate and spend some resource in
order to gain them. This can be a general currency, such as money, as in
Civilization, or a specialized “research” currency as in Eclipse or Through
the Ages: A Story of Civilization. There are games where techs are given
out freely, although these still have an opportunity cost as players must
forgo other choices.
Technologies do not have to be themed as research to use the mechanism.
In many games, hiring people, or building certain structures unlocks
new or advanced abilities. Puerto Rico is one of many examples of this.
Growing, evolving, building, and training are other common metaphors
for research.
Upgrades may have prerequisites that need to be satisfied, or may be easier
to obtain if you have an earlier tech. This results in a Tech Tree. For example,
in Stellar Conquest, if you have researched Industrial Technology, it is less
costly to then obtain Robotic Industry.
Tech Trees may also be expressed as Tracks. As players advance their
marker along one or more tracks, they may pass certain spaces, which gives
improved actions or abilities. Orleans and Russian Railroads both utilize
this mechanism. There may also be physical markers placed along these
tracks, so that the first player to reach those spaces gains those markers
and a special bonus. Other players will still receive bonuses printed on the
track.
Tech Trees may be disguised thematically. In Titan, players recruit creatures
into legions. The creatures that may be recruited into a legion depend on its
current composition. Three Ogres may recruit a Troll, and three Trolls may
recruit a Colossus. These creatures are more and more powerful, and some
have special abilities like flying.
This type of system gives the designer fine-grained control over
Actions available to players, and gives a path to offer different strategic
options, as players can choose which Actions and Abilities to invest in.
Having a limited number of these Techs also forces player interaction and
competition.

Events

Description
Actions occur outside the control of players that cause an immediate effect,
change the state of the game, or impact subsequent actions.

Discussion
Events can add variety and theme to a game. Many gamers’ first exposure
to events comes through Monopoly, in the form of Chance and Community
Chest cards. These may immediately affect one or more players. This type of
event is also found in Empire Builder, a railroad building game where cards
may cause derailments, or floods wipe out tracks crossing rivers.
However, their usefulness is multiplied by affecting the overall game
state for an extended period of time. Other events in Empire Builder may
cause blizzards, which affect train movement near mountains, or storms that
affect certain regions. This forces players to reevaluate their plans to try to
avoid or take advantage of the changed circumstances. Sometimes this can
be interesting for the players, but if it is too random and negative it can feel
punishing.
Events can also affect the global game state. In Evo, the overall temperature
is of critical importance to which dinosaurs will be able to survive. Each
turn, a die is rolled to determine how the temperature changes. The new
environment is in effect globally and affects all players. Similarly, in night
missions in earlier editions of Warhammer 40,000 dice are rolled each turn
to determine how far units can see.

Core Worlds: Galactic Orders delays the implementation of Events. Each
round an Event is drawn, and all players can see what it is. However, it does not
go into effect until the end of the round. This gives all players an opportunity
to adjust to take advantage. Events in Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the
Cursed Island have an immediate effect and may further impact play unless
the players address them in some way over several turns.
Terra Mystica gives players broader visibility to an Event of a sort—random
scoring tiles. At the start of the game, tiles are placed that show what will
give bonus points for each round. Players can see what is coming up and plan
their strategy accordingly.
A delayed Event mechanism is used in Through the Ages: A Story of
Civilization. In this game, players play Event cards into a stack that may, for
example, give a bonus to the player with the strongest military. While the
player who added that card to the stack knows it will be drawn in the future,
the way that the events are played from stacks makes it very uncertain how
many turns it will be before it is drawn. While a player may have had the
strongest military when he or she played the event into the stack, he or she
may not by the time it is actually drawn.

Narrative Choice

Description
Multiple action options are presented to the players via a narrative format.

Discussion
With the rise of Dungeons & Dragons in the 1970s, game designers looked
for new ways to incorporate storytelling into game design. One of the earliest
to do this was the late-1970s Choose Your Own Adventure book series, which
began with The Cave of Time. In this series, at the end of short chapters, the
reader would be presented with a series of choices, which would lead to other
pages, and ultimately a good or bad conclusion.
This system has been adopted as part of more traditional tabletop games,
with an early example being Tales of the Arabian Nights. In this game, after
moving to a space, players are directed to read a numbered paragraph in
a large book to reveal what adventure the character is experiencing. These
vignettes offer choices of actions for the players, for example, “Bribe the
Guard” or “Fight Your Way In.” These lead to other numbered paragraphs,
which give the result, and their impact on the game state.
Frequently, these systems use Stat Checks (RES-02) to determine the
outcome. For example, if you choose to “Fight Your Way In,” you may need
to make a check against Strength or some other ability. Then, the paragraph
will tell you to proceed to different paragraphs depending on the outcome.
Sometimes, not all the actions will be available to you, unless you previously
found some item, or built up some stat to a sufficient level.

110

The strength of this mechanism is in the ability to bring more structured
narrative and flavor to the game, without the players needing to create
narrative from abstract game elements. However, the weakness of Narrative
Choice systems is that the adventures they present can be disconnected from
the main course of the game, and thus can lack context. Arabian Nights
ties the adventure to the player through the use of different environments
(sea, desert, etc.), and player status (married, despondent, cursed) that impact
the adventures. But the adventures themselves do not combine into a single
coherent narrative.
Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game attempts to deal with this contextual
issue by the Crossroads mechanism. The player to the right of the active
player draws a Crossroads card that applies to that turn. It begins with an
action trigger, such as entering a certain location, which is not revealed to
the phasing player. If the player takes the trigger action, the Crossroads
card holder interrupts the action, and presents the mini-adventure to the
player. This means that the game designer can write an adventure knowing,
for example, that it will specifically take place at a certain location. This
mechanism has two different implementations that are worth noting. In the
tabletop version, the Crossroads cards were written so that players were told
what the outcome of each choice would be prior to making the choice. In
the digital implementation, the outcome of each choice is hidden from the
players. This is another example of input vs. output randomness, but in the
context of making a meaningful narrative choice, hiding the mechanical,
in-game outcomes creates a more character-driven experience.
Games like Ambush! and Action Castle maintain narrative cohesion at the
expense of replayability. In these games, players are presented with specific
triggers or situations. For example, in Ambush!, moving into a specific space
during a certain stage of the mission will always trigger the same paragraph
to be read. Action Castle emulates computer adventure games, and has players
interact with the game via short phrases (like “take sword”), but the same
phrases will always work in the same situation.
Other games strive to maintain cohesion by locking narrative choices so
they only appear at specified times. In Near and Far, some of the narrative
passages are tied to the game’s campaign mode, to preserve a more cohesive
story. Risk Legacy uses a gating mechanism (see “ACT-15” in this chapter) to
ensure that specific story beats are only revealed once players have progressed
the campaign sufficiently to make the story fit.
Legacy of Dragonholt, a role-playing-style game (RPG), is built nearly
entirely on the Narrative Choice mechanism. A tracker sheet for both the

Actions

111

characters and the scenario allows for lots of stat-checking to determine
progress. Scenarios often come with a map of areas to visit. Each area, when
visited, will have different options open to the players based on a few factors.
If you come to a store at night, the store will be closed. If you go to market
on market day, there will be lots to explore. In addition to tracking time of
day and day of the week, players also track when they complete specific story
points, as instructed by the game book. These story points create a kind of
memory for the system, so options presented to players may depend on their
having marked a specific story point. If, for example, the innkeeper goes
missing, the game will instruct players to mark, say, story point B7. Later
options might direct players to read different texts if point B7 is marked,
to ensure that there is story continuity and that the innkeeper who went
missing isn’t behind the bar the next morning. Legacy of Dragonholt shares
more in common with pencil-and-paper interactive fiction books than with
traditional tabletop board games, but it is an excellent example of how flexible
the Narrative Choice mechanism can be.

Resolution

ӶӶ
In Chapter 3, we discussed Actions and the different ways that players can
choose or plan Actions. Sometimes, the outcome of an Action is specific and
definite. No chance is involved. For example, in Chess, if you take the Action
of moving your Knight forward, it will happen exactly as you plan.
However, some Actions have uncertain outcomes. Some are related to
performative uncertainty, as in a dexterity game, where you may not succeed
in performing your planned action. Others relate to chance interfering with
your plans, which we call Output Randomness (see Chapter 6). For example,
in Risk, you may declare an attack on Kamchatka (the Action), but the result
of that Action is not known when it is declared. You may win without losing
a single army, lose all your armies, or some result in between.
Because Output Randomness is most often associated with conflict, many
of the examples here are from war or battle games. However, there are plenty
of Actions that require some form of resolution, such as trying to sell at a
market, finding a hidden object, upgrading a technology, or approving a
budget in a political-economic game. This chapter discusses different ways of
determining the outcomes of Actions.

RES-01

High Number

Description
Each player is represented by a numeric “strength,” and the higher strength
wins the conflict.

Discussion
This is a basic and common way of resolving conflicts. The base strength can
be represented by a fixed value for the piece, as in Magic: The Gathering, or by
the position on the board, as in Cosmic Encounter, where each defending token
adds 1 to the total defender strength. Sometimes, strengths may be determined
randomly. In War, players flip cards to compare strengths. Many games include
a “roll-off” mechanism, where each player rolls a die, and the high roll wins the
contest.
Frequently, base strength can be modified by some factor. In Magic: The
Gathering, there are a variety of cards that impact the Power and Toughness
of creatures (comparable to an Attack and Defense strength). In Cosmic
Encounter, each player secretly plays a number card which is added to the
number of tokens on their side, including allies.
Modifiers need to be carefully considered by the designer. Their inclusion
increases the complexity of the resolution, particularly if they come from
multiple sources. For example, a game may grant the defenders a +2 modifier
because they are defending in the mountains, and a −1 modifier because they
are infantry defending against artillery. While the math seems simple, having
a long list of modifiers for the players to apply can be burdensome. It is better
to have these factored into intrinsic strengths, or through card play or dice
pools whose outcomes model the probabilities desired.
The dungeon-crawler Descent: Journeys in the Dark uses a High Number
mechanism combined with a Dice Pool. The characters, weapons, and
situation add or remove dice from the attacker’s and defender’s pools. They

Resolution

115

then each roll their dice, and count hits (for the attacker) or shields (for the
defender). The higher number prevails. If the hits exceed the shields, the
defender takes damage based on the difference.
This attrition-style mechanism, where damage is caused based on the delta
between the final strengths, is common. A less common alternative is Winner
Takes All, where the losing side is completely eliminated at no cost to the
winner. The game 4000 AD implements this mechanism, which can lead to
tension and wide swings, as a 10-strength fleet will completely eliminate both
a 1- and 9-strength fleet at no loss to itself. The lack of realism can impact
theme and immersion.
An Ordered High Number system is used in the Risk series of games. In
these games, Attacker and Defender typically roll multiple dice. The highest
roll of the Attacker is compared to the highest of the Defender, second-highest
Attacker roll to second-highest Defender roll, etc. Because of the simultaneous
ordering of the rolls from highest to lowest, this system has lower variance
than just making N independent rolls. It also offers a much simpler way to
give an advantage to the player with greater numbers without resorting to
modifiers. If a player has a 3:1 numerical advantage, they simply roll three
dice versus the opponent’s one, which is much simpler than gaining modifiers
to the die roll.
An interesting twist on this system is to switch whether the high or low
number is the winner within the same game. For example, in Battleball, a
simulation of futuristic football, players are represented by different size dice—
six-sided, eight-sided, twelve-sided, or twenty-sided. When moving, rolling
higher is better. High rolls allow a player to move farther. The D20 wide
receivers are great at dashing down the field. The D6 linesmen are much less
mobile. But when trying to tackle, both players roll their die against each other,
but now the low number wins. So, linesmen will usually tackle wide receivers.
However, this system leaves open the possibility for surprises in both running
and tackling.
In numeric comparison systems, some means to deal with ties needs to
be included. In combat simulations, these ties typically are awarded to the
defender; however, any tie-breaking mechanism can be used.
High Number and Stat Check mechanisms can be combined for a more
nuanced mechanism. See the Stat Check section for more details.

Stat Check

Description
There is a target number required to succeed at some test. A random number
is generated (by card draw, die roll, etc.), which is compared to the target. If
it meets or exceeds the target, the action succeeds.

Discussion
This mechanism goes by a variety of names, including Task Check, Skill
Check, and others. It is commonly used in role-playing games (RPGs), such
as Dungeons & Dragons, where a player makes a roll against a stat or target
number. Typically, if it is lower than the target, the action succeeds.
Stat Check is frequently used in battle games, like Axis & Allies, where
each type of unit has a target number that it is trying to meet or exceed to
score a hit. Warhammer uses a similar system with six-sided dice, and rates
units as, for example, 2+, 3+, or 4+, if it needs to roll a 2 or higher, 3 or
higher, or 4 or higher. The group of minis (or single mini) is then rated for
how many dice it gets to roll. One attack may be rolling 8 dice for a 4+, and
another might be 5 dice for a 3+. Target numbers may be modified based
on characteristics of the defender, such as terrain, or special armor, but the
rolls are typically not opposed by the defender, as in the High Number
Mechanism. The defender may get to respond, but as a separate check. For
example, in Warhammer, defending figures may be able to cancel hits by
making a Saving Roll of 3+. Performing a series of Stat Checks lengthens

118

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

the game, but also increases tension and can simplify the rules as modifiers
and other effects are localized.
Some games keep the target number the same but differentiate units by
the type of dice rolled. For example, in the 1986 Fortress America, the target
number is always a “5” or greater. But some units roll a six-sided die, some an
eight-sided die, and others a ten-sided die. This makes it easier for the player
to perform combat, as there is only one target number to remember.
In the 2012 reprint, this was simplified further by simply having “hit” or
“miss” symbols on the relevant dice, so only two sides of the six-sided die have
the Hit symbol, but four sides of the eight-sided die do. While this system
was a visual improvement, it was more opaque as to the strengths of the dice.
Players would have to examine all sides of the dice and memorize their odds,
which was fiddlier than with the target number system.
Some games combine a Stat Check with a High Score system. One example
is the miniatures game Infinity. The Infinity mechanism has each player trying
to roll below their stat using a 20-sided die, but higher than their opponent.
For example, let’s say two units are shooting at each other, and one has a skill
of 17, and the other a skill of 12. First, a player is only eligible to hit if they
roll less than or equal to their target. If only one player succeeds on the Stat
Check, that player hits their opponent. If both miss, then there is no effect.
If both hit, then the player with the higher roll (but still below the target)
succeeds and the other fails. Combining systems like this gives a compact and
fluid method for a variety of results.
Stat Checks can incorporate modifiers. The same considerations that are
discussed in High Number apply here.

Critical Hits and Failures

Description
Dice are rolled, and those exceeding a target number generate a success.
Certain rolls (typically the highest and/or lowest on the die) generate
additional success or extreme failure.

Discussion
Critical Hits (and Critical Failures) add variance to a resolution system, in essence
lengthening the “tail” of the result distribution. They also add excitement by
creating jackpot effects, similar to a slot machine. You have a pretty good idea
of what the result range may be, but Critical Hits and Failures, depending on
implementation, can give bonuses that make success possible where it normally
might not be, or add tension to an overwhelming attack.
In its standard implementation, Critical Hits double the damage of an
attack, or improve the result in other ways. However, there are several novel
uses of Critical results.
Uncharted Seas and Dystopian Wars, miniatures games from Spartan
Games, have an “exploding dice” critical system. In this system, players roll
a number of six-sided dice, and get a success on a 4 or higher. On a roll of a
6, however, the player gets two successes, and also gets to reroll those dice.
Additional 6s on the rerolls will yield additional double-successes and more
rerolls. In this system, it is theoretically possible to get any number of hits
on any attack, which can make for dramatic moments as dice are rolled and
rerolled, and successes accumulate.

120

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Warmachine/Hordes allows for a critical hit any time at least two dice in an
attack show the same result. Normally an attack is made with two dice, but
this number may be increased or decreased, naturally changing the frequency
of critical hits or removing their possibility (as in the case of a one-die attack)
without any additional rules overhead.
Advanced Squad Leader generates extra effects (both positive and negative)
on rolls of 2 or 12 on two six-sided dice. A 2 causes a Heat of Battle effect,
which may cause a hero to emerge, a unit to upgrade, or the squad to go
berserk and charge the enemy; a 12 may cause weapons to break or other
negative results, resolved by rolling on a separate chart (RES-04). These
add a lot of variety to combat results and force players to adapt to changing
circumstances.
Several games convert special symbols or excess successes (if rolling against
a target) into a type of currency that can be spent on various beneficial effects.
Sometimes called Surges, these can also give a lot of tools to the player to use
tactically, beyond simply resolving the combat. The miniatures game Malifaux
adapts this by using a card flipping system to generate random combat
strengths, but allowing special abilities to trigger if the correct suit flips.

Ratio/Combat Results Table

Description
The Attacker and Defender each total their strength. This is then expressed as
a ratio and is used to index into a Combat Results Table (CRT). A dice roll
then determines the result of the conflict.

Discussion
Pioneered in the earliest war games, the CRT has become a staple of the genre.
CRTs are typically indexed by calculating the ratio of the attacker’s strength
to the defender’s. For example, if the attacker has a strength of 8, and the
defender a strength of 4, the 2:1 column would be used, as 8 is two times 4.
Typically, these are rounded down in favor of the defender, so a 9–4 attack
would also be resolved on the 2:1 column.
Once the correct column is determined, a die is rolled to determine the final
result. In war games, this is typically some combination of force eliminations,
damage, or retreats.

122

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

The use of the CRT gives the designer a lot of control over potential results.
It is possible to have a tightly grouped range of outcomes from 1 to 6, or a wild
variation. In addition, the designer has many hooks to apply other effects.
For example, the attacker or defender strength can be modified, the final die
roll can be modified, or the column used can be shifted left or right. This
flexibility has led to its continued popularity in the wargaming community.
Designs have taken the CRT in a wide variety of directions. Squad Leader
eschews strength ratios, and simply has the column chosen by the firepower
of the attacker. It also includes a mechanism called Cowering, where if
doubles are rolled (two dice are rolled in Squad Leader), the column used is
shifted one to the left, to a weaker column. Elite troops are typically immune
to Cowering. This is a good example of the opportunities CRTs offer to
differentiate and apply various effects.
Some games have the column selected by a differential between Attacker
and Defender rather than a ratio. This has the benefit of simplicity, as division
can be confusing when the strengths get large. Differentials are less realistic,
however, as they will treat a 10–8 attack the same as a 3–1 attack. However,
if the values are bounded within a reasonable range, differential CRTs can
give a lighter feel.
Some games use charts with various conditions as the columns to resolve
Actions and random events. Down with the King has charts that players roll on
to determine the result. For example, there are separate charts for Gambling,
Seducing, and Carousing. The solitaire game B-17: Queen of the Skies includes
charts for damage from German fighters, bombing accuracy, and the result
of crew member injuries.
While charts can encapsulate a large amount of information and give a lot
of flexibility to the designer, they can be intimidating to players and tedious
to use, and are considered old-fashioned. However, in the right situations,
they can be quite useful.

Die Icons

Description
The player rolls a number of dice. Any die showing the target icon is a
success.

Discussion
This mechanism is typically a subset of High Number (RES-01) or Stat
Check (RES-02), as the number of successes ultimately reduces to one of
these. However, we are listing this as a separate mechanism due to some
subtleties in the implementation and player interaction.
The use of Die Icons has several advantages over traditional dice with
numbers on the sides. First, using an icon makes it simpler for players to
interpret the result, if they are properly chosen. Counting icons is inherently
simpler from a cognitive perspective than adding numbers or checking to see
if numbers on dice exceed certain values. This ease increases as the number
of dice rolled increases and is particularly true if the target value may vary
depending on the game situation. In this case, icons are easier to parse at a
glance, especially if they are thematic.

124

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

For example, contrast Warhammer with Memoir ’44. In Warhammer,
a player may roll four dice for an attack, looking for a 5 or higher for a
success (a 5+, in the parlance). After rolling, the player needs to look at the
dice, remembering the target number. Memoir ’44, like Warhammer, bases
the number of dice rolled on the nature of the attacking unit. The icon
that counts as a hit is based on what is being targeted. When attacking an
Infantry, each Infantry symbol counts as a hit. When attacking Armor, each
Armor symbol counts as a hit. In addition, the grenade icon always counts
as an additional hit. Since there are two infantry icons, one armor icon,
and one grenade icon on a die, an attack on infantry is equivalent to a 4+,
and an attack on armor a 5+. But the player does not need to have a chart
of those numbers or track them in any way. It is intuitively obvious to look
for the icons of what you are attacking, and just count them up. Advanced
players can understand the symbol distribution, but it is not necessary. The
die does the heavy lifting.
The distribution of icons also gives the designer fine-grained control over
possible combat outcomes and allows for multiple effects to be determined.
The Memoir ’44 dice also include a Retreat icon, which applies in conjunction
with the removal effects, allowing for a wide variety of outcomes.
A disadvantage of icons is that it is very difficult to deal with modifiers,
or other ways to modify attacks based on, for example, terrain, or different
quality forces.
Some games, like Descent, deal with this by having dice of different
qualities, relating to the power and skill of the character, weapon, armor, or
other equipment. The dice can be segregated into types like attack, defense,
knockback, special, and others, again allowing the designer fine-grained
control over possible outcomes while making it simple for the player to
interpret. They just need to see what color dice need to be rolled, and then
read off the icons to see the results.
Eclipse is a hybrid of this system, with three colors of dice representing
different powers—yellow (the weakest), orange, and red. However, Eclipse
does not use icons on the dice. Standard numeric pips are used, but with
non-standard distributions to model the varying power levels.
At the extreme end, Dragon Dice has custom dice for every single unit in
the game. The same effect can be represented by different icons for different
units. For example, Move icons may be boot prints for one creature and hoof
prints for another. Although it increases thematic immersion, having so many
icons can make it difficult for players to quickly parse results. It can also create
production challenges, and indeed, Quarriors!, the game that launched the

Resolution

125

concept of collectible dice games, struggled to find a publisher because of the
manufacturing challenge the game presented.
While they are most commonly used on dice, icons can be placed on cards
to be flipped for resolution as well. Similar considerations apply, except that
it is rare to have draws from multiple different decks the same way games like
Descent: Journeys in the Dark have players roll different dice.

Card Play

Description
Each player simultaneously or sequentially plays one or more cards. These modify
the base outcome of a conflict and allow various special abilities to apply.

Discussion
This resolution system places more control in the hands of the players. In
its simplest form, the player plays a number card to be added to the base
results, as in Cosmic Encounter. However, this can be taken in a wide variety
of directions to make combat more tactical.
Kemet resolves conflict by giving players a strength based on the units in
the battle. The players then each select a single Combat Card that modifies
the outcome. It has three values: strength bonus, shield value, and damage
caused. The strength bonus is added to the unit strength to determine the
victory, while the shield value and damage bonuses determine how many
opposing units are killed. Units are only removed based on those values, not
winning or losing the battle. Players may know they are most likely to lose,
and choose a Combat Card with little strength bonus, but high damage value,
so they destroy as many units as possible, possibly setting up for a counterattack, or even a Pyrrhic victory, should they succeed in eliminating all the
attacking forces. This type of counter-play leads to a lot of Yomi (UNC-01),
as players try to outguess their opponent’s intent.

Resolution

127

Kemet also has players exhaust Combat Cards that they use, plus one
additional card, in each battle. When all cards are exhausted, they are
recovered, similar to an Action Retrieval system (ACT-03). This gives players
more decisions to make and gives savvy players the opportunity to track
which Combat Cards may still be in play for their opponents.
A variety of other games allow players to play cards that modify the battle in
more extreme ways. Starship Samurai allows each player to include one battle card,
the effects of which may range from a simple strength addition, to the ability to
redeploy units into or out of the battle, changing the situation drastically. Magic:
The Gathering and other collectible card games (CCGs) use card-based Interrupts
(TRN-17) to allow for a wide variety of different effects.
Card systems can get quite complex. We the People has players draw a hand of
tactics cards to resolve battles, the size of which is based on a variety of factors,
including strength. Players then alternate playing or matching an opponent
play. The first player who is not able to match the opponent loses the battle, so
the player with more cards will typically win, but not always, and seizing the
ability to lead the card play becomes a critical tactic. In Starcraft: The Board
Game, players have a small hand of cards that have abilities that trigger based
on the units involved in the battle. As in We the People, players alternate card
play to gain an advantage. Starcraft allows players to purchase upgraded tech
cards to shuffle into their combat decks, but there is no guarantee they will be
available, leading to opportunities for bluffing (UNC-01).
The disadvantage of the more sophisticated card-based systems is that they
slow down play quite a bit as battles are resolved. In a two-player game,
this may not be an issue, but it is a consideration with higher player counts.
Nonetheless, these systems can offer enormous design opportunities, and the
ability to model a wide range of thematic moments and stratagems, as a play
of War of the Ring will demonstrate.

Rock, Paper, Scissors

Description
There are three possible options, and they are cyclically superior (A beats B,
B beats C, and C beats A).

Discussion
Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) is one of the core resolution mechanisms. Unlike
High Number or Stat Check, it is intransitive. A transitive relationship
means that if A beats B and B beats C, then A beats C. For example, simply
comparing strengths leads to a transitive relationship.
Adding intransitive elements to conflict resolution leads to interesting and
novel decisions for the players. For example, many Napoleonic wargames
treat the relationship between infantry, cavalry, and artillery as intransitive.
Infantry beats cavalry (defending in a square), cavalry beats artillery, and
artillery beats infantry. Note that “beats” in this context means “has an
advantage over.” It does not typically mean wins 100% of the time. Age of
Mythology: The Board Game is an example of this type of system.
There are a variety of ways to implement an RPS-based resolution system.
Some games, like Secret Labyrinth and Darkover, have players secretly select
one of three options (literally, RPS in the case of Secret Labyrinth), reveal,
and compare. Others will give bonuses or penalties to players based on their
choices, such as a modifier in a High Number system (RES-01), varying the
number of dice to be rolled, or changing or adding target icons.

Resolution

129

One system that is infrequently used is Intransitive Dice. In this
implementation, there are three different dice with varying values on the
faces. These are mathematically designed so that, on average, die A will roll
higher than die B, die B higher than die C, and die C higher than die A.
Typically the advantage is around 55–45, so it can be difficult to engineer a
dominant advantage, but over the course of many rolls the player that gets
the best matchups will come out ahead.
The RPS mechanism can also arise indirectly from the interaction of player
choices. For example, in Hoity Toity, players who go to the Auction House
may choose to play a Cash card, to buy an artifact; a Thief, to steal a Cash
card; or a Detective, to catch a Thief. Similarly, in Nobody But Us Chickens,
players can play a Chicken for points, a Fox to catch a Chicken, or a Dog to
catch a Fox. If there are more than three players, the interactions and choices
can get complex for players to decide, while being easy to resolve.
Hoity Toity has the additional wrinkle that if multiple players select Thief,
they cancel out, which has shades of the Prisoner’s Dilemma (RES-08) and
Sealed Bid with Cancellation (AUC-05).
Many games extend a hierarchical system by including a wrap-around
with the weakest piece defeating the strongest. For example, in Stratego, the
Marshall is the strongest piece, but it can be defeated by the Spy, the weakest.
Similarly, in Frank’s Zoo the Elephant is the strongest card, but it is defeated
by the Mouse. This adds a beneficial layer of uncertainty to these games.
Stratego without the possibility of losing your Marshall would be a much
poorer game.

Prisoner’s Dilemma

Description
Each player has a choice between Cooperating or Defecting. Total payoff
is maximized if both players Cooperate, but if one Defects and the other
Cooperates, the Defector will score more individual points.

Discussion
The Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) is one of the core Resolution mechanisms.
Players choose to either cooperate with each other, or defect. A typical payoff
chart is shown in the diagram above. Since the payoffs if both defect or both
cooperate are equivalent for both players, this system only works if there
are more than two players, even if only two are involved in the PD. If there
are only two players, neither gains ground if they select the same option, so
picking Defect is always the correct strategy.
As indicated by the traditional choice names of Cooperate and Defect,
the PD brings elements of trust to the forefront, and strong elements of Yomi

Resolution

131

(UNC-01). This can lead to emotional investment by the players, or reaction
to being betrayed, particularly in longer games where the outcome can have
a significant impact on player position.
An example of this is Diplomacy, a 6–8 hour game of conquest in Europe.
The players representing Austria and Italy start with two key spaces and
armies, Venice and Trieste, adjacent to each other at the start of the game, the
only such situation among the seven players. In Diplomacy, players write down
orders and reveal them simultaneously (TRN-09, for more on Simultaneous
Action Selection). After the initial negotiation phase, Italy and Austria need
to decide if they will move away from their common border (Cooperate)
or invade (Defect). If both Cooperate, it can set them up for a reasonable
start and good long-term relationship. If both Defect, no one loses a home
supply center, but it will sow distrust and put them behind the other players
as their forces will not have moved. And if one Cooperates and the other
Defects, a home supply center will be lost, putting one player at a significant
disadvantage.
While Diplomacy frequently creates high emotional moments like this,
the Prisoner’s Dilemma does not always need to involve such high stakes. For
example, in Hoity Toity, players in the Auction House may choose to purchase
an item, play a Thief card to steal money, or a Detective card to catch a thief.
While this is fundamentally an RPS mechanic (RES-07), if multiple players
choose Thief, they cancel out and no thieves gain any benefit. This adds
elements of a PD, but in a lighter way as there is no negotiation in Hoity Toity,
and for players the stakes are much lower.
Another example of this is Incan Gold, where each turn players need to
decide simultaneously if they are continuing to explore an abandoned temple
in search of treasure or will return home. Sometimes earlier treasure and
artifacts may be left behind players, to be scooped up by players who leave
the cave. In particular, artifacts create a PD, as they are only gained if a single
player chooses to leave the temple. If multiple players leave the cave on the
same turn, none gain the artifacts. This implementation also tends to be light
as there are potential benefits for both staying and leaving, and no negotiation
prior to selection.
Cosmic Encounter introduces the PD through Negotiation cards. Conflict
is resolved by both attacker and defender selecting a Number card from their
hand. The player with the highest Number card plus Force strength wins
the battle. Players also have the option to play a Negotiate card, if they have
one, instead of a Number card. If both players Negotiate, they are allowed
to negotiate a deal, which can be mutually beneficial. However, if only one

132

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Negotiates, that player automatically loses, and the player and their allies
lose all their involved forces. In an interesting twist, the player who chose a
Negotiate card in this situation gains a small compensating benefit, but not
Allies. Thus, inviting Allies to join you in a battle where you know you will
play a Negotiate is its own form of Defection, building a secondary PD into
the core mechanism.
Dead Last has two players dividing up four loot cards, and adds a third
option to the classic PD. In addition to Share and Steal (Cooperate/Defect),
players may also choose Grab One, which guarantees exactly one loot card,
possibly leaving three for the opponent.

Alternate Removal

Description
The player with fewer units removes one. Then players alternate removing
units until reaching a set number, one player is out of units, or some other
stopping mechanism.

Discussion
The system of Alternate Removal was first introduced in the 1980 game
Civilization. Conflict in Civilization only needs to be resolved if the total
number of tokens in an area exceeds its carrying capacity (representing
the fertility of the particular area), which ranges from 1 to 5. If the total
quantity exceeds this, the Alternating Removal process is initiated. Tokens
are removed, starting with the player with the fewest, until the total number
of tokens no longer exceeds the carrying capacity.
If players have equal numbers of tokens, the tied players each remove a
token at the same time.
This system has a variety of intriguing features. First, it is strictly
deterministic. It is a determinative process with no hidden information. This

134

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

is rare among conflict resolution mechanisms. Second, coexistence in an area
is allowed and common. Many games with conflict or battles for areas only
permit a single player to ultimately occupy an area or control it in the case
of Area Majority games (ARC-02). This gives more flexibility for players to
negotiate and settle borders.
Finally, it gives the design hooks for special abilities later in the game. For
example, if only one player in a Conflict has Metal Working, they are always
the last to remove a token.
Inis uses a similar removal system, except that players have the option of
removing a unit or discarding a card. In addition, players have the option,
after taking a casualty, to withdraw from the battle rather than pursue the
conflict. Notably, this doesn’t trigger a retreat from the disputed territory.

Physical Action

Description
A Physical Action needs to be performed by one or more players to determine
the outcome of the action.

Discussion
The most common type of Physical Action used for this type of resolution
is “flicking” a puck or disc towards a target zone. Catacombs uses flicking
for almost all resolutions. Heroes are represented by discs and are flicked to
move through the dungeon. When firing arrows or fireballs, smaller discs
are placed on the board and flicked towards the enemy to resolve the attack.
Ascending Empires and Seal Team Flix also have players flick on a map of the
playing surface to resolve actions. Space Cadets has an abstract target board
that determines whether the target is hit and the amount of damage.
Adding a physical element, like flicking, makes for an intuitive, tense, and
exciting play experience by adding Performance Uncertainty (Chapter 6). It
is somewhat skill-based, but also acts as a randomizer. However, its use does
give a game a lighter feel, as it can give a “toy” feel, as players interact with
the game pieces. In a highly strategic game, this can lead to a disconnect,
as the strategy is undercut by what can feel like a highly variable resolution
mechanism. It also can make players that are poor at performing the activity
feel like they are at a disadvantage throughout the game, and it is not
something that they can compensate for, leading to a negative experience.

136

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

While flicking is a popular implementation of a physical resolution
mechanism, there are a wide variety of alternatives. Flip Ships has a form of
flicking, with a ship being placed on a platform and flipped off of it. Dungeon
Fighter has players bounce a die off the table surface to land on a target.
Wallenstein introduced the Cube Tower. This is a tower with internal
ledges. Players resolve a conflict by taking a specific number of cubes of
different colors (the attacking and defending cubes, for example), and throw
them into the tower. The cubes that emerge at the bottom determine the
outcome. Cubes that get stuck inside are left behind and may emerge in future
conflicts. If a player knows he or she has many cubes stuck in the tower, he or
she may be more inclined to initiate conflicts, for example.
Stacking is used in a variety of games, including Junk Art, Animal Upon
Animal, and Bausack. Typically, in these games, the stacking is the core of
the game. It does not tell the player the outcome of some other action, like a
combat, but instead determines whether the player stays in the game or not
or is eliminated. However, Meeple Circus is a stacking game in which players
create their own stacks, attempting to include specific pieces in different
configurations to qualify for both private and public goals (VIC-11).
Other games have objects being removed, like Ker-Plunk and Don’t Break
the Ice. There are also games that combine removal with stacking, including
Jenga and Villa Paletti.
Finally, there are a variety of outlier physical mechanics, including
throwing darts in Dart Wars, distinguishing items by feel in Space Cadets,
egg-removal in Gulo Gulo, the pie launcher of Pie Face, finger gymnastics of
Climb!, and popping balloons in Kamasutra. A comprehensive listing of these
is far beyond the scope of this book.
Another variation on physical resolution is Speed Matching. Cards
(typically) are flipped up, and players need to see if two match, and either slap
the cards or grab a totem. Games that incorporate this type of system include
Jungle Speed and Scan. The inclusion of a physical action can give players an
opportunity to feint and induce a mistaken grab by other players, leading to
a penalty in some games. Jungle Speed incorporates this tactic.
Introducing a physical action gives the designer a chance to add physical
handicaps to mix up the challenges and make them harder. It also ups the
“zaniness” factor, giving games a lighter feel. Dungeon Fighter has players
act with their non-dominant hand, eyes closed, and various other physical
challenges.

Static Capture

Description
Pieces are captured when another piece occupies or passes over their space.

Discussion
This is one of the oldest conflict resolution mechanisms, going back thousands
of years.
Typically combined with a movement system, a token is affected in some way
when another enters its space. For example, it may be captured (Chess, Checkers),
sent back to start (Parcheesi, Trouble, Sorry!, Backgammon) or switch sides (Shogi).
In order to make capturing challenging and meaningful, the movement
of pieces needs to be restricted in some fashion. Chess and Shogi allow pieces
to move to defined squares, while the Parcheesi family of games uses a
randomizer and the moved piece must, typically, move the full amount. More
information about Movement schemes is in Chapter 10, but a few features
are worth noting here.
In most cases, the moving piece will make the capture on its final space of
movement. This is particularly true of games where movement is controlled
by a randomizer, with pieces typically needing to land on an opposing piece
by exact count to make a capture. There are exceptions, of course. Sorry!

Resolution

139

has specific areas where a piece may slide through multiple spaces, sending
all pieces encountered back to start, and in Checkers pieces make jumps to
capture, and can string together multiple jumps as a single move.
Motion is not a requirement for this mechanism. Through the Desert allows
players to claim Palm Trees for points by extending a chain of camels across
the board. Camels do not move once placed, but players may only add to
chains in certain ways. Expedition has a similar chain mechanism, as players
attempt to “capture” certain cities on the board to earn points.
Tash Kalar: Arena of Legends has players placing pieces on the board, trying
to achieve certain patterns. When those patterns are realized, enemy pieces
may be captured.
While not truly Static Capture, there are games that feature pushing as
a means to capture, including Abalone. In these games, there are typically
restrictions on which pieces can move and be captured. In these games, pieces
or groups of pieces may push other pieces, typically with the intention of
pushing them off the board or into a dead space. Because of the physical
nature of pushing, particularly chain pushing, the physical design of the
board and pieces usually facilitates the mechanism. Abalone has a grooved
board that makes it easy to push marbles in the six hexagonal directions.

Enclosure

Description
Players are trying to surround pieces or key areas.

Discussion
Dating back thousands of years, Go is one of the most famous examples of
this type of conflict resolution. If a group of connected stones has no empty
spaces adjacent to it, it is captured. While the stones themselves are static, the
evolution of groups gives Go a dynamic feel.
Reversi implements Enclosure by allowing players to flip tiles of the
opposing color that are between two tiles of their own color.
The nature of Enclosure games makes certain regions of the board more
or less desirable. In Reversi the corner and edge spaces are more valuable, as
it is harder or impossible to surround pieces located there. Similarly in Go,
players typically start near corners, where it is easier to enclose territory and
make stones safe, and then extend down the sides and towards the middle.
Elements of Enclosure games can also be seen in games like Samurai,
where the objective is to surround board elements with tiles. These are both
Enclosure games and a type of Area Majority (ARC-02), where tiles can be

Resolution

141

placed so that they are adjacent to multiple objectives, contributing strength
towards both.
In general, good enclosure games are designed so that pieces are both
trying to enclose and at risk of being enclosed themselves, or there are several
possible ways they can be used for Enclosure.

RES-13

Minimap

Description
When a conflict is initiated, pieces are moved to a separate board for resolution.

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanic, as it is a way of organizing conflict, and relies on
one of the other methods discussed here to actually resolve individual attacks.
One of the earliest examples of the Minimap mechanism is the 1962
game Bismarck. In this naval game, players secretly move task forces around
a search board. When they discover each other, task forces are moved to the
Battle Board, where the conflict is actually resolved (through a Stat Check
mechanism in Bismarck’s case). It is like “zooming in” on the battle to get
more tactical. Video games like Master of Orion and Heroes of Might and
Magic implement a similar system.
The Battle Board was later extended in Titan, where players move groups
of monsters (Legions) around a master board. When two opposing Legions
meet in the same space, they are transferred to a battle board to actually fight
the battle. Titan is notable in that it has a different battle board for each type
of terrain, and the side the defender sets up on depends on the direction from
which the attacker entered the space. This makes battles extremely variable
and tactical.

Resolution

143

A much simpler version of this mechanism is used in Axis & Allies, which
uses a Battle Board not to give tactical options to the players, but as a player
aid to help organize and keep track of the strength of units, what they need
to roll to hit, and which units are still able to fire. This is more of a graphic
design technique than a mechanism. A similar system is seen in many Force
Commitment games (ARC-06).
A variation on this can be seen in Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century,
which has both a solar system map and separate maps for each planet,
co-located on the board. Unlike Titan, which has many, many Jungle spaces,
all of which resolve on the Jungle board, here the planet maps are very specific
to the planets in the solar system, and act as a place for units on the planet to
be located, and for ground battles to be resolved.

RES-14

Force Commitment

Description
The players select how many of their forces they will commit to the battle to
different categories. The players then reveal their assignments, and resolve.

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanic that builds on other Resolution means. Typically,
players will reveal their strengths in different categories, with the High
Number gaining the benefit (RES-01). If the allocation portion of this
mechanism is done secretly, it is a Sealed Bid Auction, so considerations noted
in that section (AUC-05) apply here.
In one of the earlier implementers of this system, Dune, and its successor
Rex: Final Days of an Empire, have players allocating to just two categories:
in the battle or out of the battle. Units that a player commits to a battle
will be lost. In addition, all units from the loser are eliminated. This system
makes the players evaluate giving themselves a higher chance to win (by
committing larger forces), versus preserving as much of their force as possible,
by committing fewer forces.

Resolution

145

Dune augments the mechanism by allowing the players to also commit
leaders and bonus cards along with forces. This uncertainty is critical for this
system to work, so that the player with the larger force cannot just bid one
more than the size of the smaller.
A modified form of this system has the loser only losing part of its force,
not the full force. This makes the decision of Force Commitment for the
larger side more challenging, as it introduces more Yomi (UNC-01) by giving
a broader possible strength range of the commitment of the smaller force.
Cry Havoc and Rising Sun give more options to players for Force allocation.
In Cry Havoc, players may allocate forces to take control of the area being
fought over, cause casualties, or take prisoners. Control and Prisoners are
executed by the player with the most forces in that region, while Cause
Casualties is executed by all players who have units there. Tactics cards can
also be played to affect the battle in various ways.
Rising Sun has a similar system to Cry Havoc, except with slightly different
assignment options (the ability to sacrifice your own units for victory points,
for example). Also, while Rising Sun uses the same simultaneous secret
assignment of forces, Cry Havoc has the Attacker allocate first, followed by
the Defender. Secret assignment emphasizes the guessing nature and leads to
a lighter, more random feel, while sequential assignment removes luck, but
may give an advantage to the side that places last (the Defender, in the case
of Cry Havoc).
These types of systems give the players a lot of flexibility in the goals they
want to achieve in a battle. Are they trying to hold ground? Cause losses?
Earn points? The player can use the options to pursue a variety of strategies.

Voting

Description
Players vote on whether a proposed action will occur or not.

Discussion
The Voting mechanism is often used in games with a political theme, although
some, like Die Regeln Wir Shon, are more abstract. In some games, each player
gets one vote. In others, players may have multiple votes that they can apply.
Voting is in many ways an Area Majority mechanism (ARC-02), except
that players are either on the “Yay” or “Nay” sides, rather than only able to
win something individually. This can lead to shifting coalitions of players on
either side of an issue, as interests align and diverge, underscoring the political
nature of this resolution means.
The item being voted on can fit at various levels in the game. In Junta,
players are voting on whether the budget proposed by El Presidente passes,
and the money distributed to the players. This is an example of a sub-system
of the game that links to other key mechanisms. The Republic of Rome is
similar in that players are voting on which characters should gain offices, how
wars are conducted, and even execution of characters. These decisions then
feed into other systems to propel the game forward.
Some games have players vote on actual changes to the rules themselves.
Democrazy and Das Regeln Wir Shon are the prime examples of this, as
players play cards that contain possible game rules, and players vote on them.

Resolution

147

Proposing rules that help several players, including yourself, but yourself a
little bit more, is a key skill in the game, and can lead to intriguing and
exciting game play. These rules changes range from what actions are available
to players, how resources can be exchanged, how the game ends, and what
contributes towards victory.
Galactic Destiny, which includes a Galactic Senate mechanism, also has
players vote on new rules to be added, but these are not the core of the game.
They impact what actions players may perform, and what is legal or illegal.
As mentioned earlier, some voting games, like Das Regeln Wir Shon, give
one vote to each player, and a simple majority wins. However, there are other
variations. In Junta and Republic of Rome, the players represent factions, and
so they may have control of various characters or blocks of voters that give
them more than one vote. If players are powerful enough, they may even be
able to pass anything they want.
Some games vary from simple majority in votes. In Article 27: The UN
Security Council Game, a unanimous vote is required for a measure to pass.
Bribery and other inducements are encouraged to get players to vote your way.
While voting systems can be dynamic and interesting, they also encourage
negotiation, which can make this mechanism very time consuming. This
should be carefully considered by the designer when determining if it is
appropriate for the player experience desired.

Player Judge

Description
One player, the judge, decides the outcome of the Action.

Discussion
The standard use of this resolution mechanism is in games where players are
performing a task, and there is no objective criteria as to which is best, so one
player acts as Judge to select the winner. For example, in Apples to Apples, one
player is the Judge, and the other players select one of their noun cards to
match an adjective card. The Judge then selects which they think is closest.
Similarly, in The Big Idea, players use noun cards to pitch products that
fulfill a need, and the Judge selects which they like the most.
In these games, the role of Judge either rotates around the table in a regular
fashion, or passes to the player who won the last round. The latter is a type
of balancing mechanism as the Judge usually cannot score, so it gives other
players an opportunity to close the gap (VIC-18).
This Player Judge mechanism allows players to tailor their answers to the
Judge, and what their preferences might be. The best implementations of this
system have anonymous responses, as in Apples to Apples. In games where it
is known which player goes with which answer, the Judge may go against
the spirit of the game, and deliberately not select players due to their score,
rather than the intrinsic worth of their submission. Personal relationships that
are outside of the game may also impinge (like someone giving preferential
treatment to a spouse). While this mechanism is typically used in lighter games,

Resolution

149

so this may not be that much of an issue, it is still a consideration, particularly
when playing with children who may be more emotionally involved.
Some games, like Say Anything, sidestep this issue by having the players bet
on which answer the Judge will select. This makes it impossible for the Judge
to game the system and keeps players more involved in the game.

Targeted Clues

Description
A player gives clues that he or she wants some, but not all, players to guess.

Discussion
This resolution mechanism is often used in party games, or lighter social
games. The core idea is that one player is giving clues to the group about,
typically, a word or phrase, and the other players try to guess the answer.
However, it is bad for the clue-giver if either no players guess correctly, or if
all players guess correctly. The player scores the most points when some of the
players guess correctly, but not all.
For example, in Barbarossa, players make small clay sculptures to represent
something—a lion, for example. If no one guesses that it is supposed to be
a lion, or if everyone does, the sculpting player does not score. They need
to make a sculpture that is somewhere between obvious and obscure. Dixit
operates similarly but with pictures.
Decrypto is a variation on this idea. The players are broken up into two
teams. One team has a list of four words that all players on the team can
see. The clue giver needs to give a clue that will allow their team to select the

Resolution

151

right word from the list. The other team can hear those clues but does not see
the word list. Over several rounds, players need to give multiple clues for the
same word, and if the other team can figure out the word or concept, they can
win. Thus, clues need to be given that are straightforward enough for your
team to get it, without the opposing team figuring it out.

Tie-Breakers

Description
If a resolution results in a tie, players look to an alternate means to break it.

Discussion
While we include this in Resolution, this is a meta-mechanic that can apply
to Victory, Auctions, and many other mechanisms. While there are a wide
variety of tie-break mechanisms, they typically fall into one of these categories:
• Resource: The player with the most or least of a particular resource will
break the tie. For example, in Trade on the Tigris, if the score is tied
at the end of the game, the game is won by the player with the fewest
Barbarian tokens. If these are also tied, the win goes to the player with

Resolution

153

the most Culture tokens. In a two-player game this resource may take
the form of a Priority token, with the player holding the Priority token
breaking the tie, and then passing the token to their opponent. This is
similar to the Possession arrow in basketball.
• Positional: The player in a specific position in the turn order, or on a
track, will break the tie. A common tie-breaker is for the player who
is closest to the First Player will break the tie. As another example, in
Rising Sun, the player who is higher on the Honor track wins the tie.
In conflict games that use dice to resolve, ties will go to the defender.
Risk works this way, for example. If the defender rolls a 6, they will win
regardless of what the attacker rolls. Most often ties go to the defender,
but in some games that want to encourage aggression, ties may go to
the attacker.
• Random: Players roll off or use some other randomization means to
break the tie. This can be exciting but time-consuming. For certain
tie-breakers, most notably if players are tied at the end of the game,
breaking the tie randomly will be unsatisfying for players.
• Secondary Values: Components have a unique secondary value that
is used to break ties. For example, in Libertalia, the role cards have a
number on them that says when in sequence they should be played. For
example, the Monkey card is #2, and is executed before the Cabin Boy
which is #5. If two players both play a Monkey, they both have #2 on
them. However, to resolve the tie, there is a smaller Flag number on each
card, which is unique between all players. For example, one player has a 3
Flag on their Monkey card, while another has a 5, so the 3 would go first.
The flag numbers are distributed so that on average each player will win
the same number of ties. This gives a quick and simple way to break ties.
The procedures described above, like in Libertalia and Rising Sun,
determine which player wins the tie. However, some games award a tiebreaking ability to a specific player, who then decides which player is chosen.
For example, in A Game of Thrones, the player that wins the auction for the
Throne gains the ability to decide who wins all ties. This immediately brings
Negotiation elements into the game, (ECO-18) as players can lobby the
player who resolves ties.
It is also possible to not have a tie-breaker. For in-game resolutions, ties
may be resolved as friendly or unfriendly. A friendly resolution means that all
tied players gain the benefit of the action. If the leader in a particular category
scores ten points, for example, if players are tied, they all score the ten points.

154

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

In unfriendly ties, tied players receive a reduced award or no award at all.
Either way all players are treated equally.
For final victory, some games do not offer tie-breakers, and have the
players share in the victory. This may or may not be acceptable to players
depending on the likelihood of ties and the length and seriousness of the
game. If possible, tie-breakers for final victory should reward the players who
have had a harder route to win, for example by going last in the turn order,
by acquiring a harder-to-obtain resource, or by using fewer resources overall.

Dice Selection

Description
Player rolls multiple dice and selects one based on a rule.

Discussion
In this Dice Selection mechanism, players roll a set number of dice and choose
one of them to represent the result. The most common implementation of
this has players roll two dice and select the highest or lowest. Dungeons &
Dragons uses this system and refers to the two states as “advantaged” and
“disadvantaged.” An alternative is for players to roll three dice, and to choose
the median die.
A High/Low selection is a way for designers to skew single die results fairly
significantly towards the high or low end. Conversely, a median selection
system makes extreme results unlikely.

The table above shows the chances of rolling different numbers with a
standard die roll, rolling 2 dice and selecting the highest (or lowest), and
rolling 3 dice and selecting the middle value. Rolling 2 dice and selecting the
highest almost doubles the chances of a result of 6, and a result of 1 is 80%
less likely than with a standard die roll. Selecting the middle out of 3 dice
emphasizes results of 3 and 4, while cutting the chances of a 1 or 6 in half
compared to standard roll.
Root presents a related system, where 2 dice are rolled for battles, with the
Attacker taking the higher roll, and the defender the lower. This encourages
aggression.

Action Speed

Description
Actions are rated for a speed or initiative. Faster actions are executed first.

Discussion
This system is most commonly used in Simultaneous Action systems
(TRN-09). In Critical Mass, each player selects an action card from their
hand and plays it simultaneously. Each is rated for speed, and faster actions
go sooner than slower ones.
Critical Mass uses numeric speed ratings. Some games use descriptors,
which can be as simple as Fast or Slow, as in The Ares Project, or more thematic,
like First Strike in Magic: The Gathering.
While this often represents the speed of an action, it can also be more
abstract. In Libertalia, characters have a priority rating, and operate in order
of priority, from lowest number to highest.
Typically if actions have the same speed, they are resolved simultaneously,
although a tie-breaker may be used (RES-18). Each card in Libertalia, for
example, has a unique number on it as a secondary tie-breaker.

158

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Speed ratings give players a clear indication of the order of execution of
actions, and the designer another resource to use for balance purposes. Faster
actions can be weaker, while slower actions can be more powerful, but more
likely to not take effect.

Rerolling and Locking

Description
Dice may be rerolled, or may be locked, preventing rerolling.

Discussion
Many people are first exposed to the idea of Rerolling through the classic
game Yahtzee. After rolling, the player may choose to reroll any number of
dice, and may do this twice, for a total of three throws. Yahtzee illustrates
some typical characteristics of reroll systems:
• When dice are rerolled you must take the result (you can’t go back to
the first result)
• You can reroll dice regardless of whether they were rerolled or not
There are variations on this, of course, but this is typical.
From a simplistic perspective, where you are interested only in how high the
number rolled is, assuming the player rerolls anything that is less than a “4,”
the reroll will add, on average, 0.75 to the final number. While it is similar in
result to a +1 modifier, rerolls are experienced differently by the player. First,
the player is choosing whether to reroll or not. This gives them finer-grained
control and gives more tactical nuance to the act of rolling than just gaining a

160

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

set modifier. Also, rolling dice can be inherently exciting, and rerolls make that
happen more frequently. Finally, modifiers (as discussed in RES-02), even +1
modifiers, add to player cognitive load. Just looking at the die result is simpler.
However, unlike modifiers, rerolls can result in the final result being worse
than the initial roll. Whether this is desirable for the experience is a decision
that needs to be determined by the designer.
The opposite mechanism to rerolling is Locking. In a Locking mechanism,
certain die faces cannot be rerolled. They are stuck on that face for the
remainder of the turn. Having a combination of rerolls and locks brings a
Push Your Luck mechanism (UNC-02) to the table, as players need to risk
improving their result with locking more dice. Zombie Dice is one of many
games to implement this combination, as shotgun blast results are locked, and
getting three shotgun blasts in total ends your turn with a bust.
Escape: The Curse of the Temple uses locked dice in a real-time dice rolling
game to force players to interact with each other (to help unlock the dice of
other players), and in general to disrupt the players’ flow and force them to
make some tough decisions.

Kill Steal

Description
Players contribute towards completing a task, but only the player who finally
completes it gets a benefit.

Discussion
This Kill Steal mechanism originated in video games, which is where the term
came from. In tabletop games, it is most frequently seen in combat games,
where the player scoring the last hit to kill a creature gains the experience,
treasure, or other reward.
In Cutthroat Caverns, players are trying to defeat creatures to reach and
defeat the final boss and win the game. If all players are killed, they all lose,
but if at least one survives, the player with the most points wins. See SemiCo-Op (STR-05) for more details about this type of game structure. But

162

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

while all players collectively battle creatures, only the player that lands the
final hit that kills it gains the points. This adds a lot of interesting dynamics
as players maneuver to land that final blow.
Similarly, in the purely competitive games Dungeon Run, Wildlands, and
Space Freaks, as players attack, if monsters or other players are not defeated,
the damage they suffer carries over. Whichever player actually reduces the
health to zero gains the reward.
This mechanism is easy for players to understand and work with, but
it does make things more contentious and raises the stakes, as if you are
performing an attack that should defeat an enemy, but you get unlucky and it
doesn’t, other players can swoop in for the kill, and your efforts are for naught.
Some conflict games, like Adrenaline, avoid Kill Stealing by giving points to
all players who contributed in defeating that opponent, but at the expense of
additional bookkeeping to track who caused what damage.
This mechanism is not limited to combat. It has been used in an economic
game like Valparaiso, where players construct buildings in districts, but the
player who constructs the final house gets a bonus, or an abstract like 6
Nimmt, where players place cards into rows based on their number, and the
person who plays the sixth card takes the whole row (although taking rows is
a bad thing, so perhaps this is better classified as a Reverse Kill Steal).
There are echoes of this mechanism in Gating and Unlocking (ACT-15), as
many games have tracks that players advance on, but the first player to reach
a certain space gets a one-time bonus.

Game End and Victory

ӶӶ
Two characteristics that separate games from other activities are having a
goal and a defined end-game point. Even in a role-playing game (RPG),
which may not have a formal end-game point, a campaign or narrative arc
reaches a climax, and though the characters may continue on to the next
adventure, goals still exist. Achieving goals, or achieving them better than
other players, defines who wins the game. Goals and end-game points are
frequently intertwined in games, so we are exploring them together in this
chapter. The first section primarily features ways of determining the winner,
and the second section contains triggers for ending the game. We conclude
this chapter by looking at several ancillary considerations for these topics.
The first few mechanisms detail different aspects of Victory Points (VPs).
Giving points to players is a straightforward way to determine who wins a
game. Indeed, any victory system can be expressed as VPs. For example,
Snakes & Ladders, which is a Race game (VIC-07), could be treated as having
points. Rather than reaching square 100, players have points based on the
square they are on. The first player to get 100 points (exactly) is the winner
and ends the game. This is a trivial example, but designers should be on the
lookout for other ways to define victory that better meet the theme of the
game. For example, in many business or economic games, the victory goes
to the player with the most money, or the one who surpasses a monetary
threshold.
Many games allow players to collect points from several different activities.
Thousands of years ago, Go allowed the players to score points by both
surrounding territory and capturing enemy stones. Having multiple ways to
gain points gives players multiple strategic approaches and allows players to
judge the relative values of actions.

Victory Points from Game State

Description
An event causes the Game State to be evaluated relative to some scoring
condition. Players earn points based upon how that state matches the
condition.

Discussion
In most points-based games, players manipulate the Game State and then
gain points based on that State. In some games, like 7 Wonders or Agricola,
points are only tallied at the end of the game. However, there are a variety
of ways scoring can be triggered, which can be grouped broadly into three
categories: Scheduled, Player Action, and Random systems.
In Scheduled systems, there are predefined intervals for when scoring will
happen, and players know when they are approaching. For example, in El
Grande, scoring happens three times during the game, after a set number of
rounds. Regardless of which actions the players take, scoring will happen at
exactly those intervals. In Galaxy Trucker, players score at the end of each run,
when a fixed number of hazards are encountered.
In a Player Action system, players are the ones who trigger scoring.
Sometimes this is completely at the discretion of the players, and sometimes
the precise timing falls within a band of possible values. For example, in
Twilight Struggle, players that are dealt a Region Scoring card must play it
sometime during that hand. However, the exact timing is dependent on a
Player Action. The Expanse Board Game is more open-ended, as players can
draft a scoring card any time one is available. They do not have to do it within
a certain time frame.

Game End and Victory

165

In a Random system, there are scoring cards or tokens that are mixed in
with other items. When these are drawn, scoring occurs. In Airlines, Scoring
cards are shuffled into the deck. As each is drawn, scoring happens. The
drawing of the last card also ends the game (VIC-12). In practice, truly
random scoring systems are rare. Frequently, scoring cards are shuffled into
the bottom third of the deck, or some similar range. Other random triggers
involve seeing two, or even three more of the same type of card, as in Incan
Gold, where the second hazard of the same type drawn ends the round, or
Ethnos, where the third dragon drawn ends the age. These systems are random,
but their likely outcomes fall within a predictable range.
Games that score just one time, at game end, can fall into any of these
categories depending on how the end of game is triggered.
Many systems are a blend between these categories. Twilight Struggle has
elements of all three, as Scoring is under player control (somewhat), must
occur by a definite point in the game (Scheduled), but it is also Random in
that it is not known in which round the Region Scoring cards will be in play.
Rather than seeing these differences as categorical, we can say that scoring
systems have some or all of these characteristics.
Area Majority (ARC-02) and Economic games (Chapter 7) in particular
tend to use the VP from Game State mechanism. Area Majority games are
very concerned about board state, and their core concept is maneuvering
your resources to be able to obtain the most majorities when scoring is
triggered. Similarly, in Economic Games, where money is often a proxy for
VPs, businesses can pay out based on the state of the boards and markets.
Power Grid, for example, pays out money based on connected cities at the
end of each turn.
A Scheduled trigger is best suited for more strategic games, as it allows for
long-term planning. Random triggers are excellent at creating tension but
can reward players who simply happened to be in a superior position when
scoring occurs. Player Action triggers can be highly strategic or quite tactical,
depending on implementation. Players can plan and trigger scoring when it is
most beneficial to them, leading to interesting choices. It can also add tension
as other players try to take advantage of another player triggering scoring,
particularly in games where the possibility of a scoring option is hidden (as
in Twilight Struggle).
While Scheduled trigger systems are more strategic, they can also lead to bad
edge effects. An “edge effect” is a distortion of gameplay when it approaches a
boundary. If players know exactly when scoring will occur, the final actions
leading up to scoring can be subject to over-analysis and game-lengthening

166

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

delays as players attempt to optimize their scores, particularly if there are
no hidden elements. Depending on the nature of the game, this can impact
players’ enjoyment.
Some Schedule-based systems put scoring at the end of each player’s
turn, like Small World and Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization. Because
of the proximity of the player’s actions to when scoring occurs, this blurs
with Victory Points from Player Actions (VIC-02). It is worth noting that
sometimes these systems award points at the start of a player’s turn, not the
end; King of Tokyo is an example. This means that players need to maintain
their state as the other players take their turns and can lead to interesting
interactions.

Victory Points from Player Actions

Description
Players earn points by performing actions.

Discussion
In contrast with Victory Points from Game State, this mechanism gives players
points based on discrete actions which may be very local. An example would
be capturing stones in Go, where each stone is worth one point. Surrounding
territory in Go, the other way of scoring points, is only evaluated at the end of
the game, and until that point can be invaded, shrunk, or expanded.
Eclipse and Kemet offer Victory Points (VPs) for winning battles. Many
games, like Lords of Waterdeep, Nexus Ops, or Splendor, have players take
actions to complete or claim private or public goal cards (VIC-11), which are
worth points.
The relationship between the Action that you perform to gain VPs and
how that affects your position and the game state has an important impact
on the flow of the game. In some, like Lords of Waterdeep, completing quest
cards is the main point of the game, and doesn’t aid or hinder your ability to
perform other actions in the future.
However, in games like Dominion and Splendor, taking Victory cards can
hinder your ability to gain more Victory cards. In Dominion, the point cards
become part of your deck, but they have no purpose if drawn. They simply
clog things up. In Splendor, purchasing high value cards does not give you as
much of a “bang for your buck” for getting gem bonuses as purchasing lower
cost cards. In these games, the players need to choose between building up
their engine or economy and cashing in on it. It creates what we call a “pivot,”

168

where players need to transition between building and scoring. This can be
an interesting puzzle for players to work through.

VIC-03 Temporary and Permanent Victory Points

Description
Some Victory Points (VPs) are never lost. Others depend on the game state
and may be lost if that state changes.

Discussion
This mechanism is typically used in games where the ending condition is a
player reaching a certain number of VPs. For example, in Catan the game
ends when a player reaches 10 points. In Kemet it ends when a player reaches
8 points.
Gaining permanent VPs is important to help drive the game to a conclusion.
If all points are temporary, it encourages players to try to take down the
leader, and pull them further away from winning, which can lengthen the
game. Munchkin, where player level is a proxy for VPs, has this issue, as do
Dune and Cosmic Encounter, which require players to hold a certain number
of spaces.
Having a mix of temporary and permanent points is a good way of dealing
with this issue, as it both drives the game towards a conclusion and offers
opportunities for players to make a sudden grab for victory or move their
opponents away from victory if they have a lot of temporary points.
Kemet is a good example of this technique. Permanent VPs are gained
through winning battles, controlling temples, certain Power cards, and other
means. Temporary points are gained by holding special regions on the board.

170

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

So, if a player has a bank of VPs but is a few points shy of victory, he or she
can launch attacks on spaces to try to gain those last few points and win. This
can lead to dramatic moments in the game and can also incentivize players to
over-extend themselves and take a chance, which increases tension.

Victory Points as a Resource

Description
Victory Points (VPs) may be spent as a currency to impact the game state.

Discussion
Economic games, where money represents victory, are the primary examples
of this mechanism. Having players spend and invest money to make more
money is at the core of business and finds representation in many business
games. This forces players to think about valuation and Return On Investment
(ROI) as key drivers in their decisions. What is the expected payback on the
available options?
This mechanism is also used outside of economic games as well. Small
World is a great example, where players must spend VPs to skip over certain
options on a Draft Track, creating an auction-like mechanic for valuing the
races available (AUC-08).
Typically, players will be more cautious about spending VPs when they are
not themed as money. In the context of an Economic game, players may not
even really think about money as a “Victory Point” currency. We are so used
to using it in our everyday lives that we inherently understand the concept
of investing for future payout. However, when they are represented as a VPs,
Honor, or other thematic element, they take on a different connotation, and
players tend to be more emotionally attached to them.
Understanding this underlying psychology gives the designer another tool
for shaping the player experience.

Hidden and Exposed Victory Points

Description
Victory Points (VPs) may be public or private information.

Discussion
The decision of whether to have the number of VPs each player has be public
or private information can have a big impact on the play experience. It is
particularly dependent on the method for ending the game, and the overall
amount of hidden and public information.
If a game has a set number of turns, so that players know exactly when
the end is coming, and most information is public, including VPs, it can
lead to over-analysis during the last turn, as players try to optimize that last
play. Alternatively, there can be situations where the last turn is meaningless
because the leading player cannot be unseated (in which case consider VIC-15
Short Circuits). Typically, this is considered undesirable by players, although
certain types of games and players can support this. If the points are hidden, or
if players are not sure what other players can do, through hidden information,
this tendency is alleviated.
As an example, the 1999 game, Vinci, had players controlling civilizations
that would rise and fall across Europe. Scores were open, and the number
of turns was fixed. Vinci was in general positively regarded; however, many
reviewers found the final turn very unsatisfying. Players scored points at

174

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

the end of their turn, and turns were deterministic. Players could calculate
exactly how to maximize their score, and often spent quite a bit of time doing
so, to squeeze out one more point. Years later, the game was reworked and
re-released as Small World. The main structural change was the introduction
of hidden scores, and a minor random element. These changes were sufficient
to alleviate the last turn issue, and give the game a much lighter feel, turning
it into one of the staples of the hobby gaming market.
Conversely, having too many hidden bonus points at the end of the game
can lead to an unsatisfying play experience. See VIC-06 for a full discussion.

End-Game Bonuses

Description
Players earn bonus Victory Points (VPs) at the end of the game.

Discussion
This is a popular technique for giving players strategic direction. Giving
players a specific goal to earn points early in the game gives new players an
idea of what they should be doing.
End-Game Bonuses can be either Personal or Public. Points from Personal
goals can only be earned by the owner, while Public goals may be pursued by
multiple players. In some games, goals are non-exclusive, and can be scored
by multiple players, while in others, only the player who achieves the goal “the
best” receives the points.
Public goals provide a natural interaction point for players and can be used
where there is not as much player interaction through the other mechanisms.
In their simplest form, public goals are a method for turning any puzzle into a
competitive game. In Dimension, for example, players use the same set of spheres
to build a pyramid that satisfies as many of the six public goals as possible.
Private goals help differentiate players and can give a strong direction to
their play. For example, in Ticket to Ride, the tickets tell players which cities
to connect, but points are awarded (or lost) only at the end of the game. This
gives players a literal roadmap of their goals.

176

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

There are a number of benefits of keeping personal goals hidden, like
making it impossible to precisely determine who is winning and adding an
element of deduction as players attempt to block each other. Ticket to Ride
with exposed goals would be a very different, and more frustrating, experience.
Another design consideration is when and how goals are assigned. Sometimes
they are random, and sometimes players must construct or choose their goals.
A concern for designers is that if goals are assigned randomly, later in the game
players may luck into points by being randomly dealt a goal that they have already
achieved. This is one reason earlier assignment of bonuses is generally preferred,
unless countered by a penalty for not achieving them (as in Ticket to Ride). Games
such as Race for the Galaxy may give players access to a random selection
of possible End-Game Bonuses, but players may choose to build them or not.
Concordia allows players to draft cards which will give bonus points in specific
categories. Having more cards in a given category increases the point value.
Terraforming Mars has an interesting approach to assigning end-game
goals. Players may use an action and spend money to unlock specific public
End-Game Bonuses. The amount of money required increases each time a
new goal is unlocked, so waiting until you are certain about what you want
to unlock means spending more resources. Only three goals at most, can be
unlocked, putting more pressure on players to decide which goals they think
they can win at.
Designers should also consider the ratio between points earned during the
game and points earned at the end. If the ratio is very large, and bonuses are
complex or hidden, it can be very difficult for players to know where they
stand. This increases the skill and experience required to play the game well.
For example, in Concordia, all points are earned from End-Game Bonuses.
To offset that issue, the game includes an optional intermediate scoring
step which is basically a practice scoring so that players can make sure they
understand the available bonuses, as well as get a better feel for their relative
position.

Race

Description
The winner is the first player to reach the end of a track.

Discussion
This mechanism is both a way of determining when the game ends and
determining a victory. Both typically occur at the same time as one or more
players cross a finish line or reach a goal.
Some of the oldest games in human history are Race games, including
Senet, Backgammon, Snakes & Ladders, and Parcheesi. They are intuitive about
the goal and it is clear who is in the lead at any point.
There are a variety of games that are mechanically Race games, but don’t
have the trappings of a physical race. Any game that has players trying to
reach a certain target quantity of Victory Points (VPs) is, in essence, a race
game. Catan is a race to get to 10 points. Empire Builder is a race to get to
$250,000,000.
Conversely, there are games that appear to be a Race, but that are actually
not. Typically, these involve betting on the outcome of a race, as in Royal Turf,
Downforce, and Long Shot. These are actually equivalent to VIC-01 Victory
Points from Game State, where the situation on the board feeds into a point
total.
More discussion on actual Race mechanisms are included in Chapter 10,
“Movement.”

Player Elimination

Description
The winner is the only player remaining in the game.

Discussion
Player Elimination is typically considered an anti-pattern, a mechanism to
be avoided. From a purely practical standpoint, elimination may result in
a player not being able to participate with the group for an hour or more,
leading to awkward social situations.
However, it can be effectively used in shorter and lighter games that may be
played multiple times in rapid succession. If being eliminated means that you
are out of the game for 5 or 10 minutes, as in Love Letter or Liar’s Dice, that
is very different than being eliminated early from a game of Risk or Monopoly.
Player Elimination can also be effective if it fits into the narrative and
theme of the game. For example, winning in Nuclear War requires all players
but one to be eliminated. However, when a player is eliminated, they are given
a special Final Retaliation turn where they can launch all the missiles that
remain in their hands at the players of their choice. This is both satisfying and
thematically consonant, and results in many plays having no winner at all.
A different social dynamic arises in team-based games with elimination,
like Werewolf. After being eliminated, players can still participate vicariously,
as they may still be part of the winning team. Werewolf also benefits from
being interesting for non-participants to watch.

180

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

BANG! extends this two-team concept by adding a third side that switches
allegiance. The two main teams are the Lawmen (led by the Sheriff) and the
Outlaws. The Outlaws win if the Sheriff is killed. The Lawmen win if the
Outlaws and the Renegade are killed. The Renegade wins if all the Lawmen
and Outlaws are killed. The Renegade’s strategy is to initially help protect the
Sheriff, and then turn on the Lawmen once the Outlaws are eliminated. Since
roles are hidden, this makes for a very exciting dynamic, even for players who
have been eliminated, as their team may still win.
Another variation on Player Elimination is End-Game Elimination. Based
on certain criteria, one or more players may be eliminated from the possibility
of winning the game. For example, in High Society, players spend money to
gain objects that are worth Victory Points (VPs). The player with the most
VPs wins, except that the player with the least money remaining cannot
win, so players need to track what other players are doing and avoid overspending. Similarly, in Cleopatra and the Society of Architects, players may
take more powerful actions by taking Corruption tokens. At the end of the
game, the hidden Corruption totals are revealed, and the player with the most
Corruption cannot win.
While these examples are deterministic, End-Game Elimination can
also be applied randomly. For example, in The Hunger Games: District 12
Strategy Game, during the game players may choose to, or be forced to, place
tokens into the Tribute pool. At the end of the game, one Tribute token is
drawn at random, and the player it belongs to is eliminated from a chance
at victory. This system gives players a chance to do risk-reward analysis and
is highly thematic with the source material. However, in general, it is not
received as favorably as a deterministic End-Game Elimination mechanism
as players may have many fewer tokens in the pool and still get chosen,
making them feel they lost due to an unlucky break rather than mistakes
they made.

Fixed Number of Rounds

Description
The game ends after a set number of rounds.

Discussion
This is a basic approach to determine when the game will end. However, there
are still some considerations for the designer.
First, players must track the current round, often with a marker on a track.
It’s not a big burden on the players, but it does require them to remember to
advance the token at the end of each round.
If possible, a more natural way of tracking the current round is advised.
An elegant approach is to have items used in the game come off of the round
tracker, instead of pushing a maker along it. In Castles of Burgundy, the new
building tiles that populate the board each round are divided into stacks and
placed on the round tracker. Those tiles are placed on the board each turn,
which is a step players are unlikely to forget, and players can glance at the
round tracker and see, based on how many stacks remain, how many rounds
are left in the game.
Similar techniques can be used for an end-game trigger. The Speicherstadt
has a deck with a fixed number of cards. When the cards run out, the game
is over. This eliminates the need for players to act to advance a marker. The
depletion of the cards happens naturally over the course of the game. The

Game End and Victory

183

number of turns and rounds is the same every game—but the players do not
directly track them.
For example, in Modern Art, the end of each round features the valuation of
paintings, with players placing markers for the most valuable paintings for that
round. However, there are only three slots for these markers, corresponding
to the rounds in the game. The valuation step will not be missed by players,
so this does not increase the rules’ burden on the players.
The other consideration is end-game edge effects. If the players know
that this is the final round, it may change their behavior, which may be
undesirable. One aspect of this is discussed in Hidden and Exposed Victory
Points (VIC-05).

Exhausting Resources

Description
The game end is triggered by a resource being exhausted. Players can affect
the length of the game by how these resources are used.

Discussion
The Exhausting Resources mechanism is a nice balance between driving
the game towards a conclusion and giving the players some control over the
pacing.
In the 18xx series of games, the game end is triggered by all money being
taken out of the bank. In Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, when the
final Age III cards are drawn, the game ends, giving players the option to
draw a lot or a few of the cards to manage the pace. Race for the Galaxy has a
pool of Victory Point (VP) tokens, which end the game when exhausted, and
Dominion concludes when three stacks are exhausted.
While these examples all have a shared resource pool, some games end
when an individual pool is exhausted. Ticket to Ride ends when one player
has 0–2 trains left. In Light Speed, the game moves on to final scoring after
one player has placed all of their ships on the table.
This technique is frequently used as a loss condition for cooperative games.
For example, in Pandemic, having to place a disease cube but having none

Game End and Victory

185

available in the pool will end the game in a loss, as will placing all the ghosts
in Ghost Fightin’ Treasure Hunters.

Completing Targets

Description
The game ends after a set number of targets or goals are completed.

Discussion
In one sense the Completing Target mechanism is related to Exhausting
Resources (VIC-10), as meeting X targets could be represented by removing
“mission accomplished” markers from a pool and having the game end when
those markers are exhausted. The difference in player experience is substantial,
though, and gaining accomplishments is thematically more coherent in most
cases than exhausting “mission accomplished” tokens.
Completing Targets is also similar to Race end-game conditions, where
the game ends when players hit (typically) a victory point goal. However, the
goals can be more than just the accumulation of points, such as curing all
diseases in Pandemic, taking enough keeps in Dune, or destroying the One
Ring in War of the Ring.
In all of these examples, the game is won by the player(s) triggering the
event that ends the game. However, this is not necessarily the case. For

Game End and Victory

187

example, in Race for the Galaxy, the game can end several ways, one of which
is by a player getting seven cards into their tableau. But the player who does
this does not necessarily win. Winning is determined by other means than
the game ending.
As there is no reason to end the game if you’re not going to win, this
type of trigger can lead to over-analysis. For this reason, designs that can
be triggered by a player action often include hidden points or bonuses that
can make it difficult to judge who is leading. Another design technique that
can be considered is giving a bonus for triggering the end of the game, to
incentivize players to take that action. This mechanism can be found in
Concordia and Azul and is often a factor used to balance issues like players
getting an equal number of turns, but some players knowing that the game
will end when they take their final turn and others now knowing it. See our
discussion of End-Game Bonuses (VIC-06).

Fixed Number of Events

Description
The game ends after an event occurs a specified number of times.

Discussion
The Fixed Number of Events mechanism is most closely associated with card
decks. A number of special trigger cards are shuffled into the deck. When the
last of these is turned up, the game will end.
Airlines implements this system by mixing five Score cards into the stock
deck. Each time a Score card is turned up, an intermediate scoring will occur.
The last Score card initiates Final Scoring and the end of the game.
A similar system is used in High Society but is not directly tied to scoring.
Instead, four special Red cards are inserted into the Auction deck, along with
11 Yellow cards. When the fourth Red card is turned up, the game ends.
This system can add a lot of variability and tension to a game, as players
know approximately when it will end, but not exactly. A possible downside of
this system is that the special cards may all happen very early in the game, or
very late, which creates long stretches with no scoring. It is possible in High
Society for the four Red cards to be the first four cards turned over!
To combat this, many games that incorporate this mechanism use an initial
deck construction method to ensure that the special cards are reasonably well

Game End and Victory

189

distributed. The Expanse, for example, has the players divide the deck up into
three piles, and shuffle two Scoring cards into each section. This ensures
a somewhat even distribution, without the players knowing exactly when
Scoring cards will be turned up.
Get the Goods controls the distribution by shuffling ten Scoring cards
into the deck, with scoring happening when the 4th, 7th, and 10th cards
are turned up. This allows tension to build as Scoring cards are turned up,
while still giving a high probability of a reasonable spread of Scoring cards
throughout the deck.
This mechanism does not require card decks. In Pandemic, players lose if
there are a certain number of Outbreaks. Players track these on a chart on
the board.

Elapsed Real Time

Description
The game ends after a set amount of actual time has elapsed.

Discussion
Games with the Elapsed Real Time mechanism have an overall timer that
is independent of the actions the players are taking. The key advantage is, of
course, that players know exactly how long the game will take, which helps
them schedule and plan. Also, having a timer naturally adds an element of
tension to the game.
The exact implementation of the timer varies. While some older games,
like Escape from Colditz, had players set any timer they had around the house,
or simply check a clock, most modern implementations use some electronic
means. The Omega Virus has the timer built into the taunting computer in the
center of the board, which gleefully tells the players as time runs out. Break the
Safe has a digital countdown timer, evoking many heist films. Atmosfear had
players play a videotape to time the game. Escape: The Curse of the Temple and
Space Alert have an external soundtrack that is played, that provides ambient
sound effects as well as advising the countdown.
Electronic voices and soundtracks also have the advantage of being able to
incorporate mid-game instructions for players.
Escape Room games, like the Exit: The Game series, also rely on elapsed
time, typically tracked by a smart phone.
This mechanism needs extra attention when used in competitive games.
The possibility that players may stall when winning, to run out the clock,
needs to be addressed. This was a weakness in Escape from Colditz, a onevs.-many game (see “STR-03, Team-Based Games” in Chapter 1), where

Game End and Victory

191

one player controlled the German guards trying to prevent the Prisoner Of
War (POW) players from escaping. In the original version of the game, the
German players had a strong incentive to stall and take as long as possible to
make their moves.
The Omega Virus tackles this issue by having an “everyone loses” condition
if time runs out, turning it into a semi-co-op (STR-05). Another option is to
have simultaneous play, which disincentivizes players from stalling.

Connections

Description
The game ends when a specified number of connections are made on the
board.

Discussion
The Connections mechanism can be both an end-game trigger and a means
of victory. It is related to the Race mechanism (VIC-07).
In basic Connection games, like Twixt, it serves as the measure of victory.
The first player to connect opposite sides of the board ends the game and
determines the victor. TransAmerica is won by the first player to connect all
of their cities into a single network.
There are many games, however, that end based on connections, but in
which connections don’t ensure victory. The most prominent example are the
Crayon Rails series, which started with Empire Builder. In Empire Builder,
players build rail networks. The game ends when a single player connects a
certain number of major cities together in their network, as well as passes a
certain threshold of cash. Both conditions are required for game-end and
victory.
Connection can also be used as a sub-game. In Android, players try to
create connections between different groups, which give in-game benefits.
In the 18xx and Age of Steam series, players place hexagonal tiles that have
tracks printed on them onto the board in different configurations. Cable Car
does the same with square tiles. Placing those tiles enables players to create

Game End and Victory

193

routes between stations allowing for delivery of goods and earning money.
Typically, these routes are shared by all players.
Connection games need to deal with several topology issues. Can players
cross the paths of other players? Games that do not permit it, like Twixt, often
become static and have an optimal strategy. It is more typical to allow players
to cross or even parallel other players’ connections by paying a penalty or
increasing resource cost to do so, and/or by requiring a special tile.

Circuit Breaker/Sudden Death

Description
The game has a fixed and known victory condition, and a special variable
condition that ends the game prematurely.

Discussion
Sudden Death conditions can be used for two purposes. First, they can help
end a game once one player is far in front, out of the reach of the other
players. This is referred to as a Circuit Breaker, and is commonly seen in war
games. For example, in Rise and Decline of the Third Reich and The Russian
Campaign, if one player controls a certain number of key locations, they win
immediately. In Twilight Struggle, if one player reaches 20 Victory Points
(VPs) on the Tug-of-War style Victory Point track (VIC-19), then the game
immediately ends.
The Circuit Breaker is good for ending a lopsided game, leading to a more
positive play experience (or at least a shorter one!) for the losing side. Playing
out an obviously lost game is typically not a fun experience.
This mechanism can also be used to add an alternate way for players to
pursue victory. In Liberté, the game normally ends after all faction blocks have
been placed. However, there are two special conditions that players can try to
meet (Radical Landslide and Counter-revolution) to win immediately. Space
Base includes a card that says “You Win.” If a player manages to complete

Game End and Victory

195

the task shown on the card, the game ends immediately and they win. This
technique can be used to open different strategic options for players, or to give
players that are behind the chance for a Hail Mary attempt to win the game.
When they happen, they can be exciting and memorable victories.
Most of the loss conditions for Cooperative Games are also Sudden Death.
This adds to the puzzle that the players need to solve to reach a successful
conclusion.
Somewhat related, Hearts has an alternate condition that adds a fun twist.
Players normally gain 1 point for each heart they take, and 13 points for the
queen of spades (points being bad). But if a player takes all the hearts and the
queen of spades, they force each opponent to take 26 points. This mechanism
works especially well, as it turns what is normally bad into something great.
Looking out for someone trying to “shoot the moon,” as it is called, adds a
lot of interest to Hearts.

Finale

Description
When the main game ends, a special mini-game is played to determine the
victor.

Discussion
This Finale mechanism adds a coda to a game, as it transitions to an alternate
play mode at the end.
In Monsters Menace America, players spend the bulk of the game moving
their monsters around the United States, stomping on cities, battling the
military, gaining upgrades and becoming more powerful.
When the endgame is triggered, the players begin a monster demolition
derby of sorts. The board is ignored, and the monsters simply battle against
each other to determine the final victor. While the player that did the best
during the first part of the game has the best chance to win, it could still be
anyone.
Cable Car is a connection game. But when players complete their
connections they do not simply win. Instead, they need to begin running
their cable car from one end of their track to the other, moving a few spaces
per turn. The remaining players continue taking their turns, and anyone who
completes their track can start moving their car. The player who gets their car
to the end of their track first is the winner.

Game End and Victory

197

This final contest rewards efficiency in both building the track as well as
maximizing the speed of the car. If you complete a very circuitous route first,
you may still lose to a player who was better able to manage their tiles better
and build an efficient route.
Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot is another example.
Players can earn a numbered Magic Carrot during the course of the game.
When they are all claimed, the game ends, and the winner is determined via
lottery. The players draw one carrot at a time from a second carrot deck. The
carrots drawn are losing carrots. Whoever has the final carrot remaining in
the deck is the winner.
This mechanism makes it clear to players what they need to do during the
game to win and adds an exciting end game element. However, it can also
cheapen the meaning of the first part of the game, as a player may dominate
the main game, earning ten tickets while the other players each get only one,
and still lose. As such, this is best suited for quicker and lighter games.
The Finale mechanism is infrequently used as it often requires players to
learn a whole different set of mechanisms to be used for the ending.

King of the Hill

Description
Players earn points by occupying a special position on the board.

Discussion
King of the Hill (KotH) brings several positive attributes to a game. First, it
is simple for players to understand what they need to do to achieve victory.
Gaining points or other benefits by controlling the key location makes the
objective clear to first-time players. In King of Tokyo, players earn points by
remaining in the center of the board throughout the turn, giving the board
state great clarity.
Second, it forces players into conflict. Staying in your own corner of the
board (“turtling”) will not move you closer to victory.
Finally, it gives players a safe space to rebuild and lick their wounds if they
are weaker. If a player is in a bad position, they can simply stay out of the line
of fire until ready. This can push battle games to a more casual place, as the
strong either cannot, or are not incentivized to, pick on the weak. It also leads
naturally to a Catch the Leader mechanism (VIC-18), as everyone will gang
up on the player earning points in the center.
Because of all these items, pure KotH can make a game feel lighter. Players
will try to knock each other out of the center, but conflict does not extend
beyond that.

Game End and Victory

199

Some games have a reward other than Victory Points associated with
holding the center. For example, in Nexus Ops, the player controlling the
center Monolith may draw special Energy cards that aid in various ways.
This encourages players to head for the center and the bonuses there, but also
allows for alternate paths to victory.

Catch the Leader

Description
The game systems advantage players that are behind or disadvantage players
that are ahead.

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanism that can be implemented in a variety of ways.
For example, Power Grid changes turn order based on who is leading. The
player in last always takes the most advantageous position. Age of Steam forces
players to reduce their Victory Points (VPs) based on how many they have.
Players who have more points must lose more. Other games may give special
tokens or abilities to players that are lagging.
While these are all overt, some Catch the Leader mechanisms are more
subtle. A King of the Hill mechanism (VIC-17) typically exposes the leader
to attack, and not other players—or players that are further behind are less
attractive targets. This will naturally incentivize players to try to pull back
the leader.
The designer should consider the severity of the Catch the Leader
mechanism. If it is too strong, it can be advantageous for players to sandbag,
and try to stay back to make a strong late move rather than be penalized

Game End and Victory

201

earlier. Depending on the theme and nature of the game, this may or may
not be desirable.
Designers should also look out for the opposite of a Catch the Leader
mechanism (“snowballs”), where the game mechanisms make it easier for
players in the lead to get further ahead. Economic games are susceptible
to this, as the measure of victory (money) is also the resource that helps
growth and power. Monopoly is an example. Splitting the victory currency
from cash can alleviate this issue. For example, players may need to use cash
to buy antiques, which actually give VPs. This forces players to decide when
to turn their working resource into a victory resource. See Victory Points as
a Resource for more details (VIC-04).

Tug of War

Description
A marker is moved up and back on a track towards or away from a neutral
position.

Discussion
Tug of War can be both a scoring mechanism and an end-game trigger.
In its simplest form, two players will move a marker back and forth along
a track, with each of them owning one end of the track. If the marker reaches
the end of a track it typically triggers an event, such as ending the game, as in
Twilight Struggle. In this case it also triggers victory for the player who moves
the marker to their end.
It may also trigger a scoring event, as in Guardians, where each location has
a short tug-of-war track. If the marker reaches the end of a track, the player
owning that end scores points for the location, and it is removed from the
game and replaced.
Tug of War is not limited to two players. When there are three or more
sides represented, each has a branch leading from a central neutral point.
Churchill is a three-player game, with players debating over issues around
World War II. Each issue starts in the center of the track. When a player
influences an issue, it moves towards their track, or, if it is on another player’s
track, first towards the neutral point, and then up their track. Churchill also
has a special trigger if an issue reaches the end of one of the tracks. In that
case, the issue is locked for that player, and it can no longer be influenced up
and down the tracks. The game also features multiple issues on the tug-of-war
track at the same time, allowing the designer to introduce more complexity
and player options by allowing multiple issues to be influenced with one
action, or special bonuses for certain types of issues.

Game End and Victory

203

Another example of multiple players influencing multiple items is Starship
Samurai, where players are trying to sway factions to their side. Each player
has a track on the alliance board, and if a faction is on another player’s track,
in order to sway them to your side you first move the faction token down
towards a neutral zone off of that player’s track, and then up your track.
The location of the marker can also award points or abilities at certain
times. In Twilight Struggle, for example, if no Sudden Death conditions are
triggered (VIC-15) and the game ends by concluding the final turn, the
winner is decided by the location of the marker on the track. The location
of the markers at Conference end in Churchill at the end of the debate phase
determines who gets to decide on the outcome of the issue. Starship Samurai
awards victory points or resources based on the location of each faction at
the end of the round.
This mechanism is very clean and easy for players to understand,
particularly in the two-player version. It is easy for players to see where they
stand, and what actions influence the track. When used for an end-game
condition, it is typically used as a Sudden Death condition, as requiring that
the marker reach the end means that there needs to be some means to drive
the game towards a conclusion. It also means that as one player moves closer
to victory, the other moves further away. This can reduce tension as compared
to a Completing Targets system (VIC-11), where all players may be close to
victory at the same time.

Highest Lowest

Description
Each player’s score is equal to the lowest value of several categories. Whoever
has the highest lowest value is the winner.

Discussion
As the title of this Highest Lowest mechanism may be a bit unclear, here is
a more lengthy explanation using the diagram above. Let’s say players are
collecting the four icons in the image above—swords, fish, leaves, and grapes.
Player A has 10 swords, 5 fish, 7 leaves, and 2 grapes. Their final score will be
the lowest of those four—in this case the 2 grapes, so 2 points.
First used in Knizia’s Tigris & Euphrates, this scoring mechanism forces
players to pursue multiple paths equally. Specializing in gaining red, for
example, will not be a winning strategy. This forces players to generalize, and
typically encourages player interaction as they compete in the same areas.
Tigris & Euphrates has players collecting cubes of different colors to
determine the final score. When using cubes, this system is the same as
collecting sets of one of each color. Later implementations like Ingenious and
Wendake use tracks, which can make it easier to visualize the current score,
as it is just the lowest track marker.
Ingenious adds an additional twist, as while final scoring is based on the
lowest color value, during the game bonuses are awarded for getting a high
value of a particular color. So, tension is introduced between staying balanced
and specializing.

Game End and Victory

205

Wendake has two separate pairs of tracks, and the value of each pair is equal
to the lowest of the two. Then, the scores for each pair are added together to
determine the final score. Adding this additional level of detail groups certain
aspects together and opens up more strategic design space.

Uncertainty

ӶӶ
Games, like life, are full of uncertainty: the roll of the dice, the turn of a
card, the cube tumbling through the cube tower. But even in games of perfect
information, such as Chess, our opponents’ choices make our knowledge of
how the game will unfold, imperfect.
The source of uncertainty and how uncertainty is perceived contributes
much to the shape of the overall player experience. Uncertainty that comes
from a truly random process, like a die roll, creates a lighter and more
chaotic feeling for players—even if the design calls for throwing enough dice
enough times to smooth out the worst ends of the distribution curve. Players
participating in a rock-paper-scissors contest, however, will feel a greater sense
of agency and will harbor a belief, right or wrong, that the outcome of the
contest is not random.
Uncertainty lurks in many unexpected places. Can you rely on your
memory? Did the King of Hearts already go out? Did you properly deduce
where Jack the Ripper moved to? What is your partner signaling to you with
that drawing? Who is the werewolf? Can you balance Rhino Hero on the
next card up the tower?
Uncertainty can create chaos, but players can also manage uncertainty
using different tools. Betting, bluffing, and even deck-building all help
manage card-draw randomness. Letting players see the result of a random
process before needing to make a decision about it, such that the random
result is an input in their decision-making—input randomness—makes
randomness something players respond to, rather than rely on. On the other
hand, forcing players to make a high-stakes decision contingent on a random
outcome—output randomness—creates enormous drama and tension.

207

208

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Because uncertainty can have a powerful impact on the game experience,
designers often seek to control its influence in a variety of ways. In some
cases this is baked into the design itself, through the distribution of cards in
a deck, or the number of dice that must be rolled, and similar systemic design
elements. In many cases though, the power to mitigate uncertainty is given
to players. Dice manipulation powers, card- and deck-manipulation powers,
and other kinds of special abilities do give players greater agency.
While there is a loud contingent of players who disdain randomness and
luck in games, a word to the wise: the most successful commercial games
typically have far more luck in them than the most highly regarded hobby
games. Games with more uncertainty and randomness tend to be accessible
to more players, and facilitate enjoyment even when there are large skill
differences between players at the same table. Having a clear focus on the
intended market for your game will serve as a crucial guide in determining
how to handle uncertainty.
Designers have a broad palette of colors to paint with when it comes to the
sources of uncertainty, its framing, and how players experience it. Managing
uncertainty properly is key to the art of game design.

Betting and Bluffing

Description
Players commit a stake of currency or resources to purchase a chance of
winning everyone’s stake, based on some random outcome like being dealt a
superior set of cards or rolling a higher number. Players typically have partial
information about the overall game state, and may “bluff,” by representing
through their in-game actions that they hold a stronger position than they
do. Conversely, players may “fold,” or quit the contest, and limit their losses
to whatever they had already staked.

Discussion
Some of the oldest games in human memory are betting games, often
involving dice, and rather than try to recapitulate every type of betting game
and mechanism, we’ll restrict ourselves to how the mechanism is used in the
modern board-gaming context. Nevertheless, a field trip to your local casino
is highly recommended for extended study of these topics.
One common group of games that feature betting is trick-taking games,
like Tichu, where players place a “bet” by predicting the number of tricks they

210

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

will take. The role of betting in these designs is to allow players to self-balance
the outcomes of a random card deal. Players will bet more aggressively with a
stronger hand, Racing games like Camel Up offer wagering to allow players to
wager for the same reason. One might pedantically note that the game doesn’t
actually simulate or model camel racing as much as it models wagering on
camel races. Nevertheless, this is a very popular way for designers to make
games about racing, while sidestepping many of the challenges of modeling
an actual race.
The games above have wagering, without any real bluffing elements.
Conversely, there are games like Coup which feature bluffing, but not any
wagering. In Coup, players hold role cards that enable certain actions. These
cards are held in hand, as secret information, and a player can declare that
they possess any card, and take any connected action. As long as no player
challenges, the action occurs, but if a challenge is issued, the active player must
show the card they claimed and force the challenger to discard a role card,
or the player must discard one of their own role cards if they do not hold the
role card they claimed. Players who discard their last role cards are eliminated
from the game. This dynamic is present in many social deduction games,
which we discuss in a dedicated section (see “UNC-04” in this chapter).
Other games that are only about bluffing include Skull and Roses, Liar’s
Dice, Cockroach Poker and the classic game Cheat (which our saltier readers
may know by its more bovine name). What these games share in common
is that they have no currency to wager, and that when a player makes a
challenge, uncertainty exists only based upon player actions.
A key design element for including bluffing is hidden information, of course,
but also some form of information transmission. In poker, the information is
in the form of betting patterns, and the community cards visible on the table.
In Coup, the character a player chooses gives them special abilities. The actions
a player may perform based on the role give context to the choice, and the
possibility of the bluff. It is better if the hidden information doesn’t change
too frequently, to give a history to the choices a player makes. If the hidden
information constantly changes, it reduces the opportunities for players to try
to see through a bluff, leaving players with a random guessing game.
Bluffing is common in the party game space, but Wits & Wagers introduced
betting into the trivia genre. Players answer numbers-based questions and
arrange their numerical answers on a betting line in order from lowest to
highest. Players may then make two bets on which answer is closest to the
actual answer printed on the card. By cleverly allowing players to make two
wagers, the game expands from being only about how much confidence

Uncertainty

211

players have in their own knowledge to a richer set of choices. Players must
consider whether their wagers are revealing too much to their opponents,
while also looking to how other players bet to try and suss out likely answers
based on those betting patterns. If you’re playing with a doctor, for example,
you might follow their bets on biology and medical topics—until they catch
on to your strategy and lay a trap for you!
One of the most interesting places to find bluffing and wagering is in
modern resolution mechanisms for combat, some of which are discussed in
Chapter 4. In various games, players put forward some combination of known
strength, and some hidden amount of strength, and simultaneously reveal
and then resolve abilities to determine a winner. The hidden strength may
be represented by a number on a die, as in Tiny Epic Kingdoms, a leader card,
like in Dune, or a battle card, as in Kemet. Combat is entirely deterministic,
and all possible combat modifications are also known, such that in many
combats, players know which player will win if they spend their maximal
strength. The game is in out-thinking or out-guessing your opponent as to
how much strength he or she will spend. These combat systems are what we
might call all-pay, in that the committed resources are discarded. This is a key
distinction between auctions and wagers more generally: in auctions only the
winner pays, but in a wager, the losers pay.
The ability to read and out-guess your opponents, to know their minds,
is described by the Japanese word “Yomi.” Yomi is especially prominent
in games with a simultaneous reveal mechanism like 1v1 fighting games.
However, role-selection games (ACT-02) like Race for the Galaxy have this
flavor too: assessing which roles your opponents will select, and thus, which
you should select is the Yomi experience. In The Mind, that same notion is
pushed to the limit, but in a co-op game. In The Mind, players must, without
communicating, somehow play hands of cards in ascending numerical order.
There are no turns, and not all car ds are dealt from the deck, so players
must simply play based on their instincts and their ability to sense what their
partners might hold.

Push-Your-Luck

Description
Players must decide between settling for existing gains, or risking them all for
further rewards. Push-Your-Luck is also known as press-your-luck.

Discussion
A good example of a game whose central mechanism is Push-Your-Luck
is Sid Sackson’s Can’t Stop. In Can’t Stop, the active player rolls four dice
and advances up to two pawns in tracks numbered from 2 to 12, based on
matching the sum of any two dice to the numbers on the tracks. The player
may choose at any point to stop rolling, and lock in their progress along the
tracks, or reroll to attempt to advance again. However, if after rolling, the
player cannot match the sum of the dice to any of the three active tracks
the player is advancing on, the player “busts,” and all progress from that turn
is lost. Push-Your-Luck is a type of wager in which players have less control
over the ante or the stakes than in most casino games.

214

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

An important dynamic in push-your-luck games is how changes to the
stakes can alter player behavior. In Can’t Stop, when a player reaches the top
of any numbered track, the track is closed, and nobody else can score it. The
first player to reach the top of three tracks is the winner. Players may be more
timid at the start, but when one player is close to reaching the top of a track,
competitors also racing up that track usually become much more aggressive
and risk-tolerant, as they attempt to close the track themselves. This is doubly
so when a player is close to winning the game, and the other players try to
win it all themselves in one epic turn. When there’s nothing to lose, why not
press-your-luck?
Some of the behaviors and emotions that Sackson evokes in Can’t Stop
stems from behavior that echoes the sunk-cost fallacy, in which investing
additional resources into some goal is based not on the chances for succeeding,
or the expected return on the investment, but on an emotional connection
to what has already been invested in the past. In addition, Sackson is also
depending on the difficulty in computing probabilities in Can’t Stop. Avid
gamers, whether raised on Backgammon or Catan, are adept at calculating
probabilities featuring 2d6, but calculating the probabilities of successfully
rolling at least one of two or three different numbers on 4d6 is the kind of
thing that few players can do in their heads. This obfuscation is critical, since
games in which expected values can always be calculated exactly can feel stale
and boring.
Can’t Stop is unforgiving. A single miss, a single roll of the dice that fails to
advance a runner on a track, leads to a bust. In Yahtzee, players roll five dice,
and may choose to keep any number and reroll the rest before being forced
to score the results. However, players are limited to a total of three rolls. In
Favor of the Pharaoh there is an additional restriction that players must keep,
or lock, at least one die result before rerolling the remaining dice. In Tiny Epic
Galaxies players may spend a specific resource to purchase additional rerolls.
Alternatively, instead of focusing on the die roll, Push-Your-Luck can be
implemented in the chase for rewards. In Roll Through The Ages: The Iron
Age players race to build monuments, but the first player to complete the
monument will get a larger reward than all subsequent players. Players must
choose between participating in the race for monument completion, or
devoting their resources to a different pursuit. Similarly, in Incan Gold, (also
known by its original name, Diamant, which remains its European title)
players simultaneously choose whether to explore more deeply into a temple in
hopes of turning up more gems on the next turn of a card from the expedition
deck, or to leave. At first, there is no risk attached to staying in, but after the

Uncertainty

215

first of a type of hazard card is revealed the danger is that a matching hazard
will be revealed and all gems discovered will be lost. Players who leave early
get to retain all their gems gained so far, while players who remain will be
splitting new treasure with fewer players, making staying in the cave more
rewarding as well as riskier.
Formula De ties a player’s movement to gears represented by dice. Higher
gears allow players to roll dice with more sides, up to a D30 for top gear—
but curves offer a speed limit past which cars take damage. Take too much
damage and you’re out of the race!
Dice are a common means of implementing a press-your-luck mechanism,
but they are far from the only one, as per the aforementioned Incan Gold. In
Oh My Goods!, cards representing resources are played face-up into a market
row until two cards showing a half-sun icon are revealed. Players must assign
their workers after seeing one market row revealed, and can assign workers
to tasks that require more goods to be completed than are currently showing
in the market row. A second market row is then revealed, which may provide
sufficient resources for players to complete their work… or not! Notably,
the game allows players to assign workers to work in way that will yield the
maximum reward, which requires all resources be available, or to work for a
lesser reward, in which case a resource can be missing. This allows players to
choose the stakes and probabilities of their wager, while retaining the “bust”
outcome that characterizes these games.
Press-your-luck can be the central mechanism in a game, but it appears just
as frequently as a part of a larger game. In Ra, players draw tiles from a bag to
create an auction lot. Prior to each draw, the active player may call an auction,
but auctions are more often triggered when a Ra tile is drawn out of the bag.
There are multiple dimensions of luck-pressing baked into play: tiles are worth
different amounts to players based on a set-collection mechanism (see “Set
Collection” in Chapter 12), some tiles will impact players negatively, while
other tiles are highly desirable to all players. Drawing another tile instead
of calling the auction can radically change the overall value of the lots, and
change them differently for each player. Towards the end of the round, when
only one player remains, that player continues drawing tiles until he or she
wishes to stop and purchase the lot. However, if a Ra tile is drawn at this
point, the round ends immediately and the player loses his or her opportunity
to buy. It is not uncommon to hear chants of “Ra! Ra! Ra!” during this phase
of a game, demonstrating how meaningful the stakes feel in this masterpiece.
Ra’s Push-Your-Luck mechanism permeates the whole game, yet it is
clearly in service to the auction-and-set-collection core. In many games, the

216

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Push-Your-Luck element is a layer of flair rather than a core of the experience.
In Mystic Vale, a kind of deck-building game (see “CAR-05” in Chapter 13)
players flop cards to establish their mana pool for the turn, until three spoils
symbols are showing on the cards. Players may choose to risk flopping an
additional card to expand their mana pool, but if another spoils symbol
shows, the player busts and loses his or her turn. This mechanism is entirely
optional and additive, and players can play and win without ever engaging
in it, but it can be wisely leveraged to accelerate a deck’s construction too.
Push-Your-Luck as a mechanism is straightforward to understand, even
if the risks can be difficult to calculate, and it easily creates drama, tension,
and excitement. It should be considered an essential part of every designer’s
toolkit.

Memory

Description
Hidden, trackable information whose tracking gives players an advantage.

Discussion
Memory can be a game mechanism, or a capability a player draws upon when
engaging with one or more mechanisms. It’s an important design ingredient, a
lever whose setting will have substantial impact on a game’s weight, intended
audience, and general reception. Our discussion will focus on games where
memory is at the center of the game design, rather than where memory is an
ancillary skill that the game tests.
Memory games can be seen on a spectrum. At one end, are games like
the classic game Memory and the modern game The Magic Labyrinth, in
which the only skill the core game mechanism tests is whether players can
remember things. In Memory, it’s the specific location of various items in the
face-down grid of tiles. In The Magic Labyrinth, players need to remember the
correct path through the maze, because the walls of the maze are invisible, and
the game uses magnets on the underside of the board to define that path.
Memoarrr! borrows a bit from both of these games, with cards that feature
two elements that must be remembered, and then arranged spatially.
Further down this spectrum are games where memory is crucial to the
core gameplay in patent and obvious ways. Stratego and Lord of the Rings:
The Confrontation feature player pieces on standees or blocks. These pieces
have unit information on only one side, such that players can’t see the identities
of opposing pieces before they encounter them. In an encounter, players reveal

218

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

the pieces, then flip them back, leaving the players to use their memories to
track the location and identity of the revealed pieces. These games have fairly
small and stripped-down rulesets that put the spotlight squarely on memory,
but block-style war games like Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan use this
same mechanism to add fog of war—the uncertainty of the disposition of
enemy forces that is typical in war.
This type of memory mechanism, sometimes called “Hidden Trackable
Information” (HTI), for short, challenges players to remember information
that was once revealed to them. We’ve discussed positional examples so far, but
those examples are perhaps the least polarizing. In Small World, players must
announce how many coins (i.e., victory points or VPs) they have collected
at the end of their turn, but not their total. It would be trivial to track this
information with a paper and pencil, but in the context of a fast-moving game
of territory control, it’s easy for players to lose track of who is ahead. This is
intentional on the part of the game designer! Small World is the successor
to Vinci, a Roman-themed game that is mechanically almost identical. One
key change between the two games was making the victory points hidden,
trackable information. This helped to prevent dynamics which plagued Vinci:
bash-the-leader behavior, and the extent to which players optimized their play
on the last turn. This change, along with cute art and a lighthearted feeling,
turned Small World into an evergreen success in the casual games space.
Another example of HTI is found in El Grande. In addition to placing
cubes onto the board, players may choose to place them into the Castillo, a
tall tower. Players cannot look in the Castillo, they need to remember how
many cubes are there. At the end of the round, each player secretly selects a
province in which to place his or her Castillo cubes. Remembering how many
cubes of each player are in the tower can be challenging—even remembering
how many of your own are in there can be difficult for players. But this lends
a fun, swingy punctuation to what otherwise is a very calculable game.
HTI can be especially controversial when it exists in more complex games,
but it is nonetheless common in 18xx games and other heavy economic or
auction games (see “Economics” in Chapter 7 and “Auctions” in Chapter 8,
respectively), where player or corporate cash holdings are hidden. To some
extent, this thematically reflects the ways in which corporations are secretive
about their finances. Mechanically, pricing an auction or predicting an
opponent’s actions is much simpler when the total money in the system is
known, and is even easier when the allocation of that money is known.
Memory and HTI sharply reduce accessibility and inclusion. To help players
who have trouble remembering, many games provide tracking components,

Uncertainty

219

like Clue’s guessing pad. Other games provide some aid to memory, like Hunt
for the Ring, where the Nazgul players have a handful of tokens with different
markings that they can use as they wish. In Hanabi, the rules explicitly
encourage players to find a limit on communications that maximized the
fun for the group. This leaves open an enormous range of possibilities, from
playing Hanabi as a strict memory game where each individual must keep
track of his or her own hand, to one with almost no memory component since
players are free to remind one another what each of them has been clued to in
his or her own hands previously. Even under such rules, however, players must
remember when they were clued about the state of their hands, and which
new cards they have drawn since then.
Many games rely heavily on memory, even though they’re not explicitly
memory games, and players with better memory (or card-counting systems)
will have a substantial advantage. Trick-taking games and classic card games
in general fall into this category, since players who can remember which cards
have already been played can make better decisions about what to play next,
and the relative values of cards still in their hands. Another common dynamic
is games in which remembering the types of sets your opponent is collecting
allows you to interfere with them effectively, as in Animals On Board. In these
games, cards or tiles collected by players are hidden away after collection. These
are important design considerations, but they relate to memory as a player skill,
rather than as a game mechanism. Admittedly, the line between these two is
fuzzy, but we will wrap our discussion of memory mechanisms here.

Hidden Roles

Description
One or more players are assigned differing roles that are not publicly revealed
at the start of the game.

Discussion
While uncertainty lurks in many games, in Hidden Roles games, uncertainty
is at the very heart of the gameplay. We can broadly talk about three types of
Hidden Roles games: social deduction games, traitor games, and competing
roles games. We touched on this topic earlier in the chapter about game
structure (see Chapter 1). Social deduction games are team games in which
the object of gameplay is to deduce the team allegiances of the players, like
in the classic open-source game Mafia (which, ten years after its invention,
was recast as Werewolf ).
It’s worth noting that in these games, usually only one team faces uncertainty.
The werewolves know who all the villagers are, and as such, the werewolves
are playing a role-playing game whose win condition is to successfully deceive
the villagers for long enough to devour them. The villagers are playing a
deduction game where the evidence is mostly in the social interactions at
the table rather than the almost non-existent mechanical interactions. In
this section, we’ll generically refer to the “villagers” to represent the team,
typically positioned as the thematic protagonists, that has less knowledge of

Uncertainty

221

the game state, and “werewolves” to describe their opponents, who know the
identities of most or all players.
Shadow Hunters, Two Rooms and a Boom, and BANG! are exceptions to this
general rule. In these games, the players do not know the identities of any of
the other players (except for the Sheriff in BANG!, who is known to all). This
gives these games a different feel, as there is less paranoia, as all players are on
an equal footing, and an early part of the game is players trying to determine
who is on their team without tipping their hand.
Traitor games, as distinct from social deduction games, have some
other win condition for the “villager” side besides revealing the traitors.
In Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, players try to reach Korhol
(or some other destination), and the game operates like a cooperative game
(see “STR-02” in Chapter 1). However, a traitor may lurk among the players,
secretly sabotaging them. In traitor games, the traitor, upon discovery or
self-revelation, often shifts into a different role with a new win condition,
new actions, and different player powers.
Traitor games need to use hidden resolution systems so that players can
cause trouble while maintaining anonymity. In Battlestar, players play cards
face-down during the crisis phase, trying to sum up to a value of cards of a
certain color. Because the cards are played face-down, the traitor can sabotage
the crisis resolution effort without revealing himself or herself; although,
through deduction, the other players may start to uncover their identity. Dark
Moon has players roll dice behind a screen. Each player must select one die to
use to resolve the action. Traitors may use their worst rolls so as not to benefit
the team, but showing a bad roll does not guarantee a traitor, as a loyal player
may just have a bad roll and have no good dice to choose from.
In our final category, competing roles games, players are not on fixed teams,
and have hidden identities, but revealing those identities is not directly tied to
winning or losing. Ravenous River and Coup are examples of competing roles
games. In Ravenous River, each player is secretly assigned one of seven animal
identities. Animals eat one other type of animal and are in turn eaten by one
other type. Players use cards to manipulate the positions of any animals, not
just their animal, seeking to end the round in the same region as their prey
and not their predator. Deducing the identities of the other players can help
in executing a strategy, but isn’t worth any points towards victory.
The uncertainty in all of these types of games is not the operational
uncertainty of attempting an outcome without knowing whether it will
succeed, but it still is a kind of output randomness that injects noise between
a player’s intention and the results of his or her action. In Mascarade, player

222

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

roles can move around from player to player, such that a player may not know
what role he or she has at any given time, which creates a lot of uncertainty.
Like in Coup, players can claim the actions associated with any role, but
unlike in Coup, roles can get shuffled and players may not look at their own
role cards freely; they must spend their turn doing so.
An important source of uncertainty in social deduction games in particular
is in the unstructured conversation during which players discuss potential
targets and coordinate for the upcoming resolution phase, typically a vote.
The conversation phase offers players opportunities to lie, obfuscate, bluff,
posture, or hide in a shroud of silence. Experientially, this phase is crucial,
and whether players enjoy this genre of game rests largely on how much they
enjoy this part of the game.
Some games attempt to enforce some structure in the discussion phase, by
creating mechanisms with in-game consequences that players must grapple
with. In Salem 1692, players play action cards on one another that impact
status and abilities, including accusation cards that operate in place of the
voting phase of other social deduction games. In Shadow Hunters players
give cards with yes/no questions to other players, which they must answer.
In Ravenous River, as mentioned above, a player may have the opportunity
to manipulate the positions of a few animals, including animals other than
themselves. These actions, and their potential point-scoring consequences,
provide evidence of the player’s secret identity. This is related to hidden endgame goals (VIC-06).
We’ve touched briefly on Werewolf in its most basic form. However, its most
popular commercial iterations, such as Ultimate Werewolf, and The Resistance:
Avalon, feature a dizzying array of additional roles, each of which change the
dimensions and possibilities of gameplay. Some roles offer players additional
private information about other players and their roles or team identities.
Others can protect players from being eliminated, which injects performative
uncertainty into the elimination action. Some roles provide an elimination
power, which can be helpful to the “villager” side, but might actually cloud
the situation and make it more difficult to assess who the “werewolves” are
because players don’t know which team eliminated which players.
There’s much more to be said about the various types of roles possible
in these kinds of games, which is beyond the scope of this work. However,
one role is critical to consider: the role of the moderator. In many social
deduction games, the need to hide substantial aspects of the game state from
a shifting set of audiences makes these games inherently fragile and subject
to inadvertent revealing of information, or even tolerance for some mild

Uncertainty

223

cheating. Because these games also have unstructured conversation phases,
driving the game towards conclusion can sometimes be difficult. That’s why
many of these games call for a moderator who does not play the game, at
least in the sense that the moderator can neither win nor lose, but simply
administrates the game, and especially enforces time limits, whether formal
and agreed upon or informal and socially accepted.
Since the moderator is the only person who knows the complete game
state, playing as the moderator can be quite appealing to players who
enjoy spectating and people-watching. The moderator role can also be
performed with theatricality, and has an element of role-playing that sits
in its own layer of game-engagement that is separate from the core game
engine. And of course, like any refereeing role, the moderator can have both
unintentional and intentional impacts on the course of the game through
their manipulation of soft power, like when to call a discussion to a close
and insist on a vote.
Perhaps for these reasons, the moderator role has been eliminated in
many modern designs. In One Night Ultimate Werewolf, a prerecorded voice,
run by an app, takes players through the paces of each round, such that
a moderator is not required. In Dracula’s Feast, both the moderator and
the idea of player elimination are removed, and players have asymmetric
win conditions, some of which are not tied to discovering other players,
but to being accused of inhabiting certain roles. These differences put the
game firmly into the competing roles category, rather than social deduction
category. In order to get around the problem of sharing information
secretly, players each have a “Yes” and “No” card that they can show to the
one player asking them a question. These games can often have multiple
players winning by fulfilling different conditions. Two Rooms and a Boom
is particularly instructive in this area.
Voting-based player elimination is very common in social deduction
games, and that mechanism can create negative social consequences. From
the perspective of a cultural critic, these games are intended to recreate
uncomfortable social and political realities like mob justice, betrayal, and
schoolyard cliques. Some games lean into these dynamics, like Secret Hitler,
which not only requires that players step into a magic circle where they may
have to self-identify as a Nazi, or as Hitler himself, but must also participate in
a morally gray universe in which even non-Fascists might pass Fascist policies.
Designers need to take care that players understand the nature of the magic
circle that they’re stepping into, and what might be expected of them in their
suspension of real-world rules during play.

Roles with Asymmetric Information

Description
One or more players are secretly assigned roles at the start of the game which
have different win conditions, and receive different starting information
about the game state.

Discussion
In Hidden Roles (UNC-04) we speak of games where the “werewolves” have
complete or nearly complete knowledge of the identities of the other players.
The opposite dynamic is also possible, where the “werewolf” may know the
identities of the other players, but is missing some other critical information
that all the other players share. Generally, the goal for the “werewolf” is to
figure out that secret, and the goal for the “villagers” is to both keep that
secret safe and to guess the identity of the “werewolf.” In some games, one
or the other is sufficient to secure the victory for the “villagers” and in others
both are required.
In Spyfall, for example, players are told that they are at one of many
potential locations. One player, the spy, doesn’t know the location, but their
identity as the spy is hidden from the other players. The spy attempts to

226

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

deduce the location all the players are at, while the other players attempt to
figure out who the spy is, through asking and answering questions related in
some way to the location. Non-spy players must be careful to ask and answer
in a way that signals only to other players that they know the location, without
giving it away to the spy. The spy must ask and answer questions in a manner
that doesn’t draw suspicion, even though they don’t know where they are!
Another example that introduces a third role with Asymmetric Information
is A Fake Artist Goes to New York. In this game, the moderator is a player, and
also wins or loses. The moderator chooses both a category and the secret word
within the category, and chooses who the fake artist will be by revealing only
the category to them, but not the secret word. The other players then each
begin play, adding one line to a shared drawing on their turn, attempting to
signal to other players that they know what the secret word is.
Similar to Spyfall, the players don’t want to give away what they’re drawing,
since the fake artist wins if they can guess the secret word. The moderator is
aligned with the fake artist, and is thus incentivized to choose a category and
word that will make it easy for the fake artist to correctly guess the word.
The moderator is the only player at the table with complete knowledge of the
game state.
There is a genre of games which leverages this same type of informational
asymmetry, but with less emphasis on player roles. For example, games in
which cards or tiles are held facing out, like Hanabi and Abracada… What?,
don’t put players into different roles, but each player is denied knowledge of
only their own hand. Each of these is subtly different: Abracada… What? is
closest to Spyfall in that each player faces the tension of acting despite ignorance,
but there is no doubt as to the player’s identity or goals in the game from the
perspective of the other players. Hanabi is cooperative, and the dramatic irony
that the inactive players feel because they can see the active player’s hand as
they agonize over the right play is part of what makes that game special.
The mass-market game Headbanz, in which one player tries to guess at
a word on a card that all the other players can see, leverages this type of
hidden information that isolates a single player, whether for the whole game
or just for their turn, through sharp informational asymmetry. So does the
absurdist Win, Lose or Banana, where the player who draws the “Win” card
tries to guess which player holds the Banana card, but is the only player who
doesn’t know the disposition of all the cards. What’s notable about these
games is that the social dynamic of being the only person not in the know
creates enormous pressure, tension, and the possibility for humor—often at
one player’s expense.

Uncertainty

227

This technique does not have to be used only in competitive games.
Cooperative games may put communication restrictions on one or
more players, and challenge them to convey information to other players
(STR-02). Mysterium places one player in the role of a ghost, who needs to
get the other players to correctly identify the elements of a mystery (location,
person, and weapon), but can only communicate by playing one or more
elaborately illustrated cards to the players as a “dream.”
Though hidden information not generated by player actions is everywhere,
little of it exists in classic European style games. Though we often draw the
line between these styles based on whether they employ input randomness or
output randomness, the element of having only public information also aligns
closely with the European design school.

Communication Limits

Description
Games may limit players from communicating with one another openly. These
restrictions can be absolute as they relate to certain specific pieces of information,
or they may restrict certain types of communication, such as speaking.

Discussion
Communication limits are most common in cooperative games, but they exist
in other kinds of games as well. Many games limit players from revealing
privately held cards. In Cosmic Encounter, players may openly discuss which
cards they intend to play, but the actual cards cannot be shown, in order to
preserve the possibility of a double-cross. In traitor games, identity cards are
an obvious example of communication limits.
In cooperative games or games with intra-team cooperation, communication
limits operate to make the game more difficult. Party games like Charades,
Pictionary, and Show & Tile, all ask players to communicate non-verbally,
with pantomime, drawing, or building with tangrams, respectively. These
games are all games of inductive reasoning, where the clues provided suggest
an answer. Hanabi is particularly notable in that the more players come to the
game with agreed-upon principles and conventions for how to play, the more
the game shifts from being about inductive reasoning to deductive reasoning.
Games with deduction mechanisms, in which players gain information by
asking specific types of questions—like Clue or hidden movement games like
Specter Ops—are another example of communication limits as a mechanism
to manage uncertainty, preserving enough of it for interesting play.
Returning to Hanabi, players are restricted not only in the type of
information they are allowed to provide, or the modality by which it may be

Uncertainty

229

provided, but also by frequency with which they may communicate. Players
have a limited number of clues, and if no clues are available players may
not communicate at all. Mysterium takes a similar approach, except that
communication is only limited between certain player roles. The ghost and the
mediums may only swap information through cards, but the mediums may
freely converse with one another. In Witness, players may only communicate
their information once, which leaves players unable to confirm what they’ve
heard or clarify anything they might have missed.
In the absence of specific rules of what information can be shared, play
groups are left to manage themselves. In The Game, the rules indicate that
players may not share the specific values of cards in their hands, but may say
“don’t play on that pile” or “don’t make a large jump on this pile.” In practice,
this can often lead to results very similar to players playing with open hands,
especially when players at the table have different ideas about what should and
should not be allowed. This dynamic is on full display in The Mind, where
the rules bar all communication, yet the gameplay is all about reading the
slightest and most subconscious of cues. Once again, each group will have
very different mores and norms by which they play.

Unknown Information

Description
Aspects of the game state are unknown to all players, but lie within a known
range.

Discussion
There are three categories of hidden-yet-knowable information: information
known to no players, information known to one or more players, and
information known to all but one player.
Unknown Information creates uncertainty during any given play of a
game, and creates variety in repeated plays. Event decks are a good example
of this kind of uncertainty. Players know the range of possible results, and
often the cadence by which information will be revealed, but they don’t
know the specifics, and the specifics can substantially impact strategy. In an
initial play, players may not even know the true range of possibilities, and
indeed, some game instructions encourage players to look through the deck
to familiarize themselves with the possibilities, or provide a card manifest or
similar catalog of possibilities. Pandemic’s infection deck generates enormous
tension precisely because the uppermost cards, formerly the discard pile, are
known to the players.
How unknown information will impact players on reveal can vary
mechanically too. When modeling exploration, like the face-down sector tiles
of Eclipse, explored tiles are revealed to all players. In Karuba, a new path tile
is revealed each turn but each player may use the tile differently, either adding
it to their personal board or discarding it for movement. Cards that enter a
market, like the ability cards in King of Tokyo, can be seen by all players, but
an acquisition mechanism limits and determines who can take advantage of

Uncertainty

231

them. In tile-laying games like Carcassonne, where players don’t have a hand,
the new tile drawn is known to all players, but only one player has agency
over its placement.

Hidden Information

Description
Aspects of the game state are hidden from all but one or a few players.

Discussion
Information can be known to one or more players, but not to all players. This
includes information we’ve covered elsewhere, like Hidden Roles (UNC-04),
or private hands of cards. However, in this context, we refer less to those sets
of information which are permanent elements of a player’s role in a game,
like their hand of cards. Instead, we’re considering things like the strength
of the monsters that all players can battle for victory points in Champions
of Midgard. The types of information that may be hidden in this manner
typically fall into a few categories: secret player abilities, secret goals, strength
of enemies, and the location of specific items or resources. Players might
spend actions or resources to gain this knowledge, or not. Another type of
information of this sort is specific knowledge of another player’s hand based
on deduction. If you hold the Princess in Love Letter, you can be certain
that nobody else does, but no other player can be certain about whether the
Princess is in your hand, any other player’s hand, or the draw deck.
Designers employ a variety of mechanisms and components to manage
hiding and revealing this kind of information. Cards are especially common,
as in Clue, where players respond to an accusation by showing a disproving
card only to the accusing player. Other options include face-down cards,
player screens, tokens with common backs but different fronts, and figures
with information on the bottom of their bases. More exotically, in Pikoko, a
competitive trick-taking game, players hold their hands facing out, so each

Uncertainty

233

player can see every card in hand, except those held in their own hand. Careers
begins with players selecting their own victory conditions as a mixture of
Fame, Happiness, and Money, and recording it on their personal play sheet.
These techniques can help add new layers of strategy for advanced players.
Once players understand what the range of the hidden information is, they can
try to deduce what it is from players who know it. This also offers opportunity
for bluffing. For example, paying attention to what elements players include in
a guess in Clue may give astute players knowledge of what cards other players
have been shown. But knowing that players may be looking out for that may
cause advanced players to continue to include elements in their guesses that
they think will lead their opponents to draw erroneous conclusions.

Probability Management

Description
Mechanism which allows players to influence the probabilities of certain
outcomes, but not directly determine them.

Discussion
Probability Management is intrinsic to all dice and card games. At its most
direct, players can gain dice modifier tokens that allow them to add or
subtract from the value of a die, as in Kingsburg or Sagrada. More obliquely,
in Backgammon players can move their blots (the name given to the checkers)
into positions that minimize the probabilities of good rolls for their opponents
and maximize those probabilities themselves.
Betting games allow players to assign stakes to probabilistic events like dice
rolls or card deals. However, the type of Probability Management we’ll cover
here is exemplified by deck-building games. In a deck-building game, such as
the progenitor of the genre, Dominion, players draw a hand of cards from a
private deck each turn, and play those cards to acquire other, more powerful
cards, usually from a central market. Players try to acquire more powerful
cards, and cards that synergize together. By keeping the deck tuned so that
draws consistently surface those cards, players seek to increase the average
output of their deck, in whatever terms—currency at the start of a game, and
victory point later is a typical framework. We’ll discuss Deck-Building in
depth in its own section (CAR-05).
Some games offer probability manipulation at rarified skill levels. In
Twilight Struggle, some cards leave the game after being played for their
events. High-level players are careful not to trigger cards showing their

Uncertainty

235

own events, and to trigger, in as safe a manner as possible, their opponent’s
events. Over time, the weight of the deck shifts and forces the opponent into
many difficult hand-management situations where they must trigger highly
damaging events. In Alhambra, players can draw currency into their hands,
either by taking a single card, or any number of cards adding up to no more
than 5. Players gain a bonus action when purchasing tiles with exact change,
and a great deal of the skill in this game lies in managing a hand that can
match many values. Failure to realize this aspect of gameplay results in a
substantial loss of player agency.

Variable Setup

Description
The starting game state varies from game to game, through changes to shared
game components like the map, and/or or changes to starting player setups,
resources, objectives, etc.

Discussion
Variable Setup is sometimes equated with replayability, and can certainly
contribute to it, though they are not the same thing. The line between setup
and gameplay isn’t always that clear either. But setup can have an outsize
effect on uncertainty and overall game outcomes. Catan’s rules recommend
new players play with a specific board layout, and provide rules for board
construction that ensure that no one spot is over-powered relative to others.
Players often ignore this rule, and this imbalanced setup can easily advantage
one player over the other. Similarly, the randomly dealt alien powers in Cosmic
Encounter define the game almost entirely, and shape its dynamics even more
dramatically than Catan’s setup. Dominion’s selection of ten kingdom cards is
similarly impactful—those cards can be considered the last page of the rules.
In many cases, variable setups don’t impact uncertainty once setup is
complete, because nothing that happens in the game is probabilistically
dependent on setup. After faction board tops and bottoms are selected in
Scythe, for example, there is no further uncertainty. This is as distinguished
from Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, where more interactions are
available with the loyalty deck, and the makeup of that deck can change
prior to the next loyalty phase.
Some variable setups incorporate hidden or unknown information. In
Specter Ops, the runner who is trying to evade the hunters gets to secretly select
a few equipment cards out of the available pool. In theory, hunters can know

Uncertainty

237

the complete set of equipment cards and how they work, though whether
that’s true in practice—whether players do in fact look in the rulebook to read
about all the equipment—is questionable. Designers should provide player
aids summarizing this type of information if it’s important that players know
all the possibilities.
Designers need to be careful that randomized setups don’t create balance
issues. This is particularly true in longer games. Often, having limitations on
the randomization (like redoing a setup if a certain number of the same type
of tile are placed in a row), or giving players a pregame chance to respond
to the random setup is required. An example of the latter is found in Catan,
where there is a snake draft for placement of player’s initial settlements. This
allows players to moderate the vagaries of the initial chance board setup.

Hidden Control

Description
Players have hidden influence on locations or characters, which they reveal
to perform actions.

Discussion
In a game of this kind, play is divided up between assigning influence
and either declaring or spending that influence to trigger the effects of the
character or location in question. In Mythology, players secretly assign control
points to heroes (or monsters, events, etc.) in one phase. In a later phase in
the round, any player may attempt to activate these heroes by announcing
that they are taking control. If nobody challenges that control, the action
succeeds. If another player challenges, the players engage in an auction-like
process of declaring an amount of control points that they had previously
assigned. Players may choose to reveal none, some, or all of the control points
they have assigned in an effort to take control of the hero, and the player who
reveals the most influence is awarded control.
In Kremlin, players influence politicians in the Soviet party, each of whom
can trigger certain actions based on their altitude in the party hierarchy.

Uncertainty

239

Players write down influence they assign to politicians on a secret log sheet and
then reveal some or all of the claimed influence to control these politicians.
Revealed politicians are targets for exile, or, in some versions of the game,
execution by the KGB, so players must balance the risks and rewards of
revealing control.
This mechanism can also be used as part of a traditional public influence
system. In Colossal Arena, players bet on battling creatures. The player who
has placed the highest value of bets on a creature may use its special ability.
However, at the start of the game, each player may place a secret bet on a
single creature. Timing when to reveal your secret bet to seize control of a
creature is a key tactic in the game.
This kind of revealed influence is an uncommon mechanism, perhaps
because it requires a log sheet or some other form of tracking, which can be
cumbersome. It is also fragile to player deception that is hard to discover. But,
used judiciously or with proper physical techniques, it can be compelling.
This is perhaps an area that will be explored more in digital hybrid games.

Economics

ӶӶ
In one sense, games are about gaining and using assets to achieve victory.
Maximizing efficiency, utilization, and value are all important as players strive
to win.
Many things can be considered “assets” in a game. They can be obvious,
like money in Monopoly, and goods like bricks or grain in Catan. Or they can
be capital assets, like properties or buildings that generate other resources, or
intangible, like turn order, board position, network efficiency, or hand size.
In this text we will use the generic term “asset” to represent any of these.
The term “resource” will refer to money and goods, and not structures or
intangibles.
Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. It is not
surprising that many aspects of business and economics are adapted into
board-game mechanisms. In this chapter we examine a variety of mechanisms
that derive from manipulating resources and other sources of value.

241

242

ECO-01

Exchanging

Description
Players Exchange a set of assets for a different set with the bank.

Discussion
While traditionally this mechanism is thought of as Exchanging similar types
of resources, for example Exchanging two sheep for a wood at a sheep port in
Catan, under the expansive definition of assets, it also covers purchasing as a
mechanism. For example, in Monopoly players exchange the asset money for
the asset property. Similar considerations apply, so they are both covered here.
Often there are fixed formulas for exchanges. Again using Catan as an
example, a Road costs a Brick and a Grain, and a Town costs a Brick, Grain,
Wool, and Wood. These types of requirements can be used to give relative

Economics

243

value to different paths, or add an arc, as different resources may be required
in different ways under different strategies or at varying points of the game.
What was valuable early may become less so later on.
Some systems feature hierarchical organization of resources. For example,
in Roads and Boats, Wood is used to make Boards, Boards make Fuel, Fuel
and Gold make Coins, and Coins and Paper make Stock Certificates. As is
typical in this style of game, each of these transformations is a one-way trip.
Another example of hierarchical resources is Century: Spice Road. In this
game, yellow turmeric cubes are the least valuable, followed by red saffron cubes,
green cardamom cubes, and then the most valuable brown cinnamon cubes. In
this case, exchanges are possible (and common) between all levels. Certain cards
allow conversion of a brown cube back into several yellow and red cubes.
Hierarchical systems give players a clear sense of value. However, if this
value is too clear, other mechanisms need to be introduced to obstruct players
from getting use out of that value. Otherwise, the resources are basically
fungible like coins of different denominations. For example, in Century: Spice
Road players may exchange cubes for the Victory Card resource. The point
value of those cards is strictly equal to the value of the cubes, from one point
for yellow cubes, up to four points for brown cubes. Although not explicitly
stated, this 1–4 valuation of colors helps players quickly determine the relative
value of the converter cards. One that turns a green (value 3) into a brown and
yellow (value 4 + 1 = 5) gives a net gain of +2. A card that turns a red into
a green has a value of +1. While the value of the cards is known, the players
need to collect cards that enable them to perform exchanges as efficiently as
possible to get the specific set of cubes required by the victory card. Thus time
becomes another resource that players must consider when determining the
value of exchanges.
Non-hierarchical systems allow players to transform resources in different
directions, laterally. The sheep-port in Catan that was mentioned earlier is
an example. At that port, any other commodity may be obtained by turning
in two sheep. Permitting lateral exchange of resources gives a system more
flexibility and allows players to specialize, as focusing on just a few resources
will not limit them from getting others they may require.

Trading

Description
Players may Trade assets with each other.

Discussion
This is a form of Exchanging (ECO-01), except that players determine the
terms of the exchange. In order for Trading to work, the resources being traded
need to have different value to different players. This is often accomplished
through the use of Sets. See Chapter 12 for full details on the supporting
mechanisms. The value also needs to be difficult to precisely determine.
Again, sets are often used to accomplish this, as players may not know exactly
which cards their opponent has. Future value can also be obfuscated, usually
based on random future events.
Games typically limit what can be traded. For example, Civilization
gives players Commodity cards, and only those may be traded. In Sidereal
Confluence, on the other hand, where a variety of types of resources may be
combined in different deals. Sometimes games will strictly require like-forlike trades (e.g., two cards for two cards).
The actual mechanism of Trading can be conducted in several ways. Most
common is a defined open Trading session, where players shout out deals and
proposals, as in Civilization, Trade on the Tigris, Sidereal Confluence, and many
other games. Open Trading is fun and chaotic but has several downsides. First,
trade phases tend to be time-consuming, as players haggle. It can also leave

246

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

out players who don’t have many things to trade or are otherwise uninvolved.
Also, players who are less assertive may suffer a handicap. For these reasons,
Trade Phases often are timed, and players may only make deals within those
windows. If players can make a trade at any point during the game, it may
lengthen the game noticeably, and also lead to odd timing effects—what if
the players can trade between a combat resolution, and removal of casualties?
Questions that are not covered by the rules are likely to arise and outright
exploits may lurk beneath the surface.
However, there are games that allow Trading at any time. Monopoly is a
good example.
Another consideration in trades is the truthfulness factor. Most games
require some level of truth on the part of the players. In Civilization, players
must tell the truth about two cards out of the minimum of three they are
required to include in a trade. They may say whatever they would like about
the others. In Trade on the Tigris, each trade card has a top and bottom half
with different resources. Players must tell the truth about the top but may say
anything about the bottom. Introducing deception elements into the trade
mechanism can add some spice and excitement, but some players will feel
uncomfortable about it, and others will simply not have a poker face.
Regardless, however, when Trading resources, the deal typically must be
performed as defined. Because of this, most games ban future promises as
part of a trade, as it is difficult to police, and requires rules for what happens
if an agreement cannot be fulfilled. This is in contrast with Negotiations,
where players often do not do what they promise (ECO-18). It is also worth
mentioning that introducing Trading gives players a tool to self-balance a
game. If one player is in the lead, others may refuse to trade with them,
or force them to accept less favorable trade. This is a soft Catch-the-Leader
mechanism (VIC-18).

Market

Description
Players may buy from or sell resources to Markets, where prices and quantities
can vary.

Discussion
Markets are a specialized form of Exchanging (ECO-01), as players are typically
exchanging stocks or commodities for money, all of which are resources.
However, there are some specific considerations for this implementation,
particularly around changing prices. Note that we are defining a Market
mechanism as one where prices change. Mechanisms like that, found in
Concordia, where you can buy or sell for a fixed value throughout the game
would fall under Exchange, even though it is called a Market.
One mechanism for varying prices is using a track as in Supremacy, where
there is a price track for each commodity, with a marker indicating the current
buy/sell price. If a player sells that commodity the price is reduced, and if they
buy it the price increases. If a player buys or sells multiple units, all units can

248

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

either be sold at the same price prior to adjustment (as in Supremacy), or it
can drop one space with each good sold (as in Crude). While the latter makes
it more difficult for players to exploit the system, it makes the calculations a
bit more complex.
Price tracks can be 2-dimensional grids, as in the 18xx series. In those
games, selling shares makes prices move down within a pricing column, while
issuing dividends moves it to another column with a different price scale. This
gives more fine-grained control to the design, and there can be special effects
when the price hits the top or bottom of a row or column.
Rather than have a marker record the current price, the actual commodity
tokens can do so. This is done by placing one commodity per space on the
pricing track. The price of the commodity is based on the farthest space up
the track covered by the commodity, or sometimes the farthest visible space.
As commodities are bought, higher price spaces are revealed, and as they
are sold, the higher price spaces are covered so the price drops. Visually, the
former method usually calls for numbers to be printed above or below the
track spaces, which takes up more room, while the latter allows the numbers
to be printed on the track spaces themselves.
This elegant track system is used in Crude, Power Grid, and others. When
players take a resource off the track, they simultaneously are adjusting the
pricing for that resource, without having to remember to do anything else.
Wealth of Nations adds a twist in that the buy and sell prices are not the same
in each space. There is a delta that creates friction in the market system.
Markets can sometimes be one-way ratchets. In Acquire, players may only
buy shares from the market, not sell them. And as the hotel chains they
represent expand, the price of the shares goes up, and can never go down. In
other cases, like Rococo, prices for thread and fabric go down throughout the
course of the turn, decreasing as each player makes purchases. This ostensibly
models the decline of prices in a bazaar as closing time approaches and is also
helpful for balancing first-player turn-order advantage.
Market systems create a lot of player interaction, as players may attempt
to manipulate the price to their advantage or deprive their opponent the
ability to gain needed resources. They also help to self-balance resource
production. If one resource is being over-produced or under-used by
the players, the price will be driven downwards, and players will adjust
accordingly. In a system where the physical resource tokens are placed on
the market track, they may even become completely unavailable if players
are hoarding them.

Delayed Purchase

Description
Items that are purchased do not enter play right away but arrive on a future turn.

Discussion
In most games, when you purchase an item, it is immediately available to
use. However, in the real world, it can take time to produce something, or
get something delivered.
Several games use this Delayed Purchase mechanic to force players to plan
ahead. A simple implementation is to place purchased items directly on a

Economics

251

turn track, and they become available when the turn marker moves into that
space. This can also be done with a specialized production or training track,
where units are advanced one box each turn. This was used in Time War,
where Teams are trained by advancing them through a schematic of a training
facility. Each turn, they move one box through the facility, and when they
reached the exit they are fully trained. However, players can remove teams
early, but then they are only partially trained, and less effective. In Star Wars:
Rebellion, ship construction is managed this way too. But various special cards
can move ships down the track, accelerating production.
Strategic wargames use this production track mechanism, but have wanted,
for realism purposes, to have different durations to produce different units.
For example, an infantry unit might take a month, while an aircraft carrier
might take a year. Because of the number of units being built, moving tokens
from box to box is unwieldy, so designers created the Production Spiral. When
units are being built, the tokens are placed by following the spiral arm out
from the current month until the matching unit type is found. The tokens
are then placed in the section of the arm. When the Month marker is moved,
all tokens in that wedge become available to the player. World in Flames is a
good example.
Another way to implement this is to place purchased items into a discard
area, as is common in deck building games like Dominion. Here the delay
before the purchases are available is randomized, since the discards are
shuffled before creating the draw deck. This can create an issue with games
with a fixed number of turns, as items that are acquired late in the game
may never see play. This can be avoided by making late game purchases just
worth Victory Points, or by having a special shuffle towards the end of the
game. Core Worlds uses that latter technique, as the discards may be shuffled
in before the final turn, regardless of whether the draw deck is depleted or
not. While not guaranteeing that cards purchased at the end will be drawn,
it does increase the chances.

Income

Description
Players gain resources at defined times.

Discussion
To foster a sense of growth and forward progress, most games with economic
elements have some form of Income, where players receive additional
resources. This is a large topic, and several specific mechanisms discussed
in this chapter fall into this category. See “Automatic Resource Growth”
(ECO-06), “Loans” (ECO-07), “Exchanging” (ECO-01), “Market” (ECO03), and “Random Production” (ECO-12). However, there are some broad
generalizations that can be discussed.
First, the designer needs to consider the timing of when Income is received.
It can be scheduled, player-controlled, or random. Brass and Eclipse are
examples of games with scheduled Income phases. They come at a definite
point in the sequence of play, and players can plan around that.
Player-controlled systems rely on players to take actions that result in Income.
Typically it is self-controlled: a player makes a decision to take a Production
action that generates resources (as in Global Mogul), or sells something via a
Market (ECO-03). However, in some systems, part of a player’s Income may

Economics

253

rely on the actions of other players. For example, in Le Havre and Caylus, a
player gains Income if other players use their buildings (ECO-14).
This increases player interaction and rewards players that consider their
opponents’ positions. However, this is typically implemented as only a portion
of a player’s Income, and not a significant one.
There are games where all, or close to all, of a player’s Income is dependent
on other players. In Container, players produce and ship containers. But other
than taking loans, you may only gain money by enticing another player into
purchasing one of your containers. As can be expected, this makes these games
a lot less forgiving, and subject to social pressures. Container in particular has
this reputation.
Income can also be random. Roll and Move games like Monopoly
typically incorporate this. Players either rely on others landing on their
property spaces, or passing Go to collect money. But there are other more
sophisticated systems for randomly allocating resources. See Random
Production (ECO-12) for details.
Games can also be Open Economies or Closed Economies. In an Open
Economy, there is a bank that pumps more resources into the game system.
In contrast, in a Closed Economy, all the resources that exist are already in
player hands, and they just move between players during the course of the
game. The vast majority of games are Open Economies. This helps foster
a sense of progress and is easier for designers to balance. An example of
a Closed Economy game is Dream Factory, which is discussed in detail
in the (appropriately named) Closed Economy mechanism in Chapter 8,
“Auctions.”

Automatic Resource Growth

Description
Resources held by a player will automatically grow over time.

Discussion
In the purest form of this mechanism one or more resources increases by a set
amount (usually one) each turn. This allows the designer to gradually ramp
up player power in a simple and intuitive manner.
A popular example of this is in the digital card game Hearthstone. The
resource Mana is used to play cards. The Mana available at each turn begins
the game at one and is increased by one at each turn until it reaches a maximum
of 10. This gives the game an arc, as the options are much more restricted at
low Mana values, and complexity and combos are gradually introduced. It
also encourages players to balance their decks. If they only select cards with
high Mana values, they will not be able to play for several turns. But if they
only select low Mana cards, they may run out of cards quickly as they play
multiple cards per turn later in the game.
A variant on this system has unused resources grow. Thematically, this can
be expressed as bank interest or as breeding animals. Agricola uses the latter

Economics

255

option. If a player has two or more of the same type of animal, they gain an
additional one. This encourages efficiency and can force players into deciding
the value of using resources now, versus having more for later.

Loans

Description
Players may take a Loan from the bank to get more money.

Discussion
Many games with money allow players to borrow. These can serve several
purposes for the design. First, they can be punishments for players who
do not manage their money properly, and exist to keep those players in
the game. But they can also provide a means to victory, giving players
resources required to jump-start their engine, or complete a big project. In
fact, some games, like Railroad Tycoon: The Board Game, essentially require
taking Loans to be a part of a winning strategy. Designers need to be careful
to frame the concept of Loans in their game to incentivize players in the
appropriate way.
There are several varieties of Loan mechanisms in games, around the way
they are paid back, and other effects they have on the game. In some games,
Loans are never paid back during the game. They simply count against a
player’s final money totals or victory points.
In other games, such as Railways of the World, players pay interest each
turn based on bonds they have issued (another way of representing Loans).
Whenever a player wishes, they may take a bond certificate and $5,000. Each
turn they must pay $1,000 per bond, and bonds may never be repaid. Players
lose one victory point (VP) for each bond they have at the end of the game.

Economics

257

In Brass, players may use an action to take a loan of $30. This never has to be
repaid, but immediately reduces ongoing income.
Wealth of Nations adds a few wrinkles to this system. Each Loan gives cash
in declining increments ($20 for the first, $19 for the second, and so on), but
can be repaid for $25. Any Loans held at the end of the game reduce the score
by 3 VPs.
In Monopoly, players may take Loans but need to disable one of their
properties to do so. Flipping a property allows the player to take the mortgage
value from the bank. While it is flipped, the player may not collect rent if
someone lands on the property. To unmortgage a property, a player must pay
the mortgage value plus 10% interest. Other than the loss of the use of the
property, there is no penalty for having a property mortgaged through the
entire game. By rule, players must mortgage properties when faced with a cost
that they cannot pay. This mechanism takes choices away from players, while
needlessly extending a trailing player’s long, slow, death spiral. Designers
should avoid this type of mechanism.

Always Available Purchases

Description
Certain resources are Always Available to Purchase, while others may not or
may be limited in quantity.

Discussion
This mechanism has traditionally been used in Deck-Building games
(CAR-05). In Ascension: Deckbuilding Game, for example, there are two
basic actions for players: purchasing an available card or attacking a card.
In addition to a rotating queue of cards in the center, there are three cards
that are always available: Heavy Infantry and Mystics are always available
for purchase, and Cultists are always available to be attacked.
Having these cards gives a safety valve for players who face a board filled
with high-level cards that they cannot afford, or early in the game when their
hands may be weak. These cards are weaker than standard cards but are a
reasonable consolation prize in case players get stuck with a low-value draw
or allows them to use excess purchasing or attack power.
Dominion does not have random cards in the center, so the cost range
of the cards is more constrained, and there is almost always something
affordable. However, this mechanism is still used in the form of coin cards.
Having these standard cards helps players develop a sense of value and gives
them a target to know what they need to do to gain the highest scoring
Province cards.

I Cut, You Choose

Description
One player divides a set of resources into different groups. Other players have
first choice of which group to select.

Discussion
This I Cut, You Choose mechanism is based on a technique that parents often
use with two children who are, for example, dividing up a bar of candy. One
child breaks it into two pieces, and then the other selects which one they
want. This ensures that the one doing the dividing is incentivized to make it
as equitable as possible, because they know the other will take the larger piece.
In general, when this mechanism is used, it is between two players. For
example, in San Marco, players are paired up each turn, and one is designated
to divide drawn cards into two stacks. Then the other player selects which
stack they want to keep.
This mechanism forces players to consider a wide variety of factors, both
present and future, to put together offers that will entice the choosing player
to pick the desired stack while giving them as little as possible.

Economics

261

Some games, like New York Slice, extend this mechanism beyond two
players. In New York Slice, one player divides a stack of pizza ingredients into
several stacks equal to the player count. Then, going clockwise, each player
selects one stack, with the dividing player getting the last one remaining. In
this multiplayer variation, it is next to impossible for four or more divisions
to have even roughly equivalent value, so it is customary for each player to
have equal turns being the divider.
For this mechanism to be interesting, the value of each division can’t
be obvious. True value for each player must be hidden or obscured. The
most common way to do this is by integrating a variety of Set Collection
mechanisms, which is the go-to method for having the same thing be worth
different things to different players. See Chapter 12 for full details.

Discounts

Description
A player can obtain an asset at a reduced cost.

Discussion
In the typical implementation of this mechanism, players accumulate
Discounts that make future purchases less expensive, these Discounts
persist, and they stack (build on each other). These characteristics make this
mechanism well suited to create an engine-building effect, where players are
able to achieve more as the game continues.
In Splendor, for example, cards are obtained by cashing in gems (ECO-01).
Many of these cards Discount all future purchases by one or more gems. As the
game progresses, it becomes easier for players to obtain more expensive cards,
as they need fewer gems once they take the discounts into effect.
7 Wonders takes Discounts to an extreme by allowing players to acquire
a card at no cost if they have the prerequisite building. This is distinct from
an Upgrade mechanism (ECO-11), as the original card is retained. It is not
converted into the new building—it merely allows for its acquisition at no

Economics

263

cost. However, these Discounts are not fungible. They only apply to the single
building specified on the card.
One of the earliest examples of Discounting is Civilization. Technology
advances (called Civilization cards) gives players Discounts towards a specific
category of Civilization card, usually the same category as the card itself. For
example, Music, which costs 20 and is in the Art category, gives a 10 Discount
towards any future purchases in Art for the rest of the game. This encourages
players to specialize in certain areas. It also helps to create a Technology Tree
(ACT-16) without actually defining any prerequisites, by having the most
advanced cards be so expensive that they realistically can only be obtained
through Discounts.

Upgrades

Description
Assets may be Upgraded to improved versions.

Discussion
Upgrades share many characteristics with Discounts (ECO-10), but with
some distinctions. Typically, they are implemented by first representing the
action or ability with a card or tile, and then replacing it with a better version,
or adding another card or element to it to show its improved status.
Implementing Upgrades can nudge players to specialize, particularly if
it is much more expensive or even impossible to go directly to the upgraded
resource without the lower-level resource. As such, this can also be used to
implement a Tech Tree (ACT-16).
A specialized form of upgrade is seen in train games such as 1830 and
other 18xx games. Early in the game, players place yellow tiles, which have
simple single-track sections. Later, they may place more complex green or
brown tiles that include overpasses and junctions. However, when upgrading
a tile all existing track must be preserved. This limits the types of upgrade
tiles that can be used and creates competition and bottlenecks for certain
limited key tiles.
Some games force upgrades through obsolescence. At certain points, the
game advances to a new stage (ACT-15), and some items may become obsolete
and be discarded. The 18xx games use this mechanism by having trains go
obsolete, constantly forcing players to reevaluate their board position and
future growth.
The physicality of the upgrade is typically done by replacing a card or tile;
however, sometimes it is done by rotating or flipping. Maiden’s Quest and Flip
City make full use of this option by having players rotate or flip cards within
a deck to increase (or reduce) their strength. While this gives designers a lot

Economics

265

of flexibility in a small space, it places a burden on players to shuffle properly
and maintain orientation. Other means for upgrading include adding a new
card or card portion. Mystic Vale does this with clear plastic cards, each of
which is populated in its top, middle, or bottom third. Layering the cards
together enables all three sections to be seen at the same time. Cards are not
the only elements that can be upgraded, nor the only way to show upgrades.
In Monopoly, a property can be improved by adding houses, and eventually,
hotels, to it. In Catan, settlements can be upgraded to cities, each represented
by a different token.
Upgrades are a common mechanism outside of the specific economic lens
taken in this chapter. From promoting pawns in Chess to leveling up characters
in a dungeon crawl, to adding a fortification to a territory or hex, Upgrades
represent a means of investment that increase player power, contribute to
narrative, and help players create connections to elements in the game.

Random Production

Description
Resources are generated from a random process and distributed to qualifying
players.

Discussion
The Random Production mechanism was introduced in Crude but was
popularized in Catan. In both of these games, players begin their turn by
rolling two dice. In Catan, the die result determines which tiles activate,
and any players with settlements or cities touching that tile receive resources.
In Crude, the dice activate both the related row and column for the active
players, and either the related column or row for their neighbor.
This mechanism keeps all players involved on other players’ turns, by
offering the possibility of gaining resources. Players must remain flexible in
their planning, since they can’t guarantee resource production, or the specific
mix of resources they’ll get. There’s also a slot machine effect, as players may
hit a small “jackpot” if they hit a needed number.
This system was extended by Machi Koro by defining special abilities that
only trigger on a player’s turn, or that only trigger on other players’ turns.
This was further refined in Space Base, where each ability card has two
sides. The blue side has an ability that triggers on your turn. If the card is
replaced, it rotates to its red side, and now triggers when an opponent rolls

Economics

267

that number. Since, in games with more than two players, there are more
opponent turns than your turns, getting cards to their red side is an important
strategy.
A weakness of these systems is that they can be susceptible to player
perception of streaky dice rolls. In actuality, given the number of dice rolls
in a typical game of Catan, it is inevitable that some numbers will be rolled
more than average, which means that some will be rolled less. This introduces
a level of randomness that may or may not match the design intent, and player
expectation. Designers also need to realize that players are poor judges of
what is a normal “streak” in a game like this and will perceive their frequency
as worse than average even when they are exactly as expected. The Catan
Event Cards expansion introduces a deck of 36 cards featuring each of the
different possible outcomes of a roll of 2d6. A reshuffle card sits 5 cards from
the bottom, indicating when the deck is to be reshuffled. Whether this is an
improvement or not is largely in the eyes of the beholder, and the designer.

Investment

Description
Players own a share of an entity.

Discussion
Typically, this Investment mechanism represents ownership in the form
of stock. Players may buy shares of stock and accrue benefits based on the
amount of stock owned.
The benefits take two basic forms. In the simplest, players earn a dividend
based on the number of shares owned. This may occur periodically, or at
specific trigger points. Other systems give benefits to the player who owns
the most shares, or to the top shareholders. This is very similar to an Area
Majority system (ARC-02), so the considerations there apply.
Often it is a combination of these two. In Acquire, for example, players
buy shares in hotel chains, which grow during the game, and merge if they
touch. When a chain merges, each share pays a set amount, with the top two
shareholders earning special bonuses.
In Airlines, scoring happens at variable intervals based on Card Draw
(CAR-04). Each airline awards points based on the number of flight paths
it has claimed on the board. The player with the most gains 1 victory point
(VP) per flight path, and the player with the second-most gains half of that.

Economics

269

The parallels with Area Majority are clear, as having one more share than
your opponent is just as good as owning 100% of the shares. The number of
shares that are available is usually limited. In Airlines it varies by company,
so players can lock in a guaranteed majority by having, for example, 4 shares
in a 7-share company. This is distinct from the typical Area Majority game,
where players can put as many resources as they like into a single entity. This
distinctive mechanism is sometimes referred to as Area Control.
Another instructive example in Airlines is the way values change for different
airlines. Each has a different number of markers that can be placed on the
map to claim more routes. Airlines with more shares have more markers.
This makes them potentially more valuable, but players must do more to gain
and have the most shares. See Connections (VIC-14) and Network Building
(SET-04) for further discussion.
An analogous but different form of Investment is Contribution. Players
who contribute to a particular effort are entitled to a share of the spoils. For
example, in Tobago, players contribute clues to narrow down the location of
a treasure. When it is located, players who contributed clues to the correct
location earn a reward. In Dragon’s Gold, players cooperate to slay a dragon,
and players who participate (no matter to what degree) are entitled to

Ownership

Description
Players own entities, and perform actions for those entities, or collect benefits
if others use them.

Discussion
In Le Havre and Caylus, players may build buildings, which become new
action spaces that all workers can use (see “Worker Placement” in Chapter 9
for more details). Typically, the owner can use the space free-of-charge, but
when other players use the space, they must pay a fee to the owner.
This type of Ownership mechanism introduces a lot of different value
calculations for the player. If I invest in this building, is it attractive enough
that other players will use it and I will recoup my investment? If I take
advantage of a building owned by another player, will it benefit my opponent
more than me? As such, this mechanism can create a lot of player interaction.
In many rail games, including Empire Builder, Railway Rivals, and Rail
Baron, players may use tracks built by other players for a fixed cost. This leads
to decisions about how often a player may need to take a certain route in the
future and rent-vs.-buy calculations.
A more advanced form of Ownership is featured in 1830, 18xx games
more generally, Imperial, and more. In these games, players purchase shares
in companies (or countries in the case of Imperial), and the player with the
most shares is the executive owner and has the ability to take actions on
behalf of that entity. In 1830 players can build track and stations, buy trains,

Economics

271

and decide whether or not to issue dividends. In Imperial players may build
armies or navies, declare war on other countries, or build up their economy.
Typically, the money and assets of the company belong to the company.
Players have their own money and assets, and these are strictly separate. There
are specific means by which players can profit from running the company, not
all of which are to the benefit of the company or the other shareholders. Like
in real-world business, there are many strategies for enrichment, and these
games offer a high level of complexity and steeper learning curves.
If a player obtains more shares than the current owner, they take over
Ownership. This can lead to major shifts in board state. While owners usually
don’t like to lose their position, it can sometimes be an important tactic,
particularly in the 18xx series of games. In those, the corporations, which
represent railroad companies, must have trains. When trains become obsolete,
they are discarded, and new ones must be purchased. If the railroad does
not have enough money, the owner must pay for new trains out of pocket.
An important tactic is for the owner to drain money out of the company
treasury and then dump their shares to stick the almost-bankrupt company
with another player.
Greed Incorporated is also based around this idea, as the key strategy in
this game is getting Ownership of a company, getting it pay you bonuses, and
bailing out before it goes under.
Ownership of this type makes a game multilevel. Players need to consider
the individual player positions within companies, the companies’ positions
on the board, and the relative strengths and cash positions of all.

Contracts

Description
Players fulfill Contracts to earn rewards.

Discussion
Typically to complete a Contract, players turn in a specific combination of
goods and earn a reward, which is usually money or victory points (VPs).
Contracts can either be public or private. Public Contracts are face-up
and shared by all players who race to fulfill it first. Often the Contract is
discarded, but sometimes other players can fulfill the Contract later for a
lesser reward. Century: Spice Road is an example game with Public Contracts.
Private Contracts, by contrast, may only be fulfilled by the player that has
them. They may be known to all or kept hidden until fulfilled. In Empire
Builder, players have three Contract cards to deliver a specific good at a
specific city. These are face-up so all players can see them, but only the owner
may complete the delivery.
There are a variety of ways that players may obtain Contracts. They may be
obtained via random draw (as in Empire Builder or Century: Spice Road), by
selecting from a tableau, by drawing several and selecting which to keep and
which to discard, by draft, or even by auction (as in Mow Money).
Contracts give players immediate direction and goals, which can be
particularly important for new players. Public Contracts increase player
interaction, but also may lead to “feel-bad” moments if a player is really
close to completing a Contract but is scooped by an opponent at the last

Economics

273

second—particularly if 2nd place rewards aren’t available. In these cases, it is
helpful if whatever is used to fulfill the Contract is generally useful, so that
the effort to acquire that specific set of resources, or bring them to a specific
location, is not completely wasted.

Bribery

Description
Players offer bribes to other players to get them to perform specific actions.

Discussion
Bribery is a subset of the Trading mechanism (ECO-02); however, it is
typically more structured and given a different thematic basis. In a Bribery
mechanism, a player needs to make a decision, and the other players then
make monetary offers to entice the active player to make a particular choice.
Santiago uses this mechanism to great effect. Players are constructing
irrigation canals around fields. Each turn, one player is the overseer, and needs
to decide where they will be constructed. The other players may influence the
decision by laying a stick of their color in the direction they prefer, along with
some coins. If the overseer decides to build in a way that contains another
player’s bribe, they take it. However, they are free to build in a completely
different direction than any of the bribers would like. Bribes that are not
taken are returned to the players.
This system rewards players that are able to judge where the overseer may
want to build anyway, and also gives the overseer opportunity for bluff,
convincing the other players that the overseer wants to build in a different
direction than they truly do, to entice other players to place bribes where they
were planning to go anyway. The overseer also needs to value the benefit of a
particular build to their opponent, as opposed to the bribe that they would
receive.
While Bribery usually involves one active player and many potential bribers,
Tonga Bonga implements a multiplayer simultaneous bribe system. Players
have sailor tokens, but they cannot staff their own ships. Their sailors must be
sent to other players’ ships. At the start of each round, players place bribes on
different positions around those ships. Then, in sequence, each player places

Economics

275

a sailor on an available space, potentially gaining the bribe there. Sailors have
different ratings, and a higher-rated sailor can kick out a lower-rated sailor
from a position—a kind of Auction or Area Majority mechanism (ARC-02).
After all sailors have been placed, players gain coins on their spaces.
Players need to balance gaining coins, versus sending their best sailors
to help their opponents move their ship, which ultimately is the way to win
the game. Money is only a means towards an end and does not yield direct
victory points.
Sheriff of Nottingham uses Bribery as a one-on-one mechanism. Players are
trying to bring goods into the city and need to declare what they are bringing
in to the Sheriff, who is played by a different player each round. Players place
the cards they wish to get into the city in a sealed pouch, and must declare
the contents to the Sheriff, truthfully or not. The Sheriff has to decide whether
to inspect the bag or not. If the player was lying, the Sheriff gains, if not, the
player gains. Before the Sheriff decides to inspect or not, the player may offer
a bribe for them to not inspect, which can lead to interesting negotiations
and Yomi (UNC-01).

Increase Value of Unchosen Resources

Description
If players do not select certain Actions or Resources, then they increase in
value.

Discussion
Puerto Rico is one of the earliest examples of this mechanism. Each player
selects one role during a round, but there are more available roles than players.
The roles that are not chosen gain a coin at the end of each round. In the
future, when a players select that role they also gain the coins on it. This
mechanism is a specific type of Dutch Auction (AUC-08).
Small World and Century: Spice Road also implement this system in a
different guise. When a players select a new faction in Small World, they
select it from a queue. They may take any available faction in the queue but
must place a coin on each one that they skip over.
In Agricola, a worker placement game (Chapter 9), some spaces are stocked
with an addition resource each turn. If those spaces are not selected, they will

Economics

277

accumulate more and more resources, until a player claims them and takes all
the resources on the space.
These systems all have in common that they allow the players to value
the choices. The value of unselected options gradually increases, until the
value reaches a point that entices a player to choose it. While this doesn’t
eliminate the need for the designer to balance options, it gives some flexibility
to price options that have values that may change over the course of the game
or are random combinations that vary in power (as in Small World).

Negotiation

Description
Players make agreements about courses of action.

Discussion
Negotiation as a mechanism is very similar to Trading (ECO-02). We are
drawing a distinction here between the exchange of resources, which defines
Trading, and the influencing of actions that people take, usually in exchange
for a promised action by the negotiating player. Bribery (ECO-16) combines
these, exchanging resources for an action. The dividing line here is certainly
fuzzy, but useful.
Negotiation games often include deals that are non-binding. Diplomacy is a
classic example. Players can discuss and coordinate moves, but nothing in the
game binds players to follow through when they secretly write their orders.
Designers may include rules that mandate binding Negotiations. Typically,
these require that the terms of the deal be resolved immediately, and not

Economics

279

extend to future turns or actions. This is a practical matter, as it becomes
difficult to remember what the negotiated deal terms were and eliminates the
need to include rules for what happens of the agreed-upon action physically
cannot be performed.
Non-binding deals raise the emotional stakes for many players, because
they raise questions of honesty and loyalty, which are social rather than
economic norms. Negotiations can also dramatically lengthen games, and so
negotiation periods may need to be time-limited.
While any game is potentially subject to players negotiating, there are a
few techniques for designers to add it as a specific feature. One is to have
a dedicated Negotiation or discussion phase, as is done in Diplomacy or
The Resistance. The rules should contain some structure around length of
Negotiations and what is or is not binding.
Negotiation can also be encouraged through Voting (RES-15), Hidden
Roles (UNC-04) and Simultaneous Action Selection (TRN-09). These
mechanisms introduce discussion and negotiation naturally, although it
is recommended that the legality of negotiation (and again, the scope), be
referenced in the rules.
Finally, negotiation can be supported thematically. Games that are
modeling deals, or politics (like I’m the Boss or Republic of Rome) will naturally
lead to player negotiation.

Alliances

Description
Players have formal relationships that may change over the course of the
game.

Discussion
In pure Negotiation games (ECO-18), agreements to cooperate are informal
and can be made or broken at will. This mechanism differs in that there is
a formal step to enter into and leave an Alliance, and the game rules specify
how the Alliance operates.
For example, in Dune, each turn, cards are revealed from the Spice deck.
If one of them is a Worm card, the players are allowed to make and break
alliances. These alliances are in force until the next Worm card is revealed.
Players that are allied may not attack each other, combine their score for
winning purposes, win together, and may cooperate in other ways. When
the next Worm is revealed, players may decide if they want to continue the
alliance, ally with another player, or go it alone. Empires in Arms, a detailed
simulation of the Napoleonic Wars, has a robust and complex alliance system,
with a variety of possible formal relationships between players.

Economics

281

In Struggle of Empires, each Round begins with players bidding for the right
to divide the players into two teams of their choosing. Like Dune, players who
are allied fight together and may not attack each other. However, players still
win or lose individually, which creates interesting dynamics.
Cosmic Encounter has players trying to conquer planets from their
opponents. Each time this occurs, there is a formal alliance step, where players
may choose to ally with the attacker, defender, or stay out of it, and there are
defined benefits and penalties if their side wins or loses. So this is a similar
system, although it is much shorter in duration, lasting one turn.
There are a variety of other takes on this system. Through the Ages has Treaty
cards that players can offer to their opponents to gain mutual (sometimes
asymmetrical) benefits. The Trick-Taking card game (CAR-01) Mu has
partners assigned for the hand based on a bidding phase. Hidden Role games
(UNC-04) secretly put players on different teams.

Auctions

ӶӶ
A common concern in game design is how to allocate resources fairly among
players. One of the most versatile solutions is an auction. Auctions provide for
player agency, drama, interaction, strategy and calculation. They are engaging
and skill-testing, while providing players the opportunity to acquire whatever
they wish, as long as they are able to pay.
The branch of mathematics called Game Theory studies auctions
extensively, and game designers can draw on a rich trove of auction types with
widely varying dynamics. Auctions can help keep a game in balance because
players can dynamically adjust their pricing in response to fluctuations in the
value of goods in a game.
For a time, auction mechanisms were wildly popular, and Reiner Knizia,
the master of the auction, dominated the tabletop industry and the awards
circuit with a dizzying array of clever and innovative auction games. Other
genres, like 18xx, also incorporated auctions, especially on setup. Yet, over
time, the auction has waned in popularity, as Worker Placement (Chapter 9)
and Drafting Mechanisms (CAR-06) presented alternative methods for
allocating actions and resources in games.
Why did this shift occur? To some extent, gamer tastes change, like
fashion, but designers should be aware of some of the drawbacks of the auction
mechanism that contributed to its decline. Auctions depend on players being
able to make accurate valuations of the lots up for auction. As players gain
experience with a game, these assessments are easier to make, but for many
players, the first few plays can be very frustrating. Auctions are also fragile to
players who make bidding mistakes, like over-spending early. In many auction
games, one bad judgment can cripple a player for the rest of the game.

283

284

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

A challenging counterpoint to players being able to accurately judge value
is that they should not be able to judge it too accurately. As an example,
consider how much you would bid for a $10 bill. Any bid other than $10
doesn’t make sense: bid more and you’ll over-pay. Bid less, and you’ll be outbid. There needs to be some obscuring of the precise value of the lot up for
bid. Some ways to do that include hidden goals, having the values depend on
what lots may be available in the future, or a mechanism like set collection
(Chapter 12) which makes the same good have different values to different
players.
Auctions can also slow a game down quite a bit. While this isn’t a problem
when auctions are the central mechanism of the game, it can present problems
for pacing and play-time when they’re a sub-system in a bigger game.
Fortunately, there are many auction mechanics that are specifically designed
to address this challenge, and we discuss them in this chapter. Multiple-lot
auctions, simultaneous, or single-bid auctions, and auctions with substantial
constraints on bidding amounts all help make auctions work better in the
context of tabletop games.
As you read this section, you may find that many other mechanisms can be
described as a kind of auction or are isomorphic to an auction. We’ll point to
examples throughout this section that may be surprising or eye-opening. Keep
in mind, however, that the math underlying an auction, or any mechanism,
is only one piece of the puzzle. How players experience a mechanism, how it’s
presented, and the way it supports the game’s theme and setting are as much a
part of the mechanism as the underlying math. Nonetheless, auctions are like
the skeletal system of games. In many cases, it is their mathematical dynamics
and structure that support the rest of the structure.

Open Auction

Description
Players shout out bids as they will, with no turn order. While an Open
Auction will typically end when a certain amount of time with no increases
occurs, or it is clear that no one wishes to raise the current bid, a true Open
Auction allows a seller to accept any bid at any time and close the Auction.
Though the usual outcome is that the high bidder is the winner, no rule
requires this outcome.

Discussion
An Open Auction is quite unusual in that it has no auctioneer, and no rules—
not even the rule that the highest price must win. In a sense, an Open Auction
is more like an out-loud simultaneous negotiation. The reality is that very few
auctions, in the real world or in board games, are truly open. That’s because
Open Auctions are pretty messy! Multiple bidders often want to bid the same
amount, and the bidding increments can be all over the place. Some bidders
may not hear all the bids, and confusion is all too common. Without an
auctioneer, these auctions can be difficult to govern fairly. In the boardgame
context, it’s worth pointing out that they also tend to be really noisy and

286

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

frenetic. The only game we could find that uses Open Auctions is Monopoly.
In perhaps the most-overlooked rule in the game, when a player decides not to
buy a property from the bank, the property is sold at an Open Auction to any
player (including the one who chose not to buy it from the bank initially) at
any price. Given this example, designers should carefully consider whether an
Open Auction truly suits their game, or whether a different auction structure
might work better.
Despite their weaknesses, Open Auctions do have some important features.
First, iterative bidding provides a lot of information as players reveal their
preferences and for the goods up for auction. The auction integrates a means
for allocating resources with a way for players to trade opinions about how
valuable they are.
Another important feature of the Open Auction is that the dominant strategy
for any bidder is to stay in the auction until their value for the auctioned goods
is reached. This means that, absent external issues like very large disparities
in player wealth, the winner will pay a price close to the actual value for the
item—or, to be precise, they will pay one dollar (or other bidding increment)
more than the price at which the 2nd-highest bidder valued the item.
In general, Open Auctions are more theoretical than practical. There are
many small tweaks to the basic structure that create much more suitable
dynamics for use in tabletop games. We include the mechanism of Open
Auctions here to act as a basis for comparison.

English Auction

Description
An auctioneer asks for bids of a certain amount and players indicate their
willingness to bid at that amount, usually by holding up a hand or paddle, or
by calling out. Players are permitted to adjust the increment of the bid, usually
by shouting out their actual bid, though this is done infrequently, and usually
either to indicate a smaller increment than the auctioneer requests, or a much
larger one. When a certain amount of time with no increases occurs, or it is
clear that no one wishes to raise the current bid, the auctioneer declares that
the high bidder is the winner.

Discussion
The English Auction is probably what most people think of when they hear
the word “auction.” The auctioneer, at the front of the room, speaking in a
too-fast-to-follow cadence while various bidders use paddles to signal their
intent to bid in ever-increasing amounts until, at last, the “going, going,
gone!” is sounded and the winning bid is declared.
The primary differences between an English and an Open Auction are in
their governance. An English Auction employs an auctioneer to recognize
bidders, to determine which bids are valid, who the current winning bid

288

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

is, and what is the appropriate bid increment to maximize the settlement
price of the auction, while also bringing the auction to a swift conclusion.
The compensation of auctioneers in the real world suggests that these skills
are non-trivial, and that better auctioneers execute better auctions, which
produce higher prices for sellers.
For designers, the need for an auctioneer can make English Auctions
less appealing, even though the benefits they provide in terms of certainty,
fairness, and speed are substantial. Fortunately, designers can turn to a variety
of similar auctions that capture those benefits without requiring mediation—
including auctions in which the auctioneer may bid. We’ll look at those in
the next sections.
An overlooked feature of English Auctions is that the price of the auction
moves against the preferences of the bidders—that is, it goes up. While that’s
what most of us think of when we think of auctions, there are auctions in
which the price moves the other way, starting at some high number and them
moving down. See Dutch Auction (AUC-08) as an example.
English Auctions are dynamic and dramatic, but they share the core of the
open auction in that they reveal a lot of information to the bidders about one
another, and they have a weakly dominant strategy of simply staying in the
bidding until your value is reached.
There are some other strategies that bidders employ though, whose effects
are primarily psychological. Players might make a large jump in bid increment
to intimidate other bidders, or they might leave their paddle in the air (aka
“Lighthouse bidding”) to show they’re in for the long haul. Bidding quickly
and crisply is another way to demonstrate an intention to stay in the bidding
for a while. These strategies may have the desired effect of driving other players
off, but they can also inadvertently raise prices beyond what was necessary to
win the auction. Finally, a player may make a bid that is larger than her own
value for the lot in order to inflate the final settlement price of the auction.
This move can backfire, however, if no other bidder raises the bid further.
An important aspect of English Auctions, and auctions with auctioneers
more generally, is to whom the closing price is paid. In some auctions, rather
than paying the bank, the player who chooses the item up for bid receives
payment, unless they are the winner of the item, in which case payment is
made to the bank. In practice, the result of this mechanism, which is featured
in Modern Art, is that the auctioneer player, the one who put the item up for
bid, very rarely purchases it, because effectively, they pay double: the cost of
the item, and the forgone gains from letting someone else win it and collecting

Auctions

289

the payment. Thus, effectively, the player who puts the item up for bid plays as
the auctioneer, rather than an active bidder, for the duration of that auction.
The dynamic and engaging nature of English Auctions is exciting, but
designers will typically have to turn to another mechanism for implementation
at the table.

Turn Order Until Pass Auction

Description
Starting with one player and going in turn order, players may raise the current
bid or pass. When all players but one have passed, the player remaining in the
auction is the winner.
Normally players that pass may not re-enter the auction. However, allowing
re-entry is a variation that is not uncommon.

Discussion
The benefits of this Turn Order Until Pass mechanism are in its simplicity
and how it aligns with players’ expectations. Players are rarely confused by
how to run this kind of auction, so it doesn’t require an auctioneer. Popular
games, like Power Grid and Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization,

Auctions

291

feature this type of auction, and in a boardgame-adjacent space, auctions in
fantasy sports are typically of this kind, perhaps adding to the popularity and
familiarity of the mechanism.
From a game theory perspective, the dominant strategy for bidders is the
same as in an Open Auction: namely, to stay in the bidding until their value
for the item for bid is reached. This can help prevent any player from receiving
an unearned windfall simply because of the mechanics of the bidding.
Turn Order Until Pass provides a structure to govern the uncertainties that
normally exist in Open and English Auctions. A player may only bid on his
or her turn and must exceed the previous high bid. This ordered and clear
structure make it an excellent choice for board games.
Turn Order Until Pass does have some drawbacks. For one, it’s not as
dynamic as Open Auctions, as the ordered process of bidding removes some
of the energy from the auction process.
The imposition of a turn order on bidding also creates a bit of unfairness.
If the current bid is $10, and it’s not my turn, I can’t bid $11. If $11 is the
most I’m willing to pay, but the active player goes ahead and bids $11, there’s
nothing I can do. If nobody else bids, that player will win the auction at
$11 even though more than one bidder was willing to pay that amount.
In an English Auction, a skilled auctioneer will recognize when more than
one bidder is stuck on the same bid, and will cajole one or the other to raise
their bid. Failing that, the auctioneer will recognize the bid of whomever bid
first—which may not be perfectly fair either, but at least provides all bidders
with the theoretical opportunity to bid any number they wish. In a Turn
Order Until Pass Auction, by contrast, some players will simply not have the
opportunity to bid certain values.
Another issue introduced when there is no auctioneer is that an auction
can drag if players don’t increment their bids reasonably. In games where
players hold a lot of money, players incrementing their bids $1 at a time can be
painful. However, incrementing by $1 at a time is theoretically the dominant
strategy to avoid over-paying, so it’s tough to put the blame on the players for
doing so. It’s the designer’s responsibility to incentivize behavior that leads to
a better experience!
Turn Order Until Pass remains one of the easiest types of auctions to
implement, to run, and to participate in. The mechanism exists in many
different games as a relatively quick way to allocate resources or benefits.
However, games that place a central focus on the auction mechanism usually
introduce some additional twist. In recent years, Drafting (CAR-06) has
overtaken simple bidding as the preferred method for quick allocation of

292

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

resources—not least because auctions require more precise valuation by
players, which can be challenging, especially for new players. This issue is
not unique to this specific kind of auction and has been discussed at greater
length in the introduction to this section.
Re-entry after passing is a variant that allows players to pass but re-enter
the bidding when their turn comes around again. Passing is risky, in the sense
that if all but one player passes, the auction will close. However, re-entering
after passing does create some interesting drama, but at a high cost in terms
of play-time. When players pass, an auction speeds along since it has fewer
participants. When re-entry is allowed, the number of participants in the
auction never decreases. Perhaps the main advantage of allowing re-entry is
preventing accidental windfalls, by allowing a previously passed player to raise
the bid on a lot that should sell for more, but whose value is languishing for
whatever reason.

Sealed-Bid Auction

Description
Players secretly make a bid. All bids are revealed simultaneously, and the high
bidder wins.

Discussion
Sealed-Bid Auctions, also called Blind-Bid Auctions, compress all the
excitement of an auction into one tense bidding decision, followed by a big
reveal. Designers favor them for these features, as well as for their speed. In
games in which an auction is one sub-system in a larger game, or in which
there are many sequential auctions, a single sealed-bid system is perfect
for moving the game along. A good example of this is the Game of Thrones
board game, in which players run a gauntlet of three auctions in a row
every few turns. The consecutive auctions allocate special abilities among
the players, and thus must be quick and decisive, as the rest of the game
involves intricate and time-consuming planning, negotiations, and troop
movements.
Sealed-Bid Auctions sacrifice some of the informational value of other
iterative bid systems. Players who assess correctly that they will not be the

winners of an auction will often bid nothing, or perhaps a token amount, so as
to deny other players knowledge of their true valuation. This may be a feature
or a bug, depending on the intent of the designer and the needs of the design,
but is worth keeping in mind when employing this mechanism.
Sealed-bid systems typically require some type of tie-breaker, since
nothing stops players from bidding the same amount. Various tie-breaking
methods exist. In the aforementioned A Game of Thrones, one of the abilities
that players bid on is the ability to break ties—an ability that starts the game
with one of the players. Other common tie-breakers include turn order or
reverse order of current score (a kind of catch-up mechanism). Some games
feature rebidding by the tied players, like Spartacus: A Game of Blood and
Treachery, and Container. Fist of Dragonstones breaks ties through a rebid
with a special currency that is only used for that purpose. This approach is
decisive, but it lengthens the bidding process that sealed bidding is meant
to curtail.
An ergonomic consideration for sealed bidding is the componentry used
for currency. The easiest way to do sealed bidding is by placing currency in
a closed fist. Designers should carefully consider the size and material for
the currency to ensure that bids fit comfortably in most hands, that tokens
are easy to stack and pick up, and that they are at least somewhat resistant
to the palm-sweat these auctions engender. Other approaches to sealed bids
include using a dial to set a value, as in Dune, setting a die to a value, as in
Tiny Epic Kingdoms, or placing bids behind a screen, as in Modern Art.
Sealed-Bid Auctions are often used for combat resolution. In both Dune
and Tiny Epic Kingdoms, players bid military strength, which might be further
modified by other effects, to determine the victor of a military encounter.
Scythe offers a similar auction, but players bid a resource to power their mechs
rather than bidding actual troops.
Sealed bidding, more than any other type of bidding, may require losers
to pay their bids (sometimes referred to as an “all-pay” auction). This has
stronger thematic consonance when the bids represent a battle, rather than
the purchase of goods. The lost bids make sense when they represent battle
losses, but they make less sense when the bids are surrendered but no goods
are acquired in return. All-pay auctions are used in game theory to model,
among other things, elections and political contests, which perhaps makes
them more fitting for use in the Game of Thrones board game. There is a lot
of design space available in all-pay auctions, though players often express
strongly negative reactions to these auctions, so proceed with care. Note that
variants like loser-pays-half, as in For Sale (which is a turn-order auction, not

Auctions

a blind bid), can help remove some of the sting, while incentivizing higher
bids, ironically.

Sealed Bid with Cancellation

Description
Players secretly make a bid. All bids are revealed simultaneously, and the high
bidder wins, unless there are ties for high bidder. Tied bids cancel each other
out and are treated as the lowest bids.

Discussion
The purpose of ties cancelling out is in some sense a response to the challenge
of running auctions without an auctioneer. A skilled auctioneer can help sort
out two tied bidders and create some separation between them. Cancellation
acts as a kind of heavy-handed auctioneer who refuses to acknowledge tied
bids.
Mechanically, this type of auction works best when coupled with
constrained bids that increase the chances of ties. When players are working
from a defined and limited set of bid markers, they may have a much better
idea about what their opponents could bid. The bidding game begins to
resemble a bluffing or betting game more than a regular auction, as players
know that bidding big can’t guarantee their victory. If players are good at
tracking which markers players have already used to bid, they can deduce

Auctions

297

which low bids might actually win the auction, and which high bids are more
susceptible to cancellation. This interaction does echo real-world dynamics
in which the two strongest competitors can impede each other sufficiently to
allow a weaker competitor to emerge from the fray with the prize.
This counter-intuitive mechanism hasn’t proven especially popular over the
years. The non-thematic notion that a seller would ignore a higher bid simply
because more than one bidder made it flies in the face of economic rationalism.
As such, this is a mechanism that can feel “gamey,” or anti-thematic.
Another drawback to this mechanism is that bidders can find it quite
punishing while also feeling random. When players reveal their bids and
discover they both valued the lot really highly, but neither gets it, that can
be very frustrating.
However, this same feature can lead to fun and dramatic moments, and
increases the element of Yomi (UNC-01) for the players. As such, it works
best in lighter games with more chaos. Players looking for a highly strategic
experience will not be attracted to this mechanism.

Constrained Bidding

Description
This is a meta-mechanism that can modify other auction techniques. Players
may not bid any number that they wish. They may only bid based on
increments and/or combinations of certain resources.

Discussion
The greatest drawback of auctions as a game design mechanism is their
length. The second-biggest defect is that it is difficult for players to make
small distinctions in the value of the lots up for bid. Is some collection of
goods worth 13? 14? 15? At small increments, it can be very challenging to
make a determination.
Constrained Bidding offers a cure to both of these defects. Since there are
fewer valid bids, and the increment required to raise the bid is higher, auctions
come to a close more quickly. Players are rarely faced with the decision to
increase their bid by one or two units, and those larger increments make it
easier for players to value the lots up for bid.
One of the effects of Constrained Bidding is a reduction in the uncertainty
of auction outcomes. It’s easier for players to predict which other players
might be interested in a lot, and how they’ll bid. Some games will have

Auctions

299

bidding tokens be hidden information to retain some of the tension in
the auction.
Constrained Bidding is a favorite for designer Reiner Knizia, appearing in
designs of his, including Ra, Amun-Re and High Society. Yet it hasn’t caught
on as a generally popular auction mechanism, and designers should be aware
of some substantial drawbacks to it.
For one, Constrained Bidding, aside from the basic constraint of some
minimum bid increment, is an especially artificial device. The need to raise a
bid by a specific amount or based on the limitation of which bidding tokens
you hold doesn’t typically have any thematic justification. It’s hard to imagine
a real-world auction that would use this kind of mechanism.
Constrained Bidding also introduces a challenge in redistributing the
used bidding tokens. In most auction games, the money system is either
fixed, or based on some economy that enables you to buy and sell the goods
up for auction. But in a fixed token system, all the advantages those fixed
increments grant to speed of auction come at the cost of their non-liquidity.
Put simply, you can’t make change! Designers need to carefully consider both
the balance of initial apportionment of bid tokens and how they come back
to their owners after use.
One area in which there is still considerable design space is multiuse
bidding counters. Will you use a powerful card as currency to bid in an
auction? Or will you save its power for use in another aspect of the game?
One might see Twilight Struggle (and many other area majority games) as a
series of simultaneous auctions, with the multiuse cards representing a kind
of fixed bid. Admittedly, in Twilight Struggle, the cards, when used as action
points, are more liquid than a true Constrained Bid Auction, but it’s in the
same family.
Indeed, there is an entire category of games that are based on bidding
cards with multiple uses, often with players having duplicate decks. Libertalia
and Eggs & Empire come to mind immediately. The cards can be seen as a
kind of Constrained Bidding token, and players typically have to use each
card once before being allowed to pick up the discards. What distinguishes
these games from true auctions is twofold. First, the games don’t always have
an actual lot up for bid. The revealed cards may interact with a pot of gold,
for example, but they don’t represent contingent offers to purchase some lot
as in most auctions. Second, even when a lot or lots do exist, like in Eggs &
Empire, winning the auction doesn’t necessarily lead to winning the lot. More
generically, the player with the highest bid doesn’t necessarily win the auction.
Typically, in these games, in addition to the currency value on the card, there

300

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

are some additional effects and interactions that can impact the auction’s
outcomes dramatically. Nevertheless, these games merit a mention here as
they are a means of using the Constrained Bid structure in an engaging and
more thematically resonant way.

Once-Around Auction

Description
The players each have one opportunity to bid, either passing or raising the prior
bidder. The order of bids is determined by one of the Turn Order structures.
After the last player has their opportunity to bid, the high bidder wins.

Discussion
The Once-Around Auction structure takes a straightforward approach to
shortening auctions by simply collapsing the whole auction into one round.
This works very well for speeding the auction, but it does have disparate
impacts on players depending on their position in the turn order. The first
player is faced with the substantial challenge of making a bid without any
other information. Their bid will set the market and is vulnerable to being
outbid by any player, who can bid as little as one dollar more. By contrast,
the last player in turn order has perfect information. They know exactly how
much to bid to win the lot. Often, the player in the next-to-last place is faced
with a lot that is relatively inexpensive, but which they don’t actually want.
However, they feel like they must police the auction and raise the bid to
prevent the last player from getting a windfall.
Whether the strong left-right binding (the term used to describe games
that are strongly impacted by turn order, and specifically, the players seated to
the right and left of a given player) of this mechanism is positive or negative
is largely a matter of perspective, but it is something to design around. For
example, turn order can itself be priced in such a manner that the advantage
provided by going last in the auction is accounted for. Alternatively, going

302

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

first in other aspects of the game may be quite powerful, to help balance the
disadvantage of going first in the auction.
Another approach is to use constrained bids that require bidders to raise
the current winning bid by a more substantial increment, or to provide the
first bidder with the right to match the final bid and take the lot.
Once-Around Auctions aren’t that common in modern designs, having
been superseded by Sealed-Bid Auction (AUC-04) that are agnostic to turn
order, or by drafting mechanisms that eliminate the role of currency entirely.
Generally, they should be used when tight coupling to turn order is desirable
and turn order is central to the design.

Dutch Auction

Description
A simultaneous single-bid system in which the lot starts at a very high price, and
then is gradually decreased by the auctioneer or other controlling mechanism,
until someone agrees to claim the item at its current price, ending the auction.
The first bidder to accept the current price is the winner, such that there are
no ties. A Dutch Auction is sometimes also called a one-bid auction because of
this feature that the first bid made is also the only bid in the auction.

Discussion
The Dutch Auction has a storied history, having been invented in the
seventeenth century in Holland to manage the sale and trade of tulip bulbs
that arrived in Holland via the Ottoman Empire. A Dutch Auction maximizes
the price at which a good is sold, and incentivizes buyers to act quickly, since
once a bid is made there is no opportunity to counter the bid; the auction
is over!
Dutch Auctions only work well when there is a single item up for bid, or
a single lot. All bidders must receive information of the offer price dropping
simultaneously and must be able to respond immediately. Any bidder with an
informational time lag is highly disadvantaged in this kind of auction, whether
that time lag is on hearing the newly announced price, or in submitting a bid.

304

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

One way to execute a Dutch Auction is with an actual clock that counts
down prices, as in Merchants of Amsterdam, but the componentry alone makes
this an unusual approach.

Dutch Auctions spread over multiple turns are very common in board
games and are often implemented as a row or river of cards. Each position in
the row is tied to a price and players may purchase a card from any position.
When a card is purchased, more expensive cards slide down and become
cheaper. In many games, the last card is free, and in others, the cheapest card
will disappear from the market every turn, and a new card will enter at the
pricey side. Examples of this market row include Suburbia, Phil Eklund’s
Pax series, and Through the Ages. A common variant can be seen in Small
World, in which players can purchase the first card in the row for free or pay
1 coin per card they want to bypass until they reach the card they wish to
purchase. The trick here is that a player acquires any coins on a card they
purchase, which means it’s not necessary to have a card-clearing mechanism
in the market. Eventually, the first option will be worth taking for the coins
piled on it.
This implementation isn’t strictly a traditional Dutch Auction, since
more than one good is up for auction at the same time. It’s also typically
mediated by turn order: you can only make a purchase on your turn.
Because of different mechanisms for adjusting the market each turn, every
player does not have an equal opportunity to pay any price they wish for a
given good. In some cases, like Through the Ages, calculating at what cost

Auctions

305

a card will be available to you, or manipulating that by purchasing cards
that are cheaper and forcing cards to slide down multiple positions is a key
strategy.
Despite some of these issues, the market row has become a staple of game
design and a favorite method for reasonably fair resource allocation. The
logic of this mechanism can sometimes find its way into worker placement
games. For example, in Agricola, some buildings will accumulate resources
if nobody places a worker there. Eventually, the rewards available are so
rich that someone claims them. Through the lens of the Dutch Auction,
we’d say that the price per share kept going down until a buyer was willing
to purchase the whole lot. This isn’t quite a Dutch Auction, it’s really an
auction with a fixed price (one worker, though it could be a monetary price
in a different context), but in which the rewards increase. However, note
that unlike traditional auctions, this auction shares a primary feature with
Dutch Auctions, which is that the value moves in favor of the buyer. Dutch
Auctions use price to effectuate this, rather than size of return, but they are
conceptually quite similar.
Dutch Auctions as implemented through market rows are quite a robust
and durable solution for game designers. They typically don’t take up too
much board space, they’re ergonomic, decisive, quick, and make for interesting
decisions. In some games, like Morels, or Majesty: For The Realm, they can
be a bit tedious when it comes to constantly sliding down cards. Vikings uses
an ingenious wheel mechanism to address this situation elegantly, by placing
the prices on the wheel and rotating it to adjust the prices of the tiles laid
around its perimeter.
Designers will frequently turn to this river-of-lots mechanism when using
some non-monetary currency for resource acquisition. The aforementioned
Through the Ages uses an Action Point currency (ACT-01) for card acquisition.
Though Small World themes the cost as monetary, money is worth an equal
number of victory points, so the actual cost to acquire a lot is victory points.
This mechanism is also quite amenable to variations involving allowing players
to reserve a card in the market for purchase later at a lower price, or claiming
a card so that its eventual acquisition cost is paid directly to the player.

Second-Bid Auction

Description
This mechanism modifies other auctions, such as Turn Order Until Pass, or
Sealed Bid. The amount paid by the Highest Bidder is equal to the second
highest bid.

Discussion
In game theory, Second-Bid auctions, also called Second-Price auctions, or
Vickrey auctions, are well studied in relation to the question of how will the
choice of auction type impact the price of a good? If I have a car that I want to
sell, for example, which auction type will fetch me the best price? One way to
ensure the highest possible price for the seller is to use an auction mechanism
that encourages bidders to make mistakes in their bidding strategies. A Dutch
Auction (AUC-08) is a great example. The added pressure of the clock, and
the possibility of someone else making a bid that can’t be countered leads to
somewhat higher settlement prices than a traditional English Auction.
In many cases, there is a desire to create a fast and fair auction, in which the
best strategy for all bidders is to simply bid the highest price they are willing

308

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

to pay. In a traditional auction, the correct strategy is to bid $1 more than the
previous bid until your reserve point is met. You don’t increase your bid by
more than $1 over the previous bid because maybe nobody will outbid you
and you’ll win the auction at a lower price than the amount you were willing
to pay. This makes for slow going at times.
A second-highest auction is the solution to the question of how to make
auctions fast and fair for buyers and sellers. In essence, your bid in a SecondPrice auction is not an offer to pay that amount, but to pay anything up to
that amount. Your bid of $1,000 is really a bid of $999, such that anyone who
wants to buy the item must pay $1,000 or more. The dominant strategy in a
Second-Price auction is to bid your true value for the lot. If all other players
value the lot at a lower price, you’ll pay their valuation, not your higher price.
If other players value the lot higher than you, you won’t win, but they’ll never
pay less than your true value.
Vickrey Auctions are extremely rare in board games. The only example
we were able to turn up was Reiner Knizia’s Das letzte Paradies (The Last
Paradise), a largely forgotten title. In part this is because Vickrey Auctions
aren’t that different from other auction types when it comes to board games.
In any non-blind auction method, a Vickrey settlement method will yield a
final price that is roughly the same as the non-Vickrey, or perhaps one bid
increment smaller. That’s a lot of rules overhead for such a small change
in price. In blind bidding systems, the Vickrey does impact actual prices
more substantially, but in many cases, the game design capitalizes on that
inefficiency in the auction. Put another way, the returns to bidding skill are
higher in Non-Vickrey Auctions, whereas Vickrey Auctions provide a clear
dominant strategy to the bidders. In a sense, the efficiency of Vickrey Auctions
may make them less interesting for gameplay.
Perhaps another important reason Vickrey Auctions aren’t used is because
their game-theoretical impact isn’t patently obvious to players. If you explain
the way the auction works, most players don’t intuitively understand that
their best bet is to bid their true value. A game that uses Vickrey to try and
make auctions more fair and less chaotic may find that players are simply
confused by it.
Where Vickrey Auctions really shine is in a situation that doesn’t come
up in board games very often, which is in allocating a large lot of identical
goods. Want to sell 100 tons of cinnamon? A Vickrey Auction is a great way
to find the settlement price at which all 100 tons will sell. Once that price is
found, even bidders who offered more for some portion of the lot will only
be charged the lowest price that clears the whole lot. In essence, the buyer is

Auctions

309

trading away the highest possible returns for speed and certainty in the sales
process. An echo of this idea can be found in Harbour, where a player must
sell their entire lot of goods when they choose the sell action, but this sale
is to the bank. One might imagine that this transaction is the end result of
a Vickrey Auction that happened off-sceen, so to speak. Vickrey Auctions,
though important for study and for understanding auction strategies, have
relatively few practical applications in board games, at least so far.

Selection Order Bid

Description
Selection Order Bid is a form of multiple-lot auction in which players are not
directly bidding on the lots themselves, but the order in which they’ll draft
the lots. As the bid increases, players may pass and accept a later place in the
order. In some cases, players must pay their entire current bid (an all-pay
mechanism), and in others they may recover some of their bid.

Discussion
There are many systems for auctioning off multiple lots, but Selection Order
Bid may be the most elegant. An elegant example is For Sale, where players
bid to draft first from a collection of property cards. The cards range in value
substantially, and a given flop of cards can either cluster closely, with the

Auctions

311

lowest being separated from the highest by only a few dollars, or they can
be spaced quite widely apart. Players bid in turn order for the right to draft
first. A player may choose to pass and collect the lowest-value card remaining.
When passing, the y pay half their previous bid. The last player to remain
in the auction receives the most valuable card but must also pay his or her
full bid.
Another way to think of the pay-half-when-pass variant is that it’s actually a
simultaneous bid on two lots: a full-price bid on the most valuable money card,
and a half-price bid on the least valuable remaining money card. Considered
in this fashion, Selection Order Bid is a type of constrained bidding system, or
even a sort of ante. If you want to bid $10 on the high-value card at the open
of the auction, you’re essentially agreeing to pay $5 for the lowest-value card,
which you could have had for free. This is somewhat analogous to a penny
auction, where players must pay a fee for each bid they make, even if it is not
the winning bid. The halved value of the bid that will certainly be spent can
be seen as the bid fee, rather than a bid itself.
In certain games this type of auction also forces players to evaluate how
much lots may be worth to other players. For example, if players are collecting
different symbols or colors, the lots will have different values to different
players. If a certain lot is only good for one player, that player can take a
chance and bid low assuming that the lot will be remaining when the player’s
selection opportunity comes.

Multiple-Lot Auction

Description
An auction in which players simultaneously bid on Multiple Lots in parallel,
instead of bidding for one lot at a time serially.

Discussion
Multiple-Lot Auctions are very common in tabletop board games because
they compress the amount of time it takes to allocate lots among the players,
and because the physical affordances of board games, like tableaus and playercolored tokens, lend themselves to organizing and displaying information
needed to run these types of auctions clearly.
Multiple-Lot Auctions ask players to manage two different axes of decision
making at the same time: which lots to bid on, and how to divide money
between those lots, without knowing which lots they might win or lose. In

Auctions

313

a serial auction, a player’s valuation of a later lot might change dramatically
based on winning or losing a previous lot. In an extreme case, like Fresh
Fish, once a player has won a fish market stall, he or she does not bid at all
for a second fish market stall. Simultaneous auctions don’t have this kind of
rebalancing of player valuations.
Another interesting characteristic of Multiple-Lot Auctions is that the
lots themselves may be of entirely different types. A classic Gamemaster
game, originally called Shogun (and later Samurai Swords and Ikusa) features
a Multiple-Lot Bid in which players secretly allocate money to a mix of
auctions and market purchases. Players can assign money to bid for turn
order and for the services of the ninja. The rest of their money can be
allocated to build fortifications, hire ronin and levy additional units. Upon
revealing their secret allocations, the auctions for turn order and ninja are
resolved, and players can then use the other allocated funds to purchase their
fortifications, ronin and other units. Not only are the benefits of turn order
and the ninja quite different from purchasing units or defensive structures,
the auctions themselves operate by somewhat different rules. Any players
bidding on turn order will receive priority over non-bidders in choosing
their preferred ordering—their money grants them some benefit. However,
the ninja auction is an all-pay auction, but only one player will receive the
services of the ninja. If the top bidders are tied, they will pay, but none of
them get to use the ninja!
Multiple-Lot Auctions bear a very close resemblance to another game
mechanism: Area Majority (ARC-02). Though area majority games often
model military conflicts, as in El Grande, they are mathematically similar to
Multiple-Lot Auctions. The troops, or influence cubes, etc. can be abstracted
to bidding tokens, and the player with the highest bids wins the lot. Area
majority games typically offer rewards to more than only the highest bidder.
This is a nested Multiple-Lot Auction. Each different area that players seek
to influence houses its own set of lots, worth different amounts of victory
points to bidders.
Multiple-Lot Auctions are compatible with many other auction
mechanisms like Fixed-Placement Auction (AUC-15), Sealed-Bid Auction
(AUC-04), and Dutch Priority Auction (AUC-16). Their resolution can be
all-pay, winner-pay, cancellation, and others. In some Multiple-Lot Auctions,
players are limited in how many lots or how many types of lots they can win
too. This mechanism is among the most common and most flexible in the
auction family.

Closed-Economy Auction

Description
Closed-Economy is a meta-mechanism that can modify any auction type. In
a Closed-Economy Auction, all the money spent in the auction is paid out to
the auction participants themselves. The total amount of money in the system
never changes.

Discussion
While many auctions feature the winning bid being paid to one of the players
at the table (such as MarraCash or Modern Art), a true Closed Economy is
relatively rare. There’s typically some way to earn more money or inject money
into the system. However, Closed-Economy systems do exist, and are perhaps
more common in constrained bidding systems that feature unique bidding
markers, like Ra.
True Closed Economies create a zero-sum game where each player’s loss
is one or more players’ gain. The auction mechanism provides players with

316

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

opportunities to convert their paper wealth, their opportunity capital, into
actual wealth in the form of in-game resources or benefits. The core dynamic
for players is timing the game properly, and being wealthy at the right time
and poor at the right time.
In some implementations, like Dream Factory, money paid is split among
all the players. In this case, the “remainder” issue needs to be dealt with for
sums of money that don’t divide evenly among the players. Typically this is
handled by leaving the remainder in the center of the table, where it is added
to the next winning bid before being distributed.

Reverse Auction

Description
Players bid to avoid taking the lot up for bid because it has some negative effect.
Common effects include a negative victory point value, or a requirement to
discard something of value such as a resource or special ability. Typically, in
a Reverse Auction all players, except the claimant of the lot, pay their bids.
Sometimes, the lot claimant will receive those payments.

Discussion
No Thanks! is a classic example of Reverse Auctions. The structure of the
auction is Turn Order Until Pass, with a constrained bid of 1 victory point
per bid. Each lot is worth some number of points, but the winner of the game

318

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

is the player with the fewest points. Bidding tokens cancel out one of these
“bad” points, so they’re helpful towards winning the game. When a player
passes, they take both the card and all the bidding tokens placed on the card.
The key mechanism in the game is that each sequence of consecutive cards is
worth bad points equal to the lowest card in the sequence. Thus, a “9” card
is worth 9 bad points to all players, except for the player who already has the
“’10.” For that player, the “9” is actually worth a good point, because the “10”
card will no longer count for them, and instead they’ll get only 9 bad points.
This twist, which leads to players having sharply different values for a given
lot, creates a fascinating auction dynamic.
In the world of classic card games, Hearts stands out as the ReverseAuction variant of the familiar trick-taking genre. In Hearts, players play
with straightforward trick-taking rules, but seek to avoid winning any hearts
in the tricks they collect. Hearts are worth bad points… unless a player
collects all of them (and the Queen of Spades) to “shoot the moon.” In that
case, all the other players collect the bad points for that hand. While trick
taking is its own mechanism, and indeed a genre of games unto itself, it has
a close relationship with auctions, which is a topic we’ll explore in greater
depth in Trick-Taking Games (CAR-01) in Chapter 13. Suffice it to say that
trick taking is almost like a Once-Around Bidding Auction with multiple
currencies. In most games, the tricks are inherently valuable, but in Hearts
they are only meaningful based on whether they contain hearts or the queen
of spades.
In High Society, players bid for valuable possessions and title cards in
traditional auctions, but have reverse auctions for Misfortune cards. The
claimant of the Misfortune card recovers any money cards previously bid to
avoid the lot, but all other players must discard their money cards. In this
implementation, the lot up for bid defines the auction procedure.
By contrast, Eggs & Empire, a simultaneous-bid multilot auction game,
provides auctions that have both positive and negative lots mixed into the same
auction. The player bidding the lowest will be forced to accept the negatively
valued lot. One can think of this auction as a Reverse Auction in which
bidders who avoid the negative lot receive an extra reward, or as a traditional
all-pay auction in which the lowest bidder receives a penalty. Another similar
hybrid auction can be seen in the Game of Thrones board game. Players make
simultaneous sealed bids of power to defeat the Wildlings. If the sum of the
power bid by the players is equal to or greater than the Wildlings’ strength,
the Wildlings are defeated, and the highest bidder receives the benefit of
reclaiming a discarded leader back into their hand. If, however, the sum of

Auctions

319

power bid is less than the strength of the Wildlings, all players must remove
armies from the board equaling two points of unit strength. The lowest bidder
must remove armies equaling four points of unit strength.
As these examples demonstrate, a Reverse Auction is usually implemented
within some more complex auction environment. In part this may be because
Reverse Auctions are inherently negative in experience. The “winner” receives
a negative effect, and the “losers” all pay money. Everyone’s a loser! Because of
this negative experience, designers use Reverse Auctions as a seasoning, a way
to flavor a game, rather than as its central mechanism. No Thanks! remains
the seminal example of a Reverse Auction as the central mechanism of play.

Dexterity Auction

Description
A Dexterity Auction requires performance of some act of dexterity to submit
a valid bid. Typically, this would involve the bid marker itself being placed
into some valid bidding area, but other methods for implementing this may
be used.

Discussion
Going, Going, GONE! by Dr. Scott Nicholson is the design that most readily
comes to mind because of its explicit auction theming. In the game, multiple
items are up for bid simultaneously, and players bid in real time by dropping
their bid tokens into cups corresponding to each lot. Only tokens that land
in the cups count, and the time available for bidding can be fast enough that
placing a bid is not assured.
While Going, Going, GONE! is squarely a Dexterity Auction, one could
perhaps view games like Crokinole and Shuffleboard as being Dexterity
Auctions.
Consider Crokinole, where players flick their bid markers, attempting to
acquire points by occupying board areas. Each side only scores when more of
its markers are in a given scoring zone than the other side. The main difference
between this and an auction is that in Crokinole, if you land 2 more markers
than your opponent in a scoring zone, you score points for each marker. That

Auctions

321

would be like bidding on a diamond and winning one diamond for each
dollar by which you outbid your opponent.
One can readily imagine a mechanism which awards to the player with the
most darts, or stones or markers in some area a singular benefit. This would
be a Dexterity Auction where player skill in landing the bid would be more
important than player intent to bid some amount.
Dexterity Auctions have been implemented in video games that are
boardgame-like in nature, most notably M.U.L.E. and Sumer. In these games,
players move on-screen avatars against the clock, representing offers to buy or
sell. This allows players to “fake” a bid by moving far ahead and then pulling
just behind their opponents as time runs out, to force them into winning an
item at a higher price than they might have intended.
It’s worth noting that dexterity is one of those mechanisms, like memory,
that can be deeply polarizing, and potentially inaccessible to those with
physical disabilities. It can be especially dissonant when it is one component
in a multimechanism game. A game that otherwise emphasizes planning and
calculation may frustrate players when their plans are ruined by an errant toss.

Fixed-Placement Auction

Description
Fixed Placement is a meta-mechanism that modifies a multiple-lot auction
by creating rules about which lots players may bid on, and representing bids
visually on a board or cards. It is often combined with constrained-value bids.
A Fixed-Placement auction ends when every player passes and/or no player has
the right to bid further. The highest bidder for each lot wins the lot.

Discussion
Multiple-Lot Auctions are a fairly common type of auction in board games.
These auctions introduce a new wrinkle into bidding by forcing players to

Auctions

323

evaluate several lots at once. Depending on bid timing rules, there may also be
strategic elements to sequencing your bids or forcing an auction to close early.
Multiple-Lot Auctions present some challenges to tracking. How should
the top bid be represented for each lot? What rules should govern bid order?
How can the game prevent multiple-lot bidding from devolving into a series
of one-lot auctions, in which players ignore all but one lot up for bid at a time?
Fixed Placement can help solve all these problem. Visually, Fixed-Placement
Auctions provide a track on which players can mark the value of their bid
using a player pawn. The right to bid can be governed by turn order. In some
games, like Amun-Re, turn order is interrupted whenever a player is outbid.
That player becomes the active player, who takes the bid marker representing
the bid that was just surpassed and makes another valid bid with it. The entire
auction ends when each player is the top bidder for some lot. In Cyclades,
there are more lots than there are players, but each player has only a single
bidding token, so each player will win exactly one auction, and some lots will
go unpurchased each turn.
Critically, in both of these games, a player may not immediately rebid
on the lot for which they were just outbid. This rule encourages players to
bid close to their actual value for a lot, since if they bid lower, they may not
have an opportunity to return to rebid on that lot. In theory this should
speed these auctions, though in practice, new players may evaluate this
dynamic incorrectly, leading to frustration and overlong analysis. Both of
these games also feature triangular increases in valid bid increments, which
prevents the tit-for-tat, raise-by-one bidding that can grind an auction to
a near-halt.
In Vegas Showdown, bids are submitted strictly in turn order. Bidding too
low has multiple consequences: not only will a player be outbid, but they
will have to wait until the next turn to bid. In the meantime, other players
will get to place bids, potentially raising the costs of lots the passed player
was interested in purchasing. Vegas Showdown does allow immediately
rebidding on the same lot, though the value of the next valid bid increases
in a delayed triangular pattern (each interval is repeated three times before
increasing).
Perhaps the greatest strength of Fixed Placement is that it offers an
opportunity to integrate bidding with other game actions. Since there is a
visible record of current bids, a design can invite players to take unrelated
actions, instead of restricting bidding to its own phase. While Vegas
Showdown takes advantage of this feature, there remains a lot of design
space here.

Dutch Priority Auction

Description
A Dutch Priority Auction, a term of our own invention, is a multiple-lot
auction in which prices for the lots are determined based on the number of
bids placed on the lots up for bid. The winning bidder is the first player, in bid
priority, who chooses to pay the current price for a lot, which is equal to the
number of bidding tokens there. Priority may be determined by a variety of
factors, including global turn order or turn order for each lot based on order
of bid placement. Players may typically pass on the purchase when they are
the priority bidder by removing their bidding token. This has the effect of
reducing the price for the lot by one.

Discussion
A Dutch Priority Auction has features of a Dutch, or descending-bid auction,
coupled with an ordered, turn-based bidding system to help direct traffic and
coordinate the sale of multiple lots simultaneously. In this system, prices will
initially move towards the seller (i.e., they’ll rise) as bids are added, and then
move back towards the buyers, as prices descend when bidders decline to buy
at a given price.
Unlike a traditional Dutch auction, in which any player may accept the
going price and end the auction by calling out, a Dutch Priority Auction
determines an active player, the priority player, who may choose to accept
the going price or pass. In Die Speicherstadt (available in the United States as

326

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Jórvík, with a Viking theme and some minor balance tweaks), this priority is
determined in an initial round of bid-marker placement. Earlier placement
provides earlier priority in the auction resolution phase.
The priority player may choose to pass. In most cases, passing means
removing a bid marker, and thus lowering the asking price by one. Usually,
passing in this kind of auction simply means not acting at this time. If the
passing player has another bid marker at a lower priority, should the auction
continue until that marker comes up, the player will be allowed to purchase
the lot at that time.
Spyrium adds another element to this core, which is that a player, when
passing, receives money equal to the bid markers remaining on the lot. The
choice is between a current purchase at a higher price, or receiving an equal
amount of money, but passing on the purchase. In some cases, an early pass
can fund a later purchase of the same lot!
The effect of this style of auction is to require players to declare the lots
they’re interested in, somewhat separately from the price. Players may not
have enough bid markers to claim the right to bid on every lot they like, and
must restrict themselves to only those lots that are most meaningful to them.
However, bid markers must do double-duty. They cannot only be used to
stake out lots a player desires, they must also be used to raise prices on other
players. There is no other way to raise the price for a lot except to place a bid
marker on it. Bid markers placed late in the first phase may have no other
function, since they are late in the priority order for auction resolution too.

Worker Placement

ӶӶ
Worker Placement, a type of Action Drafting (ACT-02), is often credited
to designer Richard Breese and his game, Keydom, in 1998. Nonetheless, it
was Caylus, by William Attia, that popularized the mechanism and inspired
its name.
Mechanically, Worker Placement is isomorphic to action drafting. Players
select actions in turn order by placing one of their pawns, or workers, into the
action space, or building. This is the core mechanical concept and thematic
conceit, and the mechanism has proven so durable because of that tight
theme-mechanism correspondence. It’s easy to understand why placing the
worker in the sawmill will generate wood.
Worker Placement can be described as action drafting, or even as a highly
specialized type of auction, but while resource allocation mechanisms may
share mathematical similarities and incentivize similar player behavior, the
experience of these mechanisms can vary a great deal based on how they’re
presented. Their intelligibility to the player will also vary a great deal based on
the setting, theme, and logical coherence of the mechanism. For Sale’s auction
is readily understood by players, as it is squarely in context. An auction for
property is a familiar concept, even if most players haven’t ever bought a
house at an auction. The thematic scaffolding, provided by Dungeon Petz,
on the other hand, falls short in terms of making its mechanism intelligible.
Why is it that the largest group of workers secretly assigned to an action get
to take the action first? There’s no strong connection to a real-world dynamic
that helps players remember and understand the rule. The Worker Placement
metaphor of placing a worker in a production building to generate a good
helps players understand the structure and incentives of the underlying game
system, which is one reason why it is such a popular core mechanism.
327

328

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

In this chapter we’ll talk about other implications and expectations of
the mechanism, including blocking, gaining workers, adding buildings, and
more, as we delve deeply into this touchstone of modern design.
The term “Worker Placement” has lost some of its cohesion, and today, it is
often used as a synonym for a Euro-style game, irrespective of the presence of
workers or action drafting. Thus, it would not be out-of-place for Terraforming
Mars or Roll for the Galaxy to be described as “Worker Placement.” We will
restrict our analysis to games which use action drafting, recognize some form
of blocking, and conceive thematically of some kind of worker. This narrower
definition also excludes quite a few games which employ the worker metaphor
but not its underlying mechanism. For example, we exclude cooperative
games like Charterstone and Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island,
because these games lack a true drafting or blocking element. Games with
workers placed onto private tableaus like Orleans and Through The Ages:
A Story of Civilization, or games in which workers represent a currency or bid
marker rather than a draft marker, as in Jórvík, Spyrium, and Keyflower are
also outside the scope of our definition. However, our definition is intended
only to limit the scope of our analysis, and not to stake a claim in how the
term should be used by anybody else. Whatever words we use, we believe
these elements of drafting, blocking, and thematic coherence are important
distinguishers that deserve a term by which to refer to them.

Standard Worker Placement

Description
Players select actions, in turn order, by placing a worker from their supply
on a building associated with a specific action and then execute that action
immediately. The round ends when all workers have been placed, at which
point they return to their owners’ pools and a new round begins.

Discussion
This familiar structure, typified by games like Lords of Waterdeep and
Agricola, is an improvement over the ur-game, Caylus, in which buildings
resolved after all Worker Placements were complete. Immediate resolution
makes for faster play, and obviates the need for players to remember which
resources they will receive when making their next placement. Later games,
like The Manhattan Project and Tzolk’ in: The Mayan Calendar, have workers
returning only when their owners recall them. In the former, players get the
building’s reward on placement, while in the latter, the reward is tied to the
moment of recall, since the reward escalates the longer the worker is left out
on the board. With each passing turn in Tzolk’ in, workers rotate over on the
ingenious gear system to a higher tier of rewards that will be distributed when
the worker is recalled.
Most Worker Placement games employ the mechanism for all actions
in the game. Turn order is typically set by placing a worker on a building
that grants turn order priority. Increasing the number of actions that may
be taken in a turn is themed as getting new workers, which is an action tied

330

to a building. Maintenance costs are represented as feeding or paying for
your workers. Increasingly, there are games that incorporate some Worker
Placement elements in the context of a broader game. Examples include
Copycat, Rococo and Belfort.

Workers of Differing Types

Description
Workers can differ in abilities, or can be upgraded and downgraded, or are
valid for placement in different areas and buildings.

Discussion
Improved workers are a common variation on standard worker placement.
Improved workers can count as more than one basic worker as in Belfort,
or they may allow you to break standard placement rules, like in Leonardo
Da Vinci. Tzolk’ in puts a different spin on this idea by having the rewards
for a space improve the longer that a worker is allowed to stay out on that
space. Thematically, this can be understood as a worker spending more time
working. Another take on this idea is the notion that workers can improve.
In both Praetor, and Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, workers, represented
as dice, are more capable and provide better returns when they show higher
numbers. Players can take actions to increase the values of these worker
dice. In Village, workers can age and gain experience, which improves their
effectiveness.
Some games have workers who participate in different placement contests,
or have buildings that can only be accessed by certain types of workers. Pillars
of the Earth has workers who can collect resources, and master builders, who
are placed during a second round of placement, and who can access other
actions besides resource collection. The Manhattan Project similarly features

332

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

specialists, like scientists and engineers, and certain buildings require those
specialists to operate. Glenn Drover’s Empires: Galactic Rebellion (previously
known as Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery), and Viticulture, feature as
many as eight different kinds of workers who might participate in majority
contests and even battles, in addition to taking actions.

Acquiring and Losing Workers

Description
Workers beyond the original complement may be acquired in some manner,
either temporarily or permanently. Workers may also be lost as the game
progresses.

Discussion
Rather than improving existing workers, many games allow acquisition of
new workers. These new workers represent a substantial growth in a player’s
overall action budget, and as such, acquiring more workers is often a dominant
strategy. In Stone Age, the reproduction hut is typically chosen first or second
in every round. Because of the power of adding workers, designers have
taken to metering worker growth. In Lords of Waterdeep, all players receive
a new worker on a fixed turn in the middle of the game. Caverna requires
that players build housing for new workers to acquire them—an investment
of resources up-front that the new worker’s productivity will pay for in the
future. Any kind of purchase price on a worker has to be considered in light
of the number of actions that worker will be able to take and the returns those
actions will provide. Usually, buying workers early has a higher payout than
buying them late for this reason.
In Last Will, the number of workers a player may deploy varies each turn
based on the place in turn order that they choose. More workers means going
later in the turn order, thus reducing the expected value of those additional

334

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

workers, since the best spots will be taken by the time those extra workers are
up for placement. Euphoria sets a hard cap on the total value of pips that can
be showing in a player’s pool of available worker-dice, which sharply limits a
player’s incentive to collect more workers.
Temporary additional workers are featured in Snowdonia, Russian Railroads,
and Power Grid: Factory Manager. These workers will return to the general
pool after use, and must be hired or acquired again for reuse. A similar way
to throttle player appetites for more workers is through a feeding or worker
upkeep cost for permanent workers. Agricola is famous for the unforgiving
tightness of its feeding mechanism, and the substantial penalties incurred
for failing to feed your family, while Stone Age’s toothless approach makes a
starvation strategy quite viable.
Worker attrition is the flipside of this dynamic of gaining workers.
Euphoria’s workers may get too smart and, as a group, have too high a pip
value, at which point one escapes (or perhaps, is sent for re-education…). The
aging workers of Village eventually pass on, and the workers in Praetor retire.
Other games actively encourage sacrificing workers for a benefit. Asgard is a
visceral example, but discarding a die in Alien Frontiers, themed as landing a
spaceship (the die) on a planet to establish a colony, is mechanically identical.

Workers-As-Dice

Description
Workers are represented by dice whose pip values impact play.

Discussion
Workers-As-Dice is a broad genre, and it is frequently accompanied by the
mechanism of playing a combination of workers in a building. In Alien
Frontiers, players allocate all of their dice on their turns to buildings that take
a different combination of dice and values, and have different requirements for
placement. This approach leads to some analysis paralysis because of the large
number of combinations that are possible with as many as six dice. Other
titles, like Kingsburg, limit the dice pools to three dice. Each roll presents a
substantially smaller set of placement permutations for players to consider, not
only because of the smaller number of dice but because there are fewer valid
buildings for any given combination.
Workers-As-Dice can also function to determine the effectiveness of
workers. In The Artemis Project, worker dice collect a number of resources
equal to their pip value—as long as resources remain available in the supply.
However, the higher pip value dice are awarded resources last, which may
leave the placing player out of luck if the resources run out before they can
collect the reward.
Champions of Midgard features warrior dice whose faces represent attack
strength. The dice are assigned to overcome monsters, and are rolled together,

336

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

summed, and compared to the monster’s strength. For some players, this is
an unacceptable level, and type, of randomness in a worker placement game.
Whatever your position on the matter, it is representative of the ongoing
hybridization of game styles and game mechanisms.
The manner in which the dice change values over the course of the game
can vary. In some games the dice are rolled each turn, giving a random
distribution that players need to work with. Alien Frontiers works in this way.
In other games, the players obtain the dice on a certain side, or have to expend
resources to change them to other, perhaps more powerful, sides.

Adding and Blocking Buildings

Description
Buildings, and their corresponding actions, may be added to the pool of
actions players may select from. Buildings may also be occupied to prevent
or hinder players from accessing those actions.

Discussion
Buildings define available actions in a worker placement game, and how
designers manage the availability of actions is critical to the overall flow of
the game. Some games retain a static set of actions throughout the game,
like Stone Age. Other games introduce new actions in a set pattern. Agricola
features new actions that reveal themselves each round, but the actions are
drawn from a very small subset, guaranteeing, for example, that the “Family
Expansion” action will reveal itself in one of three consecutive rounds.
Many games allow players to add buildings, and to claim ownership for
them. As early as Caylus, players could add a building and receive victory
points when another player occupied it. Lords of Waterdeep has variable owner
rewards for building usage by others. Some games break the core notion of
action drafting by introducing private actions. Russian Railroads themed these
as engineers, rather than buildings, but private buildings, themed as buildings,
exist in The Manhattan Project. On the opposite end of the spectrum are
public actions that are always available to all players, like the resource-gather
actions in Stone Age, which are in a public area, or the brewery actions in Brew

338

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Crafters, which are depicted on each player’s board. The section on Ownership
(ECO-14) has more details on this concept.
Underlying the difference between these actions is the concept of blocking.
Worker placement is a kind of action drafting, and drafting denotes a
dwindling set of possible choices. Worker placement depicts claimed actions
as a building staffed by a worker, so a building that cannot take an additional
worker is considered blocked. The typical worker placement game allows
each building to be used by one player each round, and is blocked when
one worker is in it. Modest exceptions allow for two or three players to use a
building—an easy way to scale the actions available in a game as the player
count increases.
Some games eschew “hard” blocking in favor of “soft” blocking. In Coal
Baron, players don’t block buildings by occupying them, they simply increase
the costs of other players accessing them. Carson City, a Western-themed
game, has workers in the same space duel to see who claims its reward.
Bumping, another kind of soft blocking, allows an occupied building to be
reused, but the worker currently occupying the building is removed, and
the owner gains some kind of bonus. In Euphoria, a game which otherwise
requires players to spend a turn recalling workers, simply the act of being
bumped is beneficial to the player being bumped—an especially elegant
combination of mechanisms.
Blocking is a player-driven placement restriction, but the game itself may
impose placement restrictions as well. Some games require multiple workers
to be played in order to activate a space, as in Russian Railroads or Francis
Drake. This is especially common among Worker-As-Dice games. Sometimes,
players must exceed a particular pip value with one or more dice. Other
times, a building calls for a sequential run of dice or a pair or larger set of
values, like in Alien Frontiers. Both Egizia and Francis Drake establish a linear
relationship between buildings, such that once you skip over a closer building
to activate one further down the river or road, respectively, you can never
go back. A more prosaic placement restriction is a cost, like in the case of a
resource-conversion or building action, which requires inputting resources
to build some finished product or obtain some advanced resource. Kingdom
of Solomon offers players bonus action buildings that are substantially more
powerful than the standard spaces, but which require assigning all remaining
workers. This can be viewed as a declining price auction (AUC-08) for these
bonus actions, with the price expressed in terms of workers, that is folded into
the larger worker placement structure.

Single Workers

Description
Players control only a Single primary Worker and cannot acquire more
workers.

Discussion
On the far end of the worker placement spectrum are the Single-Worker
games, which we include in our definition only when they retain a
blocking element—otherwise, we characterize these as Action Point games
(ACT-01) when players can’t interfere with or block each other at all,
and Action Drafting games (ACT-02) when players can block each other
absolutely.
In the intermediate space between these lies a game like Kanban. Players
block and influence each other’s placements along at least three different
axes: (1) players cannot take an action space occupied by another player,
(2) they cannot take an action space in the same department they occupied
last turn, and (3) they must consider the role Sandra, the neutral boss,
will play. In Easy mode, Sandra’s presence in a department may encourage
players to work in that department in order to win her approval. In Hard
mode, they may choose to avoid Sandra’s critical eye and the penalties that
accompany it.
Another Vital Lacerda game, The Gallerist, takes an opposite approach
to Single-Worker blocking. Players have a primary worker, and can acquire

Worker Placement

341

several assistants. When players move their primary worker to a new space,
they may choose to leave an assistant behind. If that assistant gets bumped by
another player, the assistant will be able to take an action as compensation.
In a sense, the game records a kind of history of where each player has been,
and enforces consequences for collisions, snake-like, between the head of one
player and the tail of another. It is arguable whether this actually qualifies
for our definition of worker placement, though, since no cost is imposed on
the placing player in a manner that could be construed as blocking. Instead,
a benefit is given to the player whose assistant is being bumped. Istanbul
implements this trail concept more fully, and is perhaps the game that most
successfully implements substantial movement and spatial relationships
within a worker placement framework. Here, blocking is more fully realized,
as the placing player must pay the blocker to use the space.
Single-Worker games are quite similar not only to role-selection games,
as mentioned above, but also to Rondel Games (ACT-10) and Time Track
Games (TRN-13). The worker metaphor and the use of meeples and similar
tokens has as much to do with how we categorize the games as the underlying
action selection method itself.

Building Actions and Rewards

Description
Buildings can offer varying rewards to different players, based on ownership
and turn order, or they may be upgraded to increase their rewards to all
players.

Discussion
Buildings may offer a greater reward for the first player to claim the building
and lesser rewards for players following. This is quite similar to selection
bonuses in a role selection game, a flavor of Action Drafting (ACT-02). Other
versions of reward choice allow for the player to choose among one of two
or more rewards, as in Caylus, where players may sometimes take two of one
resource or one of another. Yedo offers an extreme version of this mechanism:
players place workers in districts, rather than specific buildings, and may
choose from a variety of possible resolutions, including collecting resources,
purchasing weapons, or completing a mission specific to that district.

Worker Placement

343

One way buildings can vary in rewards is through improvements of
different kinds. In Wisdom of Solomon (originally released as Kingdom of
Solomon), players can build roads between different spaces, creating resource
regions that yield the cumulative benefit of all the connected spaces when
activated by a worker. In Agricola, and other Uwe Rosenberg designs, some
spaces will accumulate an additional resource from turn to turn, growing
richer and richer until a player finally selects them. Various games offer cards
or special abilities that improve the conversion rate of some building or set
of buildings that have a cost or offer some exchange. Conversely, buildings
may become deactivated or workers may be hindered from doing their work,
as with the Provost in Caylus or the City Watch in Yedo. A radical approach
to varying buildings can be seen in Fabled Fruit, in which buildings can be
replaced entirely with others in mid-play.

Turn Order and Resolution Order

Description
Worker placement is ultimately a drafting mechanism, and the order by which
actions are selected and resolved is an opportunity for design variations.

Discussion
Allocation of resources is a foundational concern of nearly every game, and
allocation by draft means that Turn Order is crucial. While some worker
placement games simply rotate Turn Order clockwise, like Stone Age, most fold
Turn Order into the worker placement engine itself. The simplest approach
is a building that grants Turn Order priority, as in Lords of Waterdeep. While
this is a simple approach, it has a substantial drawback in that it’s a choice
with strong left-right binding. In other words, the impacts on the players
adjacent to the new starting player are large: the player to the left gains an

Worker Placement

345

unearned windfall because they get to go second, and the player to the right,
through no fault of their own, is pushed to the end of line. One design answer
is to allow for multiple players to play into the Turn Order building, with the
player playing earliest getting the most favorable placement. More discussions
of this topic are in Claim Turn Order Action (TRN-05).
As discussed in Acquiring and Losing Workers (WPL-03), Last Will has
players draft a combination of Turn Order, workers available, and assistant
actions in one. Earlier positions in Turn Order have fewer workers and
abilities, while later positions have more.
An especially unusual mechanism for Turn Order is the master builder
token-pull system in Pillars of the Earth. Each player’s master builders are
placed in a bag and pulled at random, one at a time. The player whose builder
is pulled may choose to pay the current price in gold to take the action, or
may pass and accept a much later position in Turn Order. The price of the
action is then decreased by one gold. If this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s
another variation on the Vickrey auction (AUC-08, Dutch Auction). See also
Random Turn Order (TRN-11).
The randomness of this mechanism drew widespread critique, but it did
have a spiritual successor. In Lords of Waterdeep, up to three players can visit
Waterdeep Harbor to play an Intrigue card. In addition, once all players
have exhausted their available workers, the workers assigned to Waterdeep
Harbor can be reassigned to any available actions space. The similarity to the
mechanism in Pillars of the Earth is that placing a worker in Waterdeep Harbor
offers the reward of playing an Intrigue card, at the cost of having to wait for
the remaining workers to be placed before getting another choice at an action
with that worker. This implied cost goes down with every succeeding turn,
just as the explicit cost of the master builder goes down with each player’s
turn. The random aspect of Pillars of the Earth was not reproduced, but the
core notion of variable price for placement priority was retained.
Returning to variations on Turn Order, Francis Drake has Turn Order for
the following phase set by the previous phase. The player who takes the fewest
actions in the first phase goes first in the next phase. Belfort allows players to
spend a worker to exchange Turn Order position with another player during
the placement phase. However, the game features a strong polarity in the
benefits of Turn Order. In the worker placement phase, going early is best,
but in the building phase, which features an area majority contest, going last
is most advantageous.
This phase difference brings up another point of design distinction, which
is when worker actions get placed versus when they get resolved. The simplest

346

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

placement rule is that each player places one worker on their turn (Agricola),
which encourages good pace in play. Increasing the complexity, players may
be allowed to claim a building, even if it requires more than one worker
(Francis Drake), or may be allowed to play either one worker, or assign all
their remaining workers to a group of public action (Belfort). Sometimes, each
player places all their workers on their turn (Alien Frontiers).
Placement is not synonymous with resolution, however. Caylus resolved
placements and distributed rewards only at the end of the placement phase,
when all workers are out. This delay in resolution creates space for the provost
mechanism, which may cause buildings too far down the road to fail to
activate, even though they are staffed by workers. It also allows players to
set up combos, where resources gained earlier along the road can be used by
workers further down the road, regardless of the order that those workers were
placed in. Similarly, the Tzolk’ in escalating rewards case requires resolution to
occur when workers are recalled, rather than placed. However, in Tzolk’ in, the
decision is to either place a worker, or return all workers from one building,
rather than recalling the whole class of workers from across the board. Belfort
workers don’t collect their goods until all players have completed placement,
because the player with the most workers gathering in each building will gain
a bonus resource.
When workers return home is another element of the worker placement
mechanism that designers have experimented with. In The Manhattan Project
players resolve their actions on worker placement, but must spend a turn
retrieving workers. This tends to create a strong blocking dynamic, since
players receive benefits up front, and their workers continue to block other
players until they are retrieved. Timing your retrievals relative to other players
is critical for effective play. In Istanbul workers can be retrieved for free by
moving back through the spaces they were left on, or by spending a valuable
action recalling all workers to the fountain in the center of the bazaar.
Through careful planning, players can plot efficient courses, recover workers
for free, and gain an action advantage over their opponents.

Movement

ӶӶ
Perhaps the most common dynamic in games is movement. In large part this
is because movement is inherent in what games model, whether it’s an armed
conflict, a journey, or a race. Movement is an incredibly effective and powerful
tool in the designer’s arsenal because of how dense movement can be in terms
of information. Moving a single piece changes its relationship to every other
piece on the board. And yet, signaling that change, communicating that it
has occurred, is as simple as picking up a piece and placing it down again.
The most ancient board games we know of, like the Egyptian games
Mehen and Senet, have pieces moving around a board. Chess, Checkers, Shogi,
Parcheesi, Backgammon, Monopoly, and Candyland, all feature movement
as a key mechanism. Some of these games feature movement in a single
direction, along a fixed path, while others offer greater choice, or even free
play within a two-dimensional space. In some games, the pieces on the board
are all identical, while in others the power to move is encoded in the pieces
themselves. Some games have specific spaces that are more valuable to occupy,
while in others the positional value of any space can change as the board
develops.
Movement is a way of creating dynamic and evolving situations, which can
force players to change their plans and react to their opponents. Done well,
movement rules are easily understood, yet lead to emergent gameplay. But
movement rules are hard to get right. Dealing with questions like blocking,
line of sight, terrain types, movement along a diagonal, and more, can turn
what seems like an elegant and simple concept into a tangle of conflicting
and confusing rules. Among the innovations of the European design school
was an increasing abstraction of movement rules, or even total abandonment
of movement.
349

350

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Despite the challenges, movement remains a durable feature of many board
games. Movement is fun, and it lends itself well to many different kinds of
games in a huge variety of implementations and specific mechanisms, while
being conceptually familiar and intuitive, no matter what the context.

Tessellation

Description
The playing field is divided into spaces to regulate movement.

Discussion
There are several ways to sub-divide boards, all of which are covered in this
section.
The most basic is a one-dimensional division. This is often called a track,
and it is commonly used in Race games, Roll and Move games, and others.
There are several variations on the standard track.
First, there may be alternate paths that branch off of the main path. These
can be a shortcut that reduces the distance needed to travel, or a path that
gives bonuses or other information, as in Careers, where each potential career
choice has its own path.

352

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Second, certain spaces, or collections of spaces, may be divided into subspaces the width of the track. This is typically used in racing games to create
lanes, allowing multiple players to occupy the same space, and to create
“inside” and “outside” lanes. The number of lane spaces can be reduced,
sometimes even down to one, to create bottlenecks that create challenges
for players. This is used to great effect in Ave Caesar and Downforce, where
vehicles move a set number of spaces based on cards. Forcing players
to waste a good card because they cannot get through a bottleneck is a
key strategy.
Boards can also be laid out in two dimensions, either with a regular pattern
or irregular shapes. The most common regular patterns are squares (as in
Chess) and hexagons, used in many wargames, such as PanzerBlitz. Triangles
may also be used, but are uncommon as they limit options for adjacency, and
tend to look busy.
If squares are used, the designer needs to decide if pieces may move
diagonally. From a distance standpoint, a diagonal move is approximately
50% further than an orthogonal move, which needs to be compensated for
in games striving for realism. Hexagonal Tessellations do not have this issue,
and all natural moves are the same distance. This is why they are commonly
used for wargames and others require realistic movement. Note that a square
grid with each row shifted 50%, making a brick pattern, is isomorphic to
a hex grid (and easier to prototype, particularly when creating tiles—even
rectangular cards can be used for this purpose).
Some games need to model three-dimensional space, typically those that
take place in space, in the air, or under the sea. A common approach is a
dashboard or log sheet for each vehicle that tracks the altitude. This system
is used in Richtofen’s War and Air Force. Some, like Attack Vector: Tactical,
have tokens placed next to or beneath pieces to indicate height above or below
the playing surface. Others, like Chopper Strike and Sub Search, physically
create multiple levels of play area by vertically stacking boards, separated by
supports. These are physically striking and easy for players to interpret, but
need to limit the number of levels due to cost, physical size of the board, and
ease of reaching in between levels to reach pieces.
Irregular patterns are called Area Maps. Diplomacy is an example.
There are several design considerations for Area Maps. First, if they
regulate movement, the areas should be approximately the same size, or
at least “movement equivalent.” For example, a mountainous region may
be divided into smaller, more numerous spaces so it takes more moves to
traverse.

Movement

353

If possible, regions should not touch at a corner, they should only touch
along an edge.
Area maps are isomorphic to point-to-point movement, where boxes
or circles are connected by lines. Sometimes point-to-point maps can be
preferable, as they clearly show connections, and connection information (like
rivers or borders) may be more evident. Point-to-point maps are also common
in space games, where the connection between stars is shown.
Some maps are a combination of two-dimensional point-to-point and onedimensional tracks. For example, Trains and Stations has tracks in between
cities that players must build along.
If a region contains important information, like terrain type or resources,
the graphics should be visible and distinct even if pieces are present.

Roll and Move

Description
A randomizer is used to determine how far to move a piece. The space landed
on determines the action(s) a player can take.

Discussion
Roll-and-Move games are emblematic of many of the earliest games people
are exposed to. This Roll-and-Move mechanism has also been used in some
of the oldest known games, including Senet and Backgammon.
Because Roll and Move has been used in so many simplistic children’s
games, it has the reputation as an anti-pattern. Players do not feel in control
of their actions, and are at the mercy of the randomizer, which could be dice
(Monopoly), a spinner (Chutes and Ladders) or cards (Candyland).
To mitigate this, the designer should extend the mechanism to allow for
more player choice. One way is to give the players more ways to apply the
results of the randomizer, as in Backgammon, where the player can use the
dice in a variety of ways. Other options are to have mechanisms that allow
the players to modify, use a subset of the number, or choose direction, as
in Talisman, wager on movement as in Long Shot and Camel Up, or wrap
it in a Push-Your-Luck mechanism like Nur Peanuts!. Other options are
discussed in the following sections: Different Dice (MOV-07) and Probability
Management (UNC-09).

Pattern Movement

Description
Pieces move in a specific pattern relative to the board grid.

Discussion
This Pattern Movement mechanism gives pieces specific ways that they can
move relative to a grid. There are three basic styles:
1. Fixed Target Spaces: This is similar to the way that knights move in
Chess. There are a few specified target squares, and the piece may be
moved to any of them. They may or may not be able to jump over spaces
that are blocked by friendly or enemy pieces. These moves do not need
to be reversible. While a Chess knight may return to the square it came
from, a pawn may not move backwards. In Shogi the Gold, for example,
may move diagonally forward, but not diagonally backward (although
it may move straight backward).

358

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

2. Any Distance in a Direction: The Queen in Chess would be an example of
this movement style. Pieces may move any number of spaces in a given
direction, until blocked by another piece. Sometimes, the directions are
fixed relative to the board, so pieces cannot return to where they came
from. The Lance in Shogi, for example, may move any distance forward,
but may never move backward until it is promoted.
3. Jumping: Jumping over pieces may be a requirement for moving or may
be used to capture. Sometimes jumps can be chained, as in Draughts
(Checkers) and Chinese Checkers, which can lead to dynamic and
dramatic play.
Games with Pattern Movement often have a Promotion mechanism, where
pieces that reach the end of the board (or close to the end, as in Shogi) are
converted into a more powerful version of the piece.
Navia Dratp has pieces that promote by spending a currency to upgrade
them. It is earned by moving and capturing, and different pieces cost different
amounts to upgrade, which gives a great tool for balancing.
A different take on Promotion is shown by The Duke, where pieces are tiles
with different movement patterns on either side. When a piece is moved, it is
flipped over to its other side.
Movement Patterns can be difficult to learn if there is a different pattern for
each piece, and it is not part of the piece, as in Chess or Shogi. However, some
modern games, such as the aforementioned Navia Dratp and The Duke, print
the movement pattern directly onto the piece, which makes it much smoother
for newer players to learn and allows for even more different styles of pieces.
Nevertheless, games like The Duke do present players with the challenge of
remembering the movement pattern on the reverse side of each piece. Player
references can help alleviate these issues.

359

Movement Points

Description
A piece is given a number of points to spend on movement.

Discussion
This Movement Points mechanism allows the designer to differentiate units
as well as movement conditions. It is commonly used in wargames, as in
Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, for example, where infantry units have
three movement points, and armor units have six. However, it is also used
in train games like Empire Builder and racing games like Formula De to
control movement. Normally, each space takes one Movement Point, but
certain obstacles and terrain, like mountains, or swamps, may take more. In
more tactical games, rivers and roads may slow or accelerate movement by
controlling how many Movement Points are used. Movement Points may be
further generalized as Action Points (ACT-01), where movement is just one
of the actions that points may be spent on, as in Tikal.
Another extension is to allow normal Movement Points to be increased
by incurring some limitation or penalty. For example, many wargames allow
for units to “double-time” or “redeploy” at the expense of not being able to
conduct an attack or come within a certain distance of an opposing unit.
Others allow units to take on a status of “exhausted” by moving farther than
normal, but having their other skills degraded until a “rest” turn is taken.

Resource to Move

Description
Players expend a Resource to Move.

Discussion
Games where players are moving a limited number of pieces (typically one)
may give them a resource that needs to be expended to move. This can take
the form of a card with a numeric value, as in Ave Caesar or Ben Hur, or it
can be a currency such as fuel or something more abstract. In Hare & Tortoise,
players need to spend carrots to move, and can acquire them through various
actions.
The resource may also have to be expended to change velocity. This is
most commonly seen in space games, like Attack Vector: Tactical, where fuel
modifies velocities. However, it can also apply to traditional racing games,
like Mississippi Queen, where players are racing steamships on the Mississippi
River. In Mississippi Queen, players may normally increase or decrease their
speed by one. If they wish to accelerate or decelerate at a higher rate, they
must expend coal, which is a limited resource.
Scotland Yard gives players a limited number of tickets of different types—
Subway or Bus for example—one of which must be used each turn depending
on the type of transportation taken. If the detectives exhaust their tickets
before catching Mr. X, they lose the game.

Giving players a resource that they need to manage is one way to mitigate
the common issues with random Roll-and-Move games (MOV-02), as it
increases player choice.

Measurement

Description
Pieces may be moved up to a certain distance, measured by a ruler.

Discussion
In this Measurement system there is no grid or other tessellation breaking
up the map. Pieces are free to move any amount up to their movement limit,
expressed in inches, centimeters, or using a game-supply ruler. This system is
typically seen in miniatures games, which are played directly on a table top.
Because of the analog nature of Measurement, these systems have several
unique issues they need to deal with. First, attack, like movement, is also
expressed in the Measurement units. The designer needs to decide whether to
allow for Measurement at any time to determine range, or only after attacks
or moves have been declared. Not allowing premeasurement gives an edge
to players that are better at estimating ranges but tends to make for a lighter
experience as sophisticated plans and strategies may fall apart because a
charge falls a fraction of a centimeter short. Most modern games allow for
premeasurement, although this does slow things down.
This is compounded by the second issue, that there is always some
imprecision in moving and Measurement. These systems require players to
communicate about intent of moves, and to act in a reasonable fashion.

364

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Finally, unlike Movement Points systems (MOV-04), measuring can be
challenging with different terrain types. Does movement in difficult terrain
count as moving “farther” than in other terrain? How are those Measurements
handled? These considerations make games more complex. These downsides
are offset by games that feel more cinematic and realistic due to the openended nature of the scenery, movement, and combat.

Different Dice

Description
Different Dice are used to move depending on unit or game state.

Discussion
As an alternative to giving fixed Movement Points to units (MOV-04), this
mechanism assigns a particular die or dice that are rolled to determine how
far a unit may move. This introduces some randomness in movement rates
but allows the player (and designer) to control the range.
In Formula De, each gear is represented by a different die. Players roll the
specific gear die to see how far they will move. These are special dice that
have a specific min and max value—the D20 5th gear die, for example, goes
from 21 to 30.
Battleball assigns a different die to each unit—D6s for the slow linesman,
and D20s for the speedy wide receivers. In this case, however, the dice are
standard, and go from 1 to 6 or 1 to 20 in these particular cases. This makes
the wide receivers much more variable.
In the dog-sled racing game Mush, dogs are represented by different dice
depending on the type of weather they prefer.

366

One of the advantages of this system is that there is very little rules
overhead. Once the die is selected, you roll it to generate that number of
Movement Points.

Drift

Description
Two movement cards are played to move. The sum represents the distance
forward moved; the difference represents the sideways movement (Drift).

Discussion
First introduced in the dog-sled racing game, Snow Tails, this Drift system is
both thematic and gives players options for clever play. Each of the two dogs
pulling the sled has a number card placed on it. The sled is moved forward by
the sum of the numbers, and it must change lanes equal to the difference, in
the direction of the dog that was assigned the higher number.
Since players may only play one card per turn (with the card on the other
dog remaining the same), careful management of resource, and how you Drift
through the course, is essential for winning play.
While this system has not been used outside of Snow Tails and its successor
Mush! Mush!: Snow Tails 2, we feel that it is worth including here because
it shows how different movement mechanisms can be thematic, clever, and
straightforward. It may well be that the close consonance between theme and
mechanism is precisely why this hasn’t been reused.

Impulse

Description
A turn is broken up into a series of small Impulses. Depending on their speed,
units will be able to move in specific Impulses.

Discussion
Originally pioneered in Star Fleet Battles, this system simulates simultaneous
movement of player pieces. Rather than one player moving their full distance,
and then the next, moves are interleaved. There is a chart that shows which
Impulses a ship will move in for different speeds. When a ship becomes active,
it moves a single hex.
As an example, in Star Fleet Battles, ships may have speeds from 0 to 16,
so there are 16 Impulses. A ship that is moving at speed 4 will move every
fourth Impulse. A ship that is moving at speed 6 will move in Impulses 3, 6,
8, 11, 14, and 16.

370

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

This system increases realism by having ships gradually approach each
other, rather than jump to a new location and fire from there. However, it
does so at an increase in complexity and bookkeeping that requires one of
the players to keep track of the progress of the turn, and alert players to when
particular ships need to move.

Programmed Movement

Description
Players simultaneously program their movement, and then reveal and execute it.

Discussion
This is a subset of Action Queues (ACT-06), so the considerations there apply.
However, there are some specifics relating to movement to cover here.
First is the Right-Left issue. Programmed Movement games often have
turning as one of the orders. Robo Rally is an example. This can often be
difficult for players to visualize and can result in turning the wrong way. It
can be beneficial to have the turn cards labeled as Clockwise and CounterClockwise, rather than Right or Left, as these may be simpler for players to
visualize, but the issue remains.
To avoid this, some Programmed Movement games either have a generic
Turn action, allowing the players to choose facing at that time, or allow free
rotations. The Dragon & Flagon is an example.
Another is how challenging the spatial puzzle will be, and how that fits into
the game theme. Robo Rally creates a complex space for players to navigate by

372

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

constraining them in two ways. First, players draw a hand of nine cards, and
must select five to be programmed. It is frequent that players do not have the
exact cards they need to get where they would like to go, so that forces them to
evaluate a variety of alternatives. In addition, there are features on the board
like conveyor belts, pits, and pushers that, although deterministic, make it
even more challenging to picture the result of a sequence of cards. There is also
bumping—if players move into the same space as another robot, they push
it out of the square, which can have a huge effect on where that robot ends
up. Then, if robots take damage, they may have cards “locked” into place,
making coming up with a plan even more challenging. All of these elements
foster a feeling of chaos, which is the goal of Robo Rally, which players tend
to either love or hate.
Space Cadets uses a similar system, with cards being drawn and placed in
sequence to plot movement. But it gives a little more control to players, as
there are fewer obstacles on the board, and ships pass through each other or
may occupy the same space. Players also have more control, as they can slow
down, reducing the number of cards played, or allocating more of the Energy
resource to Helm, allowing for more cards to be drawn.
Another lever for the designer is the number of cards to be placed in the
queue. This materially impacts the complexity of planning. While Robo Rally
has players plot five cards, duck! duck! Go only has them plot one, befitting
its intended younger audience. Volt: Robot Battle Arena has players place a
die on a chart indicating the direction they want to move, with the die face
indicating the distance. There is no facing—robots can move or shoot in
any direction chosen. This puts the emphasis in Volt: Robot Battle Arena on
guessing what the opponents will do, rather than on how to control your
own robot.

Relative Position

Description
The precise location of units is not tracked. Only their Relative Position is
important.

Discussion
The standard use case for this mechanism is in racing games that track relative
order but not specific position. For example, in Formula Motor Racing, the
cars for the players are simply in sequence from first place to last. Players
take actions to try to move further up towards the front of the line and be in
first place when the game ends. The distance between first and second place
is always the same. There is no further representation of distance or gaps
between cars.
Similarly, in Get Bit!, players are swimmers trying to escape from a shark,
and only their relative position is tracked. The shark attacks the player last
in line.

374

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

This system has the benefit of simplicity and focuses on specific aspects of
racing. It also eliminates the need for a board, track, or lanes, and the rules
and space overhead that go with that. It also keeps the games competitive, as
it is literally impossible for a car to get too far into the lead to catch or drop
too far behind the leader. Everything is constrained.
Roadkill is a hybrid version of this system, which has a series of location
cards that players race through. Not all players need to be on the same location
card, but those that are placed in a ranked line.
Another type of Relative system is used in Up Front. This card-based tactical
combat game has squads that move toward or away from other squads. Their
location is represented by an abstract concept called Relative Range, which
goes from 1 (far away) to 5 (right on top of each other). Abstracting movement
in this way allows Up Front to focus on other tactical elements of the battle.
Racing or movement does not need to be the central metaphor for use of
this mechanism. In Guillotine, players manipulate a line a people, with the
character at the head of the line needing to put their head on the chopping
block.

Mancala

Description
Movement is based on the number of units at the starting location.

Discussion
This system arises from a family of games from Africa, most notably Mancala.
In Mancala, the board is a series of pits organized essentially in a ring. Various
numbers of playing pieces are in each pit. On their turn, a player selects a pit
and removes all the pieces in that pit, and places one in each successive pit in
a single direction. If there are three pieces in a pit, for example, one each will
be placed in each of the next three pits going around the ring.
A common variation on this mechanism is that only one piece moves, but
the distance it gets to move is exactly equal to the number of pieces in the
space it starts in. In Finca, this system is used to move around a Rondel for
action selection (ACT-10), and all pieces, regardless of owner, count toward
the distance moved. Finca also has the twist that the strength of the action
is based on the number of tokens in the destination space. In Downfall of
Pompeii, players begin the game by placing their pawns into buildings in the
city. After the first eruption, players can add pawns to a building equal to
the number of pawns already in the building, and finally, after the second

376

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

eruption, players move pawns a number of spaces equal to the number of
pawns on the originating space.
In Theseus: The Dark Orbit, players move their pieces around a space station,
again based on the number of pieces located in the starting area. However,
they have the choice of going clockwise or counter-clockwise.
These systems have a lot of opportunity for clever play and are highly
interactive as pieces from all players are commingled and directly impact the
options available to each.

Chaining

Description
Pieces are stationary but are built out in chains.

Discussion
While the pieces in these games are stationary, building them in chains gives
a dynamic feel of movement. In fact, most of these games are typically about
taking journeys and traveling.
In Expedition and Lazer Ryderz, players place a chain of arrow tokens or
templates to show the path they are taking. They are considered to be at the
tip of the chain. In both cases, if the chains cross, something special happens,
which is the rationale for leaving the chain.
In Through the Desert and Quartermaster General, players do not have to
play from the tip of the chain. They may extend from anywhere. This is more
in keeping with the themes of establishing caravans or supply lines.
Using chains, rather than just a single unit, creates opportunities to
blockade other players, forcing them to cross your path, or topologically
isolate them. The static nature of the placements makes these games simple
to teach but can open up tactical options for deeper play.

Bias

Description
Pieces automatically move in a certain direction, or it is easier to move in a
certain direction.

Discussion
The Bias mechanism is typically used to simulate wind, currents, conveyor
belts, and other physical systems. There are typically two types: Automatic
and Influencers. Automatic Bias mechanisms move pieces in a set direction,
typically at the end of each turn. An example is the conveyor belts in Robo
Rally, which automatically move all robots on them, as well as possibly rotating
them. Others are the rivers in Niagara and The Adventurers: The Temple of
Chac, which slide all pieces on the river toward the falls, or the magnets or
fans in Darter. This is also commonly seen as gravity in space games, such as
Demon’s Run, which move players that go too close to black holes.
These effects are often indicated to the player by arrows on the board
showing the effect on pieces. If movable elements are causing the effect,
iconography on the piece is often used.
Influencer mechanisms make it easier to move in certain directions. This
is very common in sailing games, but it can also be seen in other themes, like
mountain climbing. In Yacht Race, the distance a ship can move is directly
related to the wind direction.

380

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

This mechanism can give texture to an otherwise featureless map, as in a
sailing or space game. When players have some control over the element in
question (moving magnets in Darter, or changing wind direction in Yacht
Race), it can present the players with really interesting tactical possibilities. For
example, in Niagara players can influence how fast the river flows each turn.
These mechanisms need to be used with some care, particularly with
automatic biases when positioning is critical. If the system gets complicated,
it can be difficult for players to picture where they will be at the end of their
turn, particularly if this is combined with Programmed Movement (MOV-10),
as in Robo Rally.
There are more complex variations on the mechanism. One is Gravwell:
Escape from the 9th Dimension, where the Bias point depends on player location.
Players move relative to the closest ship to them, whether ahead or behind.
A related mechanism is used in Tutankhamen. Players move along a track
and may only move in one direction. They may move as far as they want,
but only get to use the ability of a piece they land on. This one-way nature
of the board gives the players challenging decisions of whether to race ahead
for a desirable space further along the track, or to move slowly and get more
actions, but have to use only those spaces skipped by other players.

Moving Multiple Units

Description
Actions may Move one or Multiple Units.

Discussion
This is a subset of Command Cards (ACT-05). The considerations there apply.
This mechanism is used in its Command Card form by Thunder Alley,
where players control a number of cars, and the cards are used to move a
subset of them.
There are also games where players play cards that move Multiple pieces
that may or may not belong to them. The Wolfgang Kramer card system,
which includes Daytona 500 and Downforce, gives players a hand of cards,
each of which moves cars that may belong to them or to opponents. The key
to the game is playing cards at a time when the cars you want to move a
long way forward are relatively clear and can use the full movement, whereas
cars you are not interested in are blocked in and waste some or all of the
movement.
This type of system is frequently associated with Betting (UNC-01),
allowing player interests to overlap or conflict at different points.
Another example is Panamax. In this game, ships move through the
Panama Canal, and certain sections are too narrow for ships to pass each
other. So, if you wish to move your ship in that section, it pushes ships ahead
of them, giving them free movement.

Map Addition

Description
The map is added to as it is explored.

Discussion
This Map Addition mechanism is commonly used in exploration games, as
players expose new areas of the map. There are two broad types of games in
this category: Constrained, where the shape of the board is known, and players
must explore within those bounds, and Unconstrained, where players are free
to explore as they wish (sometimes with some rules). There are also games
where the map shape is defined by the scenario or mission but is hidden by
the game mechanics, as in The 7th Continent, or known to only one player, as
in Descent: Journeys in the Dark.
This mechanism is often implemented with tiles, and so is a subset of Tile
Laying. Much of that discussion applies here. But there are some specific
points for map building.
If players can build in any direction, it may keep them somewhat separated
as each explores their own area. If more interaction is desired, some incentive

384

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

to move to the center needs to be included. The cooperative real-time game
Escape: The Curse of the Temple implements this rather bluntly, by requiring
players to gather on a single tile periodically. In the stress and hurry of a realtime game, it can be challenging to avoid getting spread out.
If using tiles, edges can be used to gate movement. For example, in Eclipse,
tiles may be marked with a gate or be blank. If two gates match up on adjacent
tiles, players may move between them. Later, a technology may be developed
that permits movement even if only one gate is between two tiles. This allows
for structure and movement restrictions even in the openness of space.
The Map Addition mechanism can also be used to introduce uncertainty
into an essentially linear track. In Mississippi Queen and The Mushroom Eaters,
new portions of the track are revealed as they are moved onto. In Mississippi
Queen, this acts as a type of Catch-The-Leader mechanism (VIC-18), as the
leader may be out of position to take advantage of the newly revealed tile.
Exploration can also be procedurally generated. In Source of the Nile, when
exploring an empty hex, players roll on a series of tables to determine the
base terrain type, rivers, and other features. The system cleverly incorporates
adjacent spaces to make it more likely, for example, for a block of adjacent
jungle spaces to emerge rather than a series of isolated jungle spaces.

Map Reduction

Description
Over the course of the game, the map shrinks.

Discussion
Removing parts of the map can be psychologically interesting for the players,
as they feel more constricted both in space and options. We are exposed to this
Map Reduction mechanism first as children through the game Musical Chairs.

386

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Isolation and Hey, That’s My Fish! are classic representatives of this
mechanism. In both, players take a move and then remove a tile. In Isolation,
it may be any tile on the board. In contrast, in Hey That’s My Fish, it must be
the tile that the player began their turn on.
In Sinking of the Titanic, the board is shrunk in a fixed fashion, rather
than under player control, as the ship rotates beneath the water board and
the board gradually becomes reduced more and more.
In some games, the board closing is something that happens toward the
end of the game. In The Omega Virus sectors of the board may suddenly be
closed to the players completely as the game nears its timed conclusion.
Also worth mentioning are the Survive: Escape From Atlantis series of
games, where the board as a whole does not shrink, but safe tiles (land tiles
in this case) are slowly removed, forcing players into shark-infested waters.
Many other games don’t shrink the physical board; they simply reduce the
options available to the players. Ticket to Ride and many other rails games
naturally reduce the options available to players as more and more routes
get claimed. To a substantial extent, the question of whether the board
gets smaller or the options on it become fewer is mostly a matter of thematic
consonance and what is practical given the physical components involved.

Map Deformation

Description
The map is modified during the course of the game through rotation or shifts.

Discussion
In this Map Deformation mechanism, the map is traditionally composed of
a series of (typically square) tiles, composed of smaller spaces. Player tokens
are located on these tiles. When the tiles are rotated or relocated, the player
tokens are moved along with them.
Because this can often radically change the game situation, this mechanism
introduces a large dose of chaos into the proceedings. It can also make it
difficult for certain players who may have spatial relation issues to visualize
the result of the deformation. This is particularly true as tiles with more spaces
on them are used.
This mechanism can be implemented through means other than tiles. In
Stay Alive players move sliders around the edge of the board to control where
holes are located, possibly dropping marbles out of the game. In both Dune
and Yedo, an entire section of the board is blocked each turn by the sandstorm
and watchman, respectively.
Because of the impact of Map Deformation, it is typically the centerpiece
of the game, and not a secondary mechanism.

Move Through Deck

Description
Players Move Through a Deck of cards.

Discussion
This mechanism gives players the feeling of movement by forcing them to
work through a deck to get to the bottom, or some goal card. In Chainsaw
Warrior, for example, the deck thematically represents the house players are
exploring, with cards representing rooms or encounters, and players take
“move” actions to delve deeper.
This mechanism is also used in Incan Gold, where players flip cards to move
deeper into the temple.
Adopting this metaphor allows designers to give players a sense of forward
momentum while keeping the game compact, eliminating the need for a
board or large map. It also makes it easier to randomize. The Gating and
Unlocking mechanism (ACT-15) is good to use here to tier difficulty.

Movement Template

Description
A defined Movement Template is used to determine where a piece moves to.

Discussion
First pioneered in Wings of War, this system has been widely used since,
most notably in the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game. Each turn, players
simultaneously select which Movement Template will be used by each of their
units. For example, it may be a Short Straight, a Gradual Left, or a Sharp
Right. Moves are revealed, and the templates are used to determine where
each piece will end.
Because of the use of the templates, this mechanism is best thematically
integrated with pieces that need to keep moving, such as airplanes.
These games are similar to Programmed Movement (MOV-10), except
that only one move is programmed, as opposed to the 3–5 that are common
in traditional Programmed Movement games. These systems also typically
do not have a board or spaces to regulate movement but are played directly
on a table top. While this introduces some of the analog issues discussed

Movement

391

in Measurement, the use of the templates keeps things better constrained.
However, rules for collisions also need to be developed.
The use of templates also allows for unit differentiation by defining which
templates may be available to them.
Lazer Ryderz introduces a variation on the system by incorporating an
Action Retrieval system (ACT-03) for when players are allowed to reuse
certain templates.
A related system, included here for brevity, is Diskwars, where the units are
discs. They are moved by flipping a certain number of times. The diameter
of the disc and the number of times it may be flipped define the speed. In
essence, the discs themselves are serving as the Movement Templates.

Pieces as Map

Description
The Pieces themselves compose the Map.

Discussion
These games blur the line between Units and Map, as the map is composed
of the individual units themselves. Because of this, these games are typically
played directly on the table surface without a board.
The two exemplar games for this mechanism, Hive and Vortex, use
hexagonal tiles for units. Hexagons are a natural choice for this mechanism,
as it gives more options for pieces to move.
Typically pieces must be adjacent to other pieces, so there is one single
connected block of units. Pieces are added to the other edge, or moved around
the outside. Pieces that are surrounded by others are usually locked in place,
with only those on the outside of the block able to reposition.
Units may have intrinsic abilities (as in Hive) or gain special abilities based
on adjacent tiles (Vortex).
Because all the pieces, both friendly and enemy, are in a connected block,
these games are typically highly interactive, tactical, and quick.

Multiple Maps

Description
The game takes place on Multiple Maps which are connected at defined
points.

Discussion
This mechanism is implemented in Iron Dragon, a rail game set in a fantasy
world. Trains may run through the main board, or transition to a special
Underground map. The two are connected at specific points, which can make
for interesting route building.
Khronos has multiple boards, but these are connected in time rather than
space. They represent three different ages of the same region, and actions that
are taken on older boards, like building structures, can ripple through into
the future boards.
Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is a trading game that may be played by up to
15 players on three maps placed at separate places in the room. Each board is
played individually—turns are not synced between boards—and players may
move from board to board under certain circumstances, taking their goods
with them in an attempt to make better deals. When arriving at a new board,
they are inserted into the turn order. Players move around each map visiting
individual stores for buying and selling, and prices fluctuate independently.
Having Multiple Maps forces players to approach the geometry of the
situation in a different way. It may present shortcuts or advantages that need

Movement

to be evaluated in the context of the cost to take advantage of them. It also
allows the designers to create more complex structures.

Shortcuts

Description
A shorter or quicker route exists that may not always be available.

Discussion
Shortcuts are a way for designers to warp the geometry of the board, to
give players other options. For example, in Clue, players may move directly
between the diagonal corners of the board. This system reduces travel time,
which is not a core feature of Clue.
Sometimes, shortcuts are only usable by certain characters, or with certain
equipment. This is commonly used in dungeon-crawl type games, through
the Secret Passage trope. Characters may need to use a skill to detect and be
able to use them or need a special key.
Some games will have alternate paths that are shorter, but more treacherous.
This is a way to present tactical options to players in what is traditionally a
basic Roll and Move format (MOV-02).

Hidden Movement

Description
Movement occurs that is not visible to all players.

Discussion
Hidden Movement is closely tied to many of the mechanisms discussed
in Chapter 6, “Uncertainty,” but there are specific considerations that are
reviewed here.
Scotland Yard is a classic example of a game with Hidden Movement.
One player, Mr. X, is trying to evade the other players for a set number of
turns. Hidden Movement games require the hidden players to track their
location somehow, and in Scotland Yard it is done by recording it on a pad.
This method is commonly used in these games, as it also allows for the
players to review the hidden players’ locations after the game is complete,
both for the fun of seeing “close calls” as well as ensuring that the rules
were followed.
This last item deserves to be emphasized. By its nature, Hidden Movement
requires actions to be taken without knowledge of the other players. So,
typically the rules relating to this activity should be as simple as possible.
In Scotland Yard, Mr. X uses Point-to-Point movement, (discussed in
Tessellation MOV-01) to move around the map, using different forms of
transportation. The connections between the points are color-coded to
match the transportation options, making it relatively simple to understand,

398

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

and hopefully avoid mistakes. An error in a Hidden Movement game often
cannot be found until after the game is over and can invalidate the entire
experience.
There are games that have more complex movement and rules in general
in order to support a specific play experience. The Normandy Campaign is the
first entry in the Double Blind trilogy. In these war games, each player has
a map of the play area, and keeps it hidden from the other behind a screen.
The front line is represented by a chain of tokens. Any movement of pieces
behind the front line (friendly territory) is not revealed to the other player.
If a player wishes to move into enemy territory, they announce the numbers
of the spaces they moving into, one at a time. If there are enemy forces in a
space, the movement is stopped, and combat is resolved. Then the front line
is adjusted, as spaces that are moved through transfer ownership. This series
obviously requires that both players be very familiar with the rules and uses
an honor system for following rules.
The game Flat Top simulates carrier battles in World War II, and both
players use Hidden Movement on private boards to track the location of their
naval task forces to try to find the enemy players launch search planes on
the main board. However, since simply placing search planes launched from
carriers directly onto the board would reveal the carrier locations, players are
allowed to use Hidden Movement for search planes until they want to reveal
them on the main board. They can’t search until they are revealed, but they
can move to a different location far enough from their carrier to try to mislead
the opponent about their origin point.
Since deception and deduction are typically part of the Hidden Movement
experience, most of these games have defined points or reasons when players
must reveal their location. Scotland Yard requires the player to surface on
certain turns. Specter Ops requires the hidden player to commit crimes at
certain locations, which reveal their location, as does moving in Line of Sight
of a hunter (ARC-08).
Another option for giving hints is used in Captain Sonar. In this game,
each team announces what direction it is moving in (e.g., North or West).
The other team records this information, and since subs cannot move through
islands or off the map, can gradually figure out where the opponent is located.
The Fury of Dracula gives time-delayed hints to the hunters using an Action
Queue system (ACT-06). Dracula plays a card showing the location he is
moving to, but that card is added to a queue. Only the last card in the queue
may be looked at by the hunters, so they see where Dracula was a few turns
ago, but not where he currently is. This has the benefit of not requiring any

Movement

399

note-taking by the player conducting the Hidden Movement and helps detect
rule violations.
Pyramid of Pengqueen offers a unique approach to detecting hidden
locations. Players place magnetized pieces on either side of a vertical center
wall. When two pieces are on the same space, they repel and fall off of the
wall.
Another way to implement Hidden Movement is what we call the Anchor/
Distance mechanism. In this, the unit that is moving is revealed in a specific
location. Then each turn, or as a result of an action, it moves one further
away from that space, increasing the Distance. However, the exact location
is not recorded or determined in any way. At some point, the movement is
completed or the unit is revealed. At that time, it is placed on the map a
number of spaces away from the Anchor space determined by the Distance.
This system is used by War of the Ring. The Fellowship hides, and then each
time it takes a Move action the Distance is increased by one on a movement
track. The opponent (Sauron) may try to hunt and reveal the location of the
Fellowship, or the Fellowship may declare its position voluntarily. When it
is revealed, the Fellowship figure is moved on the map from its last known
location to any space that is the Distance away from the starting location.
The specific movement of the Fellowship must them be traced, and if the
Fellowship traces its path through certain regions, like an enemy-controlled
stronghold, consequences like taking increased corruption or damage will
follow. In other words, on a turn-by-turn basis, the Fellowship’s exact
location is undetermined. Interactions with the Fellowship are tied to its last
known location, but an interaction which reveals the Fellowship also forces a
declaration of its last few turns of movement. One important consequence of
this system is that paper tracking of the Fellowship is not required, and the
experience is far less susceptible to human error.
In 4000 ad fleets move by “warping” from one location to another. This is
done by placing them into a plastic tray and recording where it starts. Then
each turn it is advanced along the distance track, until the player decides to
leave warp. At this point, the fleet may be placed anywhere that is the current
distance from the origin.

Area Control

ӶӶ
Wargaming is a thread that runs through much of boardgame design, and
indeed, modeling conflicts through games remains a popular genre. At the
center of games of conflict is the notion of controlling an area.
How a game represents this idea is tied to the overall scope of the conflict
depicted. Theater-level games that deal with continents and countries tend to
be more binary and abstract about control, while individual and squad-level
games may not even define it, though the force-projection capabilities of units
will nonetheless enforce control over different parts of the board.
Area control games are more common in the American design school,
but over time, European designers have brought indirect conflict and rapid
resolution concepts into the space.
The term area majority is sometimes used in place of area control, and
another term, area influence, is also used. There isn’t a reliable definition for
any of these terms. But here’s one way to think of them: Area Influence is the
highest-level category, which would cover all types of relationships between
players, their tokens, and the specific areas they inhabit. Area Majority and
Area Control would be two sub-branches of Area Influence. In practice,
however, Area Majority and Area Control are the dominant mechanical
forms we observe in games, and the distinction between the two is often
ignored. Thus, we’ve chosen the name Area Control to stand for all the various
mechanisms of control and influence that we’ll discuss.
Many of the mechanisms discussed here are a subset of Chapter 10,
“Movement.” However their use is specialized and common enough to
warrant a chapter of their own.

Absolute Control

Description
One player has Absolute Control of an area.

Discussion
Absolute Control games, which are frequently referred to as Area Control
games, have territories with a binary character: controlled by a single player,
or uncontrolled. Controlled territories typically only contain one player’s
units, and other players are barred from co-existing in that territory. This
type of control can be seen in Risk, where attempting to move into enemyoccupied territories triggers a battle. This is as distinct from games like Chess
or Onitama, where a piece might project force across other spaces, but can
never protect the space it occupies itself, and is simply captured when another
piece enters its space. This is further distinct from games in which multiple
factions can share a territory without triggering a confrontation, like Root.
This observation leads us to another element of area more generally,
which is that it’s important to know who controls the space, because the
space occupied provides benefits, gives access to certain abilities, or produces
resources. The reason to occupy the space is not simply tactical and positional.
In Axis & Allies, spaces produce industrial production credits that can be used
to buy new units. In Small World, territories may have different features like
hills or mines, which may trigger specific effects or abilities, including bonus
scoring.

Area Control

403

Many games allow players to control a territory even though they have
evacuated the units within it. Typically these are marked with a “control
token” or something similar to indicate ownership of the area, like Axis &
Allies. However, some games, like Diplomacy, do not do this, but rely on the
players to remember which spaces are controlled. In Diplomacy this is not
much of a hardship because control only matters to special Supply Center
spaces, and there are few of those. The last player to control a non-Supply
Center space has no impact on the game.
Another consideration is how areas change control. The most common is
occupation by units. However, some games allow control to transfer without
units, such as through diplomacy actions in Pax Britannica and Divine Right.
In the latter, neutral countries (composed of many spaces) may be persuaded
to join a player’s side, in which case all the areas pass to the control of that
player. Similarly they can revert to neutral status or control of another player.
Diplomacy only allows Supply Centers to change control every second turn,
which gives players more time and space to maneuver.

Area Majority/Influence

Description
Multiple players may occupy a space and gain benefits based on their
proportional presence in the space.

Discussion
An elegant example of European design sensibilities applied to American-style
conflict games is the area majority mechanism of El Grande. Each province
is worth a different number of Victory Points (VPs) that will be awarded to
the player with the most caballeros (soldiers) present in the province. Points
are also awarded to the players with the 2nd- and 3rd-most caballeros in the
region. Caballeros do not directly interact, and there is no conflict resolution
mechanism of any kind. Instead, the game implements a Multiple-Lot
simultaneous Auction (AUC-11) themed as a conflict game. The game is
not won with tactical brilliance or a lucky streak of die-rolling, but through
efficiency in winning auctions for VPs.
This idea of efficiency is clearer in an even older game from the late
nineteenth century, Reversi. In Reversi, both players will, in turn, play 32
double-sided tokens to the board, flipping tokens of their opponent’s color
when they lie in an orthogonal or diagonal line between the newly placed
token and one or more anchoring tokens. The game is only scored after all
tokens are laid down, with the player controlling the majority of the 64 spaces
on the board being the victor. One could similarly envision Go as an area

Area Control

405

majority game, though it is strategically more of an area Enclosure game
(RES-12).
In Twilight Struggle, players must not only have a majority of influence
in a country in order to obtain control, they must have an edge over their
opponent equal to the country’s stability number. Stable countries with
dependable governments, like Japan, have a stability number of 4, while wartorn, weaker nations who were pawns in the global contest, like Lebanon,
have a stability number of 1. Controlling a country grants a few benefits,
including doubling the cost of your opponent adding influence to the country
through normal operations. However, being on the short end of that influence
battle isn’t all bad. As long as you had presence in the country, you could
spread influence to adjacent countries. This is a good example of how different
levels of presence and domination of an area can offer different tactical and
strategic advantages.
The notable distinction of Area Majority games is that troops of opposing
factions can co-exist in the same territory. In Inis, not only can opposing
clansmen co-exist in the same space, there is even a victory condition which
calls for sharing spaces with factions in six different territories. Relatedly, the
combat mechanism of Inis allows for players to participate in a round or two
of combat, and then mutually agree to stop fighting, without withdrawing
any troops.
Civilization also allows for units from multiple players to co-exist in the
same space, as long as the total number of tokens does not exceed the food
value. If it does, conflict occurs, but there is ample opportunity for peaceful
co-occupation. Unlike Twilight Struggle and El Grande, there is no inherent
benefit from having more tokens in a space in Civilization, unless combat
breaks out. But it can serve as a base from which to expand.
While some games allow a fluidity to the states of control a territory may
exhibit, other games have moments where control must crystallize, and
resolve in some way. While turn-based approaches are common, in which
scoring happens at the end of the round, or at the end of some specific rounds,
other games tie triggering resolution to the size of the forces present in the
territory. In Smash Up, each base has a trigger number. Once the sum of
forces played to that base equals or exceeds the trigger number, the base is
scored. Similarly, in Retreat to Darkmoor, the legendary hero attacks a line of
fleeing villains when the sum of the threat values of the villains breaches the
hero’s stability number. In Darkmoor, only those villains surviving the hero’s
attack are placed in the haven, whose victory points they will score based on
majorities at game-end. For more on this topic see Chapter 4, “Resolution.”

406

It is worth noting that in a standard Area Majority game, where rewards
are granted based on the ownership of a space, ties need to be considered by
the designer. Some games use “friendly” ties, where all players tied for first, for
example, receive first-place points. Other use “unfriendly” ties, where players
tied for first are awarded second-place points. Other tie-breaking mechanisms
(RES-18) are possible, such as priority tokens, or simply not allowing players
to create a tie.

Troop Types

Description
To compete for or establish control requires troops, inhabitants, influence,
presence, or some similar metaphor for being in a place. Many games have
a variety of unit types, with different abilities, and sometimes, different
implications for area control.

Discussion
In some games, only certain units can exercise control over a territory. Axis
& Allies requires infantry or armor units to take control of a territory away
from an opponent. Fighter and bomber planes may not even land on newly
captured territory, which can create some interesting decisions for players who
are forced to decide between taking a valuable plane as a casualty of combat in
order to capture a territory, or having the more expendable infantry unit take
the hit, but be left with a plane that is unable to conquer the space. In Kemet,
the powerful monsters and creatures summoned by the power tiles are not
considered units, and cannot even remain on the board if their accompanying
troops are eliminated.
In the context of area majority games, the simplest distinction between
unit types is their power. Some units have a strength of one, others are more
powerful. Dominant Species has both a majority contest, based on total
population of a species, as well as a dominance contest, which is calculated
by evaluating the types of food a species can eat and the quantity of that food
that is available in the hex being scored. A single unit may lose the population
battle, but win the dominance battle. A more straightforward application of
the idea of varying troop strengths is in Belfort, in which Elves and Dwarves

408

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

start at a strength of one, but can be promoted to count for two points of
strength.
The idea of different unit types is another foundational concept in game
design. It is both so old that it’s hard to know where it first began, and is still a
regular feature of modern design. Units can vary in their movement abilities,
combat strength, cost, their ability to perform certain tasks or even to be
placed in certain spaces, and more. Whether we’re dealing with space operas,
like Twilight Imperium and Star Wars: Rebellion or the highly simplified
wargame-like system Command & Colors, we observe a broad variety of unity
types and methods for distinguishing them from one another.
In the context of absolute control, some differences in troop types are tied
to the uncertainty engine that resolves combat. Whether troops roll a die to
hit, or can only be hit by a certain die value, or all the other variations on this
core idea (Chapter 4, “Resolution”), the differences between troops are about
how they influence random outcomes. This is one of the means by which
designers moderate the impacts of output randomness. The types of troops
committed, and the expected value they generate in terms of hits they can
inflict on the opposing side, represent a wager, with the value of the territory
occupied representing the pot to be won.
In an area majority context, there is a narrower range of variation. There
are troops that are worth more than one point of strength, troops whose
value is hidden, troops who can override rules that restrict additional troops
from being added, or troops that provide tie-breaker benefits. Rarely, a unit
might actually eliminate existing units from an opposing player, as the
T-Rex, and Pterodactyl units do in Triassic Terror. In that same game, the
Raptor unit also forces opponents to move units to another territory. Cave
Troll is built entirely around the mechanism of special powers for units
that influence the struggle for majorities in various rooms of a dungeon.
Each player fields units that have abilities such as locking down a room in
the dungeon to prevent other players from adding units there, or swapping
units between rooms. In Glenn Drover’s Empires: Galactic Rebellion (which
is only the latest iteration of a game once published under the Age of Empires
license) a variety of units perform functions either related to, or entirely
additive to, their roles in the majority contest. A Diplomat will let you
bring another unit along to a planet to increase your strength there, while
a Smuggler will let you get trade goods.

Territories and Regions

Description
Maps can exhibit hierarchical relationships among their constituent spaces,
such that a territory might exist in a region, and various attributes and
parameters may be tied to the control of these areas.

Discussion
The concept of Regions constituted out of a number of Territories is common
in conflict games. One typical mechanism provides an additional reward to
players who control a set of Regions that compose a territory. This mechanism,
a kind of territorial Set Collection (Chapter 12) can be implemented based
on absolute control, like Risk, or based on majority control, as in EightMinute Empire: Legends or Twilight Struggle. Setting regional control offers
some natural hooks for designers to hang additional concepts off of. Making
movement between Regions more difficult or expensive enhances defensibility
of a region, once it has been taken. Factions can be assigned “homeland”
benefits when in their own Regions too, as in Risk Legacy. In essence,
regionalizing Territories provides another dimension by which to differentiate
Territories, much as terrain does.
Regional effects provide opportunities to bring a setting to life by providing
narrative and mechanical events that differentiate the Territories from one
another. For Intellectual-Property (IP)-based games like War of the Ring,
regional parameters ensure that iconic moments in the original story can
be recreated with greater fidelity. Strider can only be revealed as Aragorn

Area Control

411

and crowned king if he reaches Minas Tirith or Dol Amoroth. Similarly,
the Corsairs of Umbar can only attack their historically hated enemies,
Gondor, and cannot simply sail to any coastal region. 1960: The Making of
the President’s card-driven system helps the Nixon player carry the West and
the Kennedy player, the Northeast. The contest is decided mostly in the South
and Midwest. Though deviations are possible, the core identity and patterns
of the 1960 election are reinforced by providing different regional strengths
to the Kennedy and Nixon players, baked into the makeup of their unique
decks.

Area Parameters

Description
In Area control games, Parameters are assigned to regions that impact why
players might wish to control them and how they need to allocate resources
to do so.

Discussion
The most common Area Parameters are the rewards gained for controlling
areas. Those could be VPs, which are awarded to the majority owner in El
Grande, or to a single owner in King of Tokyo. Other common rewards include
resources, like in Nexus Ops, and access to special powers, like in Alien Frontiers.
As previously discussed, access to adjacent territories can also be considered a
special ability. Exploration games like The 7th Continent and dungeon crawlers
like Descent: Journeys in the Dark will pile on a variety of parameters onto the
tiles that make up their game boards—though admittedly, this is stretching
the notion of area control extremely thin, particularly in a co-op context.
Memoir ’44 has various bonuses and penalties for attacking and defending
in and out of certain types of terrain, as well as rules modifying movement
for units moving through terrain. It is a good example of the flexibility of
assigning Area Parameters.
Carcassonne extends the notion of Area Parameters by assigning parameters
to different features on each tile. These parameters include point value, and
rules for when and how they can be scored. Though we don’t typically think
of Carcassonne as an area control game, or even a bidding game, both of those

Area Control

413

ideas find expression in its game engine. Placing a pawn takes control, and
represents a wager on the overall value of that feature when (and if!) it finally
scores.
Another important Area Parameter is unit limits. These limits, sometimes
called stacking limits because they defined how many counters could be
stacked on top of one another in hex-and-counter wargames, establish a limit
to the size of armies. Sometimes these limitations are global, as in Heroes
of Land, Air & Sea, which has a 5-unit limit on territories. Other times,
the stacking limit is expressed as a matter of control limits: in Conquest of
the Empire, a general can lead a legion of up to 7 units. Some limits are
enforced based on terrain and unit type. The most common examples are
that naval vessels can’t enter land spaces, and conversely, land units can’t enter
sea spaces. Advanced Squad Leader and other wargames often assign units a
“stacking value,” and each space can hold a maximum stacking total, which
sometimes varies by terrain. Mountainous terrain often restricts mechanized
unit movement, as in Memoir ’44 where only infantry can move through
mountains, but artillery can be emplaced on mountains at setup.
Line of sight is another Area Parameter, but one that is more connected
to how units interact with one another across multiple areas, rather than
being the quality of an area being occupied. We will address it below in the
following section on Force Projection.

Force Projection

Description
Force Projection is the impact of the movement, attack, and other abilities of
units on the decision-making of your opponent.

Discussion
Much of area control revolves around how units can claim and possess areas.
However, achieving that control is a matter of how the various abilities and
powers of units are arrayed and used in combination. Chess is a good example:
in Chess, units occupy their own spaces, but the only relevant parameters tied
to that are that pawn movement into the space is blocked, and bishop, rook,
and queen units are blocked from passing through those spaces, and must
end their movements on capture. Where units are positioned in Chess matters
much for where they project force. A bishop, knight and rook may, from three
different places on the board, train a withering triple attack on an opposing
pawn. Similarly, a powerful queen piece might be harassed and forced off
into a corner because all the spaces she could land on are being threatened by
other units. Famously, a knight against the edge of the board can be corralled
by a bishop in a position exactly three spaces away, orthogonally. In such a
position, every space the knight may move to is threatened by the bishop.
Force projection as a mechanism is strongly tied to Movement (Chapter 10).

Area Control

415

Onitama uses Force Projection almost exclusively. In each game, five random
movement patterns are in play, and cards rotate in and out of the possession
of the players. Skilled players will be able to look ahead several moves and
predict the unfolding of the game board based on where units project force.
Many capture-based abstract games exhibit this quality, from Checkers and
Chess to Elementos to Hive. Photosynthesis has a unique implementation of this
mechanism. Trees don’t project force the way a spearman might. Rather, they
project force based on the size of shadow that they cast. As the sun rotates
around the board, a tall tree will shadow others around it, preventing them
from generating light points for their owners.
Force Projection is not uniquely related to area majority/control games.
Enclosure games like Blokus exhibit this pattern, and auction games have a
similar feeling in the way that each player’s remaining money is a potential
threat in every succeeding auction. The analogy between auctions and area
majority games continues to resonate in this context as well. Force projection
as we use it here is a spatial mechanism. The number of spaces an army can
move, the range of an archer, the area of effect of a wizard’s spell, or a sniper’s
line of sight mechanisms are what we’d call Force Projection mechanisms.

Zone of Control

Description
Spaces adjacent to a unit impact the ability of opposing units to move or
attack.

Discussion
The Zone of Control (ZOC) has been a staple of conflict games since the
1960s. It allows the designer to reduce the unit density and to still allow
players to form lines with gaps that enemies cannot simply move through
without consequence. It is a type of Force Projection (ARC-06), as it allows
a unit to impact other areas of the board.
In the basic ZOC, units must stop when moving adjacent to enemy units,
and are required to attack. Typically all opposing units that are in a ZOC
must be attacked, which can lead to one unit having to attack more than one
opposing piece.
This type of ZOC is sometimes called a Hard ZOC. There are also Soft
ZOCs, where pieces may continue moving after they enter the ZOC but
have to expend more Movement Points (MOV-04). In some games, this is
not permitted, but units that begin in a ZOC may leave the enemy ZOC by

Area Control

417

moving to a non-ZOC space, or may move directly from one ZOC to another,
but must immediately stop.
Some games only assign ZOCs to certain types of units, such as Cavalry
or Skirmishes, or deny it to units in a certain state, like Napoleonic units in
a Square, or unsupplied units.
ZOC can also be created more organically by allowing units to take
opportunity attacks against units that move adjacent to them, or past them,
or that begin a move next to them but move away. While not a ZOC in the
classic sense, it does impose consequences for moving units, and will shape
the battlefield.

Line of Sight

Description
Units may only see certain areas.

Discussion
Many tactical games need to determine if a unit can see another, typically
for purposes of attacking. This is referred to as Line of Sight (LOS). A
variety of mechanisms have been developed to deal with this situation,
with different degrees of accuracy and complexity. LOS is a type of Force
Projection (ARC-06) in that it controls which areas of the board a unit
may impact.
The simplest LOS mechanism is to have a range of a certain number of
spaces, and to trace the shortest path of spaces (hexes or squares, typically) to
the target. If there is any terrain that blocks LOS, the firing unit cannot see
the target. PanzerBlitz uses this method.
There are almost always multiple ways to trace paths from attacker to
target, so typically the attackers may choose which path they prefer. While
this has the benefit of simplicity, it also makes for some unusual situations,
particularly on square grids. Its use is typically restricted to hex grids.

Area Control

419

Games such as Advanced Squad Leader increase realism by having players
lay a thread between the attacker and defender hexes. Dots are placed at
the center of each hex to assist in this. If the thread touches any obstacles
that block LOS, like buildings or forests, the LOS is blocked. The increased
accuracy of this method comes at the cost of fiddliness in terms of moving
pieces out of the way, and adds the possibility of arguments, as the LOS may
just graze certain obstacles and it isn’t totally clear if it is blocked or not.
These systems need to deal with elevation changes as well, to account for
hills, gullies, and multilevel buildings. All of these add both complexity and
realism. Most games use a “layer cake” approach, with pieces being able to
see all spaces on the same elevation as them, and can only see lower levels if
they are on the edge of their elevation (a “crest” hex). Some games even add
rules for blind spots behind obstacles for observers at a height.
In Nuns on the Run, players are trying to avoid the nuns patrolling the
grounds. Movement is Point-to-Point (MOV-01), and LOS is determined by
placing a straight edge between the two points and seeing if it hits any walls.
As a help to players, the spaces are numbered, and the rules include a table
showing if two spaces (looked up by number) can see each other or not. Nuns
on the Run also has facing. Nuns can only see 180 degrees in front of them.
Other games like Advanced Squad Leader do not have facing.
Miniatures games often use a “model’s eye” view to LOS. Players lean
down to the table, and check to see if they can see the opposing models.
Laser pointers can be helpful here in making a determination. Yet, as with
the thread method, this can often lead to player arguments. There may also
need to be judgement about whether some elements of the model don’t count
for LOS. Warhammer Age of Sigmar, for example, specifies that decorative
elements added to a model like flowing capes and large crowns are not valid
for LOS. This allows players to exercise their creativity when painting and
decorating models. Warmachine/Hordes sidesteps this by having players use
standard cylinders to represent models when checking for LOS.
The tactical battle game Tannhäuser takes a simplified approach to LOS.
Spaces on the board are color-coded and grouped into “paths.” Characters on
the same path (same colored circles) can see each other. Some spaces between
paths have two different colors—to represent that they can be seen from any
space in either path.
LOS is a bedeviling aspect of game design. High-level conflict games don’t
require these rules at all, but squad-level combat games usually do, and these
games often have some area control aspects to them. LOS usually interferes
with force projection, so blocking LOS is a tool in the designer’s toolkit for

420

modifying the way in which certain units shape the battlefield and the options
players have for navigating it.

Set Collection

ӶӶ
Humans are pattern-seeking creatures, which perhaps explains why so many
games incorporate some version of set collection. There’s a nearly endless
variety of types of sets to collect. Some sets are thematic, like Noah’s pairs of
animals, or the Three Little Pigs. Some are abstract, like Poker hands or melds
in Gin Rummy, and some sets are arbitrary, like the compass, tablet and gear
science cards in 7 Wonders. Even game concepts like contracts or tickets
can be considered types of set. But no matter their variety and underlying
commonality, all sets are built on the idea of synergy: the value or power of
the set is greater than the sum of its parts.
The result of this characteristic of sets is that as players collect the
components of a set, they will naturally diverge in their valuation of the
remaining components. Picking up the fifth dumpling in Sushi Go! means
much more than the first tempura—but for another player, that tempura
completes their set and scores five points, while the first dumpling is worth
only a single point. This value difference means that inter-player competition is
no longer zero-sum. Players can set and achieve goals that are not in diametric
opposition to their opponents, and the indirect conflicts that result engender
a less aggressive dynamic that can appeal to players who may shy away from
direct conflict.
Set collection can readily support multiple dimensions, and this is
common to all but the simplest of games. Number-based sets can be collected
in numerical order, or in multiples of a single number. Add in colors or suits
for yet another dimension. These orthogonal dimensions create choices and
tension, as players consider which types of suits to collect based on their value,
distribution of their components, and what their opponents might be trying

The rich math behind set collection makes it a great tool for designers,
but just as important for its popularity is the thematic consonance and
intuitiveness of set collection. In Ticket to Ride there’s no imaginable reason
why, at least from a simulation perspective, a set of four blue train cards can
connect Chicago to Omaha, and also Helena to Winnipeg, but not Winnipeg
to Duluth, or Dallas to El Paso. Surely, the actual inputs of labor, capital and
raw materials are similar, and it’s hard to think why, in practice, the blue
tracks are any different from the green ones. And yet, through set collection,
these issues present no challenge to players, their understanding of the game,
and their willingness to accept its conceits. Some tracks are green, and some
are blue. Game on.
That’s the real magic of set collection. It is an incredibly versatile mechanism
for abstracting a whole host of possible game activities. Sometimes, these sets
feel richly thematic and representative of the activities being simulated, and
other times the sets are merely a veneer. But our human love of patterns
and combinations means we’ll accept quite a bit of abstraction in our set
collection. Coupling this activity with clever scoring and collection dynamics
and you have one of the fundamental building blocks of boardgame design.
While set collection can be implemented with many different kinds of
components, by far the most common components are cards and tiles. For
the sake of simplicity, we will refer to set elements generically as cards, unless
referring to a specific game that uses some other component.

Set Valuation

Description
Set Valuation is the logic or underlying mathematical model by which
designers assign values to sets of game elements. Set Valuation can be in
terms of currency, resources, or victory points.

Discussion
To paraphrase Jerry Seinfeld, it’s one thing to collect the set, but something else
entirely to value the set. Many other chapters in this book, like “Economics”
(Chapter 7), “Auctions” (Chapter 8), and “Card Mechanisms” (Chapter 13),
discuss how resources are allocated and acquired, but in this section we’ll
discuss what those resources are actually worth. Implicit in this framing is
that sets are nearly always converted into some benefit and consumed, turned
in, or otherwise removed from play, even if only at game-end. Sets are not
typically semi-persistent: either you make them and spend or score them right

424

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

away, or they persist and are scores at game-end. However, some sets may be
held, and scored when a player chooses to do so for maximal effect.
In the introduction to this chapter, we described sets as being worth more
than the sum of their parts. A more precise way to say that is that sets do not
increase in value in a linear fashion. However, there are many shapes that
the value curve can take, and each of these shapes will incentivize different
behaviors.
The simplest valuation is that set elements are worth nothing on their own,
but the set, when completed, has a value. Ticket to Ride, and its traditional
forebear, Rummy, value sets in this fashion. A card may fit into more than
one set, but on its own it has only potential value—and often, it may be a
wasting asset too. In Ticket to Ride, routes will get claimed over time, and
cards of matching colors therefore decline in their utility. In Rummy, cards left
in your hand at game-end typically count against your score or contribute to
your opponent’s score, depending on the specific variant. This scoring system
creates something of a push-your-luck dynamic as to when to cash in a set
for a reward, and when to hold cards to attempt to increase the set size and
payout.
A less-punishing valuation provides that singleton cards have some basic
value of their own. Cards may also have unequal values, so that there are
more valuable and less valuable cards. Sushi Go! has some cards that are worth
points on their own, but are worth more in a set, like the nigiri cards that have
a point value that can be tripled when paired with a wasabi card.
Another aspect of Set Valuation is termination. Some games define sets
strictly as some number of elements, after which the set terminates. Catan
defines sets in this fashion: you need one wood and one clay to build a road.
No further cards fit into the set in any way, though another set of wood and
clay can build another road segment. Other games offer escalating sets that
terminate, so they have a minimum and maximum valid size, with different
payouts based on the size of the set. A similar mechanism is found In Ethnos,
where bands—sets of the same creatures—are awarded points and allow
markers to be placed on the board for area control (Chapter 11). Bands of six
or more all score the same amount, no matter how large they get, but larger
bands still gain their full on-board placement benefits. In 7 Wonders, there is
no maximum set size or set score for science cards of the same type, beyond
the maximum number of science icons of the same type in the deck.
When sets have a maximum size and/or score, players are incentivized to
diversify and collect multiple types of sets. When sets are not limited, players
are wiser to specialize. However, these base dynamics can be influenced

Set Collection

425

both by the specific valuation curve, and the existence of orthogonal sets.
7 Wonders science scoring is a great example. In 7 Wonders, there are three
types of science cards: tablets, compasses and gears. Cards of the same type
score the number of matching cards raised to the power of two, which is a
sharply accelerating scoring curve that incentivizes collecting only one kind of
science. However, the orthogonal set—that is, one of each type of science—
offers a counter-balance. A set of three compass cards is worth nine points
(three to the power of two), but a set of one of each science type is worth a
base of 1 point per card, and a set bonus of seven, for a total of ten points—
actually outscoring the geometrically increasing set of the same size. Only
when the monotype set has four cards does it begin to outscore diversity sets,
sixteen points to thirteen. Players leaning into a science strategy should seek to
specialize, but the most efficient scoring for three cards is a diversity set. These
varying incentives create interesting decisions and behavior patterns at the
table—even aside from all the other types of sets and scoring in 7 Wonders.
When sets can increase in size and value, a designer can use a variety
of progressions to score increasingly larger sets. We had discussed squaring,
which is one common progression that accelerates sharply, and is most useful
either for smaller sets, or for creating a shoot-the-moon or push-your-luck
dynamic, where a single large set can overwhelm other scoring strategies.
However, designers have overwhelmingly opted for a different sequence when
trying to preserve greater balance among options: triangular numbers.
The triangular sequence, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, etc. has achieved nearly the
status of a mantra or a koan among game designers. It is featured in an
enormous number of games and proves incredibly versatile at providing
escalating rewards for larger sets without overly incentivizing specialization
to the exclusion of all other strategies. Triangular scoring also has a strongly
intuitive property, which is that the second member of the set increases your
marginal score by two points, the third increases that score by three, and so
forth. If you’re playing a game with triangular scoring and you’re wondering
how many additional points you’ll score by adding the nth card to your set,
the answer is n.
Not all scoring progressions slope up. Terminating sets are the most extreme
example, but there are other possibilities too. In Cacao players can move up
a field-watering track. The track spaces are marked −10, −4, −1, 0, 2, 4, 7,
11, 16. Setting the track to start negative is mathematically uninteresting on
its own. Instead, we will calculate the difference between values, which is to
say, what is the actual point gain as you move from space to space. In this
progression, the increase is 6, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5. As you can see, the first half

426

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

is a declining sequence that scores well initially but yields sharply diminishing
returns. The second half is a rising triangular sequence (you may notice that
the 2, 4, 7, 11, 16 is our familiar 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, but with one added to each
number). The marginal returns are highest at the beginning and the end of the
curve, and the middle of the curve is least valuable. Players are incentivized
to either water a little, or a lot, but not a middling amount. This incentive is
similar to the one in Animals On Board, in which players score a few points for
singleton animals on their arks, and score maximum values for sets of three
or more, but don’t score anything for sets of two, which must be surrendered
to Noah, who evidently holds the patent on pairing animals up.

Tile-Laying

Description
Set-collection mechanisms with spatial elements. There are other aspects to
Tile-Laying games like Area-Majority scoring (ARC-02) that we won’t cover
in this section.

Discussion
Tile-Laying is typically thought of as its own mechanism or family of
mechanisms, and that perspective is reasonable. As we examine the patterns
and relationships underlying Tile-Laying, set-collection emerges as one of the
foundational mechanisms of the genre, hence its inclusion in this chapter.
Carcassonne’s city-completion scoring demonstrates the point: a completed
city, which is a set of tiles arranged in a specific way, scores higher than the
sum of the value of each tile. Tile-Laying introduces ideas of adjacency and

428

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

spatial relationships to sets, either as new requirements for set validity, or as
buffs and nerfs to the valuation of sets.
At its simplest, tile-matching of some kind defines whether a tile may be
played at all. In Kingdomino, players must match at least one end of the domino
played to one on the table in order to make a valid play. The actual value of the
tiles is determined based on a secondary mechanism of accumulating crown
tiles. Latice requires that a tile match all of its neighbors by sharing a color or
an animal type. Tiles played to match multiple tiles at the same time earn a
player extra turns, a scoring mechanism, since the first player to lay all their
tiles wins. Each of these plays is a set-completing play.
Qwirkle requires players to place tiles such that they match either the color
or shape (but not both) of the other tiles in their row or column. Players are, in
essence, forming sets of either shapes or colors in a line. Völuspá has a variety
of tiles, and each has its own placement and scoring mechanisms, often with
set collection features. For example, Fenris tiles are more powerful if in a line
with other Fenris tiles, and no tiles may be placed adjacent to Troll tiles.
Alhambra has a light touch on tile placement, but incentivizes players
through other means. Tile edges can either have walls or be open. Wall edges
may only be placed next to walls, and open to open, but otherwise players are
free to place tiles as desired. However, a bonus is given to the player who has
the longest continuous wall running around the outside edge of their tiles,
which can force players going for this bonus to change their valuation of
certain tiles. Otherwise, Alhambra uses a basic area-majority system.
Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King employs a large variety of possible
sets that can be scored across the tiles that players collect. Some involve
adjacencies, others look for region completion, while others are indifferent
to spatial layouts. Some sets only score if they are the largest, a kind of
Area-Majority concept (ARC-02) that is not uncommon to Tile-Laying
games.
The idea of sets scoring regardless of spatial relationships, what we might
call a global presence mechanism, is very common. Suburbia features buildings
whose powers trigger or pay off based on adjacent tiles in some cases, and on
tiles in a player’s city, or even in other players’ cities. Between Two Cities and
Quadropolis offer similar set-scoring rules for tiles of various kinds, based on
their spatial relationships to themselves, or to other tile types. Another type
of set, an enclosing set, can be seen in Rome: City of Marble. Sets of tiles score
based on enclosing and completing a hexagon, and the specific combination
of colors, the flavor of the set, determines how well it scores, with sets of a

Set Collection

429

single color scoring best. The aforementioned Alhambra allows players to score
for same-color tile sets, regardless of their adjacency.

Grid Coverage

Description
A family of mechanisms in which players cover a grid or fill a space using a
variety of shapes.

Discussion
There’s a rich mathematical background to how different shapes can fill a
two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional volume, and as a result, many
games that operate on this basic framework. Undoubtedly, many of these
aren’t really set-collection games, but many are. In Patchwork, players are
trying to acquire the set of tiles that will allow them to fully tessellate their
9 × 9 grids. Tiles have a calculable valuation: each tile covers some number
of spaces, and each uncovered space is −2 Victory Points (VPs). Tiles may
also feature buttons, which are worth 1 VP per payout space that will be
activated. However, simply adding up these values doesn’t give the true value
of the tile, because how well it fits on the board, and which other pieces it
allows to still be placed is crucially important too. In this manner, the game
is a set-collection game: the value of the tiles is greater than the sum of the
parts.
The Princes of Florence has a similar mechanism, with players acquiring
differently shaped tiles to fit into their palazzos. Since pieces can’t be moved
once placed, players are forced to plan ahead. It also changes the valuation

Set Collection

431

of tiles for different players, as some shapes will be more valuable for certain
players.
In A Feast for Odin, various-shaped goods and treasures are added to grids
to try to cover as many spaces as possible. The way the tiles are laid also
determines income, VPs, and bonuses. All are mediated through a variety
of grids. Grid-Coverage games sometimes take advantage of the underlying
grid itself to create another dimension of value. In Bärenpark, players lay
polyominoes on top of icons in a grid made of a series of square tiles. These
icons allow players to draw tiles of different sizes, shapes and point values for
future play. In addition, players are incentivized to fully cover each square grid
tile sooner rather than later, since the value of completing a grid tile declines
after each player completes one.
Admittedly, Grid-Coverage games don’t always involve set-collection in
any recognizable way, like Blokus and Ubongo. Ubongo is strictly a speedpuzzle game, where players are trying to solve Grid-Coverage puzzles using
standard tiles faster than their opponents. Blokus has a placement rule that
restricts where pieces may be placed: pieces of the same color may only touch
at corners. Similar placement restriction rules underlie many spatial games.
There may be other lenses through which to consider these games, like Area
Majority/Influence (ARC-02).
Other examples of games about packing shapes into a defined space
include Pack & Stack and You Need Drew’s Truck. In these games, players
are trying to pack Tetris-style pieces into trucks as efficiently as possible.
FITS, Brikks, and Rolltris are more obviously based on Tetris, as players
attempt to organize pieces that “drop” from the top edge of the grid.
While typically leaving spaces uncovered is bad, FITS has special bonus
spaces that score more when left open, similar to bonuses in A Feast for
Odin.
NBMR9 extends Grid Coverage into three dimensions. Tiles are worth
more as they are stacked on top of other tiles, but they may only be stacked
if they are fully supported with no overhang.

Set Collection

SET-04

433

Network Building

Description
Network Building is a specialized kind of set collection in which the sets
collected represent ties between nodes, often represented as routes between
destinations.

Discussion
Earlier in this chapter, we discussed Ticket to Ride as having a basic Rummylike set-collection mechanism that allows players to build routes in specific
places based on the color and number of train cards they collected. But there’s
another dimension, another kind of set that players collect in Ticket to Ride:
the eponymous tickets themselves. A ticket can be satisfied by an enormous
number of possible route combinations, or sets, that connect the two cities
listed. The tickets represent a set of sets, or a super-set, a kind of telescoping
set of set-collection mechanisms. Brass offers a similar concept in that not only
are players seeking to connect certain cities, they are also seeking to ensure the
availability of certain raw materials within the network created.

434

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Considering sets in this way illuminates the issue of set element exclusivity.
While some games require each set element to be part of only one set, (like
in SET, the pattern recognition game) route-building games typically make
routes permanent, and allow those routes to be reused as part of other sets,
or to be subsumed entirely into a larger set. The visual representation of the
set as nodes and ties makes it really easy for players to understand why this
mechanism works the way it does.
Route-building games have many other elements to them beyond set
collection. Blocking other players, dealing with different types of terrain,
and upgrading the vehicles that run on these routes are just a few of these
elements. We will look at a few of those next. Yet, underneath all of that
is the core notion that by linking together a few nodes into a contiguous
relationship, you create a whole that is more valuable than the sum of its
parts.
There are several options available to the designer in terms of how the
network is created. The three most commonly used are Point-to-Point, Tile
Placement, and Existing Network. In a Point-to-Point system, the map is a
regular grid of dots or connections, and players may connect any two adjacent
dots. Examples of this are Empire Builder, where the connections are drawn
with markers on a dry-erase surface, and Transamerica, where players place
wooden sticks to connect dots, similar to roads in Catan. Point-to-Point
connections can either be owned by a particular player (Empire Builder,
Catan), or be neutral and usable by all (Transamerica).
In Tile Placement systems, players place (typically) square or hexagonal tiles
onto a grid to form connections. Streetcar and Tsuro use square tiles, while
Age of Steam and 1830 use hexagons. The requirement to form connections as
tiles are placed can act as constraints on which tiles may be placed, as in TileLaying (SET-02), as edges need to match up. Tile Placement games allow for
more complex tiles, including connections that go under or over each other,
or branch off. It also allows for Upgrade systems (ECO-11), where tiles are
replaced with more complex or valuable tiles. This is particularly used in rail
games like 1830.
The boards in Existing Network systems have the routes already printed
on them. Players need to claim, construct, or activate them in some way. For
example, in Ticket To Ride, all the possible rail lines are on the map, but need
to be claimed by players through the playing of sets of cars. In Rail Baron and
Power Grid, players pay to control connections.
Point-to-Point systems work well when there are a lot of possible
connections players may want to make. The random cities that need to

Set Collection

435

be connected in Transamerica, or the wide variety of pick-up-and-deliver
locations in Empire Builder make them well suited to give players ultimate
flexibility on how to build their network. However, if there are stereotypical
connections that are always made, an Existing Network system may
work better. In Power Grid ’s original incarnation as Funkenshlag, players
drew power lines on the board with markers. However, build patterns
were pretty standard, so when the game was released again, the switch
was made to an Existing Network system, which earned a much better
reception by players.
Network-Building mechanisms tend to dominate gameplay. Most games
that use them do so as a centerpiece of the design. However, there are some
games where the network construction is a side-show in the main game.
One example is the investigative game Android, where players may make
connections between entities on a separate Conspiracy board which can give
bonuses and impact victory points.
Because of the tactile nature of building networks, a variety of
other physical media have been used besides those mentioned. Some
examples include Twixt, which uses an ingenious peg-and-link system,
String Railway, where players lay string on the table to represent rail lines,
and Paperclip Railways, which does something similar with paper clips,
except that clips can be added to chains to represent additional rails being
built.

Combo Abilities

Description
A collection of Abilities that are acquired separately and synergize together.

Discussion
Earlier, in Set Valuation (SET-01), we discussed using sets as resources or as
direct point-scoring elements. Here, we focus on sets as game verbs and adverbs,
as elements that provide actions (verbs) or buffs (adverbs) to actions.
Combos are an emergent aspect of gameplay, in that they aren’t explicitly
explained in the rules, even though effective play usually requires finding
strong Combos. For designers who wish to cultivate this kind of play in their
games, there are some best practices to follow.
Games with Combo potential usually have a modular, black-box approach
to actions, which tend to be direct and non-contingent. It also helps to have a
few types of resources, and a variety of domains within which game elements

438

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

can exist. Finally, more open turn structures, with more options for how to
play help create a Combo dynamic. Card games like Seasons illustrate this
well. Cards can exist in a deck, a hand, or in play. Actions that move cards
from deck to hand create a chain that allows another play. Resources that can
be converted into effects, or more resources, create the possibility of virtuous
spirals. And the existence of dice opens up a whole dimension of possibilities
for altering die-faces and rerolling dice.
Combos exist in many games, perhaps most famously in Magic: The
Gathering. However, when played in constructed formats, where players build
their own decks before play, the set collection aspect of the game exists largely
in the purchasing of cards. In draft formats, however, players who can identify
and select synergistic cards are in essence defining and collecting sets. What
makes this type of set collection different from the set collection of a game like
Coloretto is that the sets in Magic: The Gathering are not predefined or fixed.
While the designers have certainly intended many of the powerful effects of
certain card combinations, by not explicitly declaring these combinations as
sets, they preserve the joy of discovery for players.
In Kemet, acquiring tiles that enhance your movement ability can synergize
with a tile that forces your opponent to take casualties before a battle
commences. Together, these two Abilities make for a potent combination that
allows you to project force across the board. Kemet has many other synergies
hiding among the power tiles that players can acquire.
Many games have these kinds of Combos, and identifying and assembling
a Combo and then running it is the core of the gameplay. Many so-called
engine-building games are precisely this: getting together a few elements
that create a virtuous cycle of increasing productivity. Some games have you
building actual engines, like Steampunk Rally, while in others, the engine is
more metaphoric, like the combinations of Abilities and scoring that you can
build in Race for the Galaxy. In Orléans, a specific set of workers is required to
trigger taking an action. The 7th Continent has a crafting system that allows
players to combine cards, and Evolution features a similar system to provide
creatures with traits, and even to create multiple species with complementary
Abilities that model symbiotic biological relationships. Glory to Rome and its
spiritual successor, Mottainai, can best be described as games that challenge
players to assemble a set of cards that add up to a game-breaking Combo.
We’ll end by reflecting that set collection is a dynamic, a pattern common
to many games that is instantiated by a number of mechanisms, including
those that define acquisition, usage, and valuation. Like with Auctions
(Chapter 8), at some point we begin to observe set-collection elements within

Set Collection

439

nearly every game. That observation, though interesting, may not be useful
to the working designer. Set collection as a concept may be everywhere, but
set collection as a mechanism exists in fewer places.

Card Mechanisms

ӶӶ
Card games go back to the first millennium CE, possibly as early as the 800s
in China, and by 1400, variations on the now-familiar 4-suit, 52-card deck
are attested to in Persia, the Middle East, and Europe. All of this is to say
that card games and their attendant mechanisms have been around for a long,
long time.
Core concepts in card games include a face-down draw deck from which
players can draw cards privately into a hand; the public table where all players
can see and interact with cards; the tableau, a private, but visible play area;
and the discard pile, which has varying rules for interaction. The various types
of runs and sets, predicated on the ranks and suits of cards, have different
implications for different games, as does the existence of “joker” or wild cards
in a variety of flavors.
Overall goals of card games might include shedding cards from a hand,
capturing or avoiding specific cards, collecting a larger number of cards than
the opponent, winning a specified number of hands, defeating attacks from
other players, and aligning outcomes to bids. Card games have rules about
hand limits, how cards may be acquired, used, and discarded, how turn order
may be manipulated, and what the specific composition of cards in the deck
must be.
Broadly, we can speak of trick-taking games, shedding games, and handcomparison games, though there is substantial hybridization. Trick-taking
games focus on card comparison in card-by-card and turn-by-turn play, often
tied to some contract or bid that players seek to make. Shedding games are
games in which players seek to get rid of their cards first, like in Rummy-style
games. Ladder-climbing games, a hybrid type, are a combination of tricktaking games and shedding games that are especially popular. Players shed
441

442

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

their hands by laying down a valid set, like in Rummy, but compete for the
right to lead a new ladder by playing the highest-ranked cards of that set.
Hand-comparison games often involve betting, like Poker and Blackjack, where
players compare hands based on some standard ranking of hands. The action
in these games is in acquiring the set, rather than grouping an existing hand
into a few sets and playing them out.
Modern card games sometimes follow these models fairly closely. There
are many Rummy, trick-taking, climbing, and even Poker variants, from the
Mystery Rummy series to Tichu to Pyramid Poker. However, there is a new
school of modern card games that shares basic ideas about decks and hands
with classic card games, but little about the nature and meaning of the cards
themselves.
It will take a better work of history to properly trace the evolution of
card games and to disentangle the influence of collectible card games from
the emergence of card-based versions of middle-weight European-style board
games. However, modern design embraces cards as flexible game elements
that function almost as rulebook additions. Cards carry a small payload of
additional rules that define how they may be used, while possibly also sharing
broader characteristics like suits, costs, prerequisites, bindings to other game
elements, and more.
We cover many mechanisms throughout this book that are often
implemented with cards, and there’s probably no truly satisfying definition
for the category of card games. Nonetheless, in this section, we’ll explore
some of the major concepts and mechanisms that feature regularly in card
games and games played mostly with cards, that we haven’t already addressed
elsewhere in this volume.

Trick Taking

Description
Players play cards from their hand to the table in a series of rounds, or “tricks”
which are each evaluated separately to determine a winner and to apply other
potential effects.

Discussion
Trick-Taking games are about 1,000 years old, and as such, there many games,
variations and scoring rules. Covering all those possibilities is beyond our
scope, and we will instead focus briefly on the core concepts.
Trick-Taking games begin with dealing cards out. In classic games, like
Bridge and Spades, all cards are dealt out evenly to the players. Some games
have a betting phase in which players declare the number of tricks they intend
to take. After this, players play in turn order, starting with the first player,
called the lead. Many games require that players “follow the lead” or “follow
suit,” which means playing a card of the same suit as the lead, if possible. The
player playing the highest card of the lead suit wins the trick, and becomes the
lead for the next round. Often, one suit is the “trump” suit, and cards of that
suit outrank cards of the lead suit, no matter their numerical value. Finally,
players score for the number of tricks they’ve won.
Designers have created variations of all of these core rules. In Diamonds,
rather than dealing the entire deck, a subset of the deck is dealt out, which

444

creates uncertainty and lowers the impact of memory and card counting. In
Sticheln, players do not have to follow the lead suit, and unlike most games,
where off-suit cards are disregarded when determining the winner of the
trick, here, they are considered trump! In The Bottle Imp, trump isn’t tied to
suit at all. Instead, only a single card may be trump at any given time: the
card closest to, but not exceeding, the value of the bottle, which begins at
19. As lower numbers are played, the bottle takes on the value of those cards.
A related approach is featured in Little Devils, where the second card played
to the trick will set the rule for the trick: if the card is lower, all proceeding
players must play lower, and if it is higher, they must play higher. The game
also features the variation that winning tricks is a negative outcome. Going
back to Sticheln, players want to win tricks, but every round all players choose
a “pain” suit whose cards will count against them, and try to win tricks while
avoiding taking cards from their pain suit.
Betting can also feature variations. In Bridge, for example, the bid for
a contract includes the right to determine which suit will be trump. Only
the team that wins the bidding can score points for making its contract.
Trick-Taking games are often played in partnership, and the bidding phase
will typically have players taking turns bidding, alternating between the two
teams. In some games, like Wizard, the sum total of tricks that players bid
cannot equal the number of tricks in the hand. This guarantees that at least
one player or partnership will miss their bid. Another common variant is the
impact of “over-booking” or “over-tricking,” which is collecting more tricks
than the contract called for. Whether over-booking is more valuable, equal in
value, or less valuable than the tricks contracted for varies from game to game.
In “exact bid” games like Sluff Off, over-tricking may even be penalized.
Trick-Taking games share many features and dynamics with both OnceAround Auction (AUC-07) and Sealed-Bid Auction (AUC-04), as unintuitive
as that may sound. Readers curious about this should study Trick of the Rails,
a card game that models 18xx-style games and uses Trick Taking in place of
auctions. A Trick-Taking game is similar to an auction in that players hold
a hand of currency, and bid that currency to win the trick. The currency
is not consistent in relative value, because the exact same trick might be
won by different cards depending on which card was led, and what suit is
trump. In addition, the lot up for bid—the cards of the trick—is also what’s
being used to bid. This kind of dynamic is how a wager usually works; you
commit money to the pot, hoping to win the pot, which is composed of all
the bids. Trick-Taking games may be described as highly specialized auctions,
at least mathematically speaking. From a game-design perspective, however,

Card Mechanisms

445

Trick-Taking games typically emphasize hand-management and planning
skills, rather than valuation skills, and the experiential difference between a
series of auctions and a hand of tricks is substantial as well.

Ladder Climbing

Description
Players play one card, or a set of related cards. Subsequently, players must
play cards of an equal or higher value of the same set already played. The last
player to successfully play wins the right to start a new round of Climbing.

Discussion
Ladder Climbing games, or simply Climbing games, are closely related to
trick-taking games. The two began to differentiate geographically, with
Western games in Europe developing around winning tricks and trump suits,
and Eastern games in China, Korea, and Japan developing around shedding
hands and playing sets.
The simplest Climbing games, like President (also known as Scum, Bum,
Landlord, and Capitalism among many others), have players playing single
cards, doubles, triples, or quads. Subsequent plays must follow the set, but be
of an equal or higher rank, for example, following three 8s with three 10s.
More complex sets, like in Haggis, include runs, or sequences of consecutive

Card Mechanisms

447

cards, or runs of paired cards. Bombs, unbeatable combinations that can be
played no matter what set preceded them, are another wrinkle in this genre.
Shedding all your cards, also called “going out” is generally a goal in
Climbing games, and in many classic shedding games it is the win condition.
In some games, like The Great Dalmuti, play continues until all but one player
has gone out, and players are ranked in order of going out. Going out isn’t
necessarily the win condition. Some games, like Tichu, reward the player
who goes out first with points for doing so, while also granting points for the
specific contents of tricks won.
Climbing games offer many of the same kinds of variations as trick-taking
games. Bidding, partnerships, and wild cards are all common. Another
popular variation is the pyramidal deck, as in The Great Dalmuti, which
is a deck of ranked cards with a quantity of cards in each rank equal to the
value of the rank. Thus, there are eight 8s, nine 9s, etc. Taking this idea even
further, Custom Heroes introduces plastic cards that are placed in sleeves.
Adding more cards to a sleeve can change the card’s value or introduce special
abilities to the card.

Melding and Splaying

Description
A set of cards in a specific relationship to one another that allows them to
be played to a table or scored is a meld. When laying these cards down, the
way the cards splay, or overlap one another, may sometimes reveal or conceal
certain abilities or attributes.

Discussion
Melds are a kind of Set Collection (Chapter 12) that are very common in card
games. Classic card games typically allow melds of identical cards, sometimes
called a set, or melds containing cards in a fixed series, for example, ascending
by one, usually called a run. Rummikub is one example of a game that includes
both types of melds.
Commonly, players must assemble a meld in their hands and only then
play the melds out onto the table. In Rummy and its many variants, melds
played out on the table can be added to by other players, sometimes called
“laying off ”—but only if they have already played a meld themselves. In
Rummikub, players may disassemble and reassemble any melds on the table, as
they seek to lay off more tiles from their hands into these new arrangements.

Card Mechanisms

449

Splaying is an unusual mechanism that takes advantage of the physicality
of cards. Innovation is probably the best-known game with this mechanism.
A meld, when played, must be splayed in a specific fashion, so that certain
icons on cards will be covered by their neighbor. Later effects may allow
players to splay out further horizontally, revealing another set of icons, or even
splay vertically, revealing icons on the bottom of the cards. In …and then, we
held hands., players must resplay their entire tableau to match their position
on the board: if they are on the left side of the board, they may only see and
use the left side of their tableau, and vice versa. In Lotus, cards are splayed in
sets to look like flowers, which achieves a beautiful visual effect, albeit without
any gameplay effects.
This kind of card overlapping exists in both Honshu and Circle the Wagons,
in which players play cards to construct territories, using the current card to
overlap some of the previous cards. However, there are no mechanisms for
changing how the cards splay once they have been laid down.

CAR-04 Card Draw, Limits
and Deck Exhaustion

Description
Games frequently limit the number of cards that may be held in a given
container, whether that is a hand, a deck, or something else. Similarly, various
game effects trigger when a deck, draw pile, or hand becomes exhausted.

Discussion
Hand Limits are a critical part of the superstructure of a game. Cards represent
options, and the more cards are held in hand, the more choices a player must
consider. In modern games, where cards are not simply members of a set, but
instead provide actions or other benefits, more cards mean more power.
In many games, there is no possibility of card advantage because card
plays and Card Draws are symmetrical and metered. In Diamonds, as in
most trick-taking games, all the cards that will be in play are dealt at the
beginning, and players each play one card per turn. In Mystery Rummy: Jack
the Ripper, as in most Rummy-style games, players draw a card into their hands
at the start of their turns, and discard one card to end their turns. Similarly,
cooperative card games tend to tightly limit card economies because of how
closely coupled those economies are with game difficulty. Forbidden Island,
for example, if played without a hand limit of artifact cards, is a substantially
easier game. Whenever a game involves collecting sets of cards, it will be
easier for players to collect sets when they can draw and keep larger numbers
of cards. Cooperative games can tweak these settings to change the challenge
level presented to the players.
This one-in-one-out static card economy is overturned by many modern
designs, and players routinely have more agency over their draws and discards.

Card Mechanisms

451

In Memoir ’44, scenario-specific rules set the draws, discards and hand limits
for each faction, which allows the designer to model military concepts like
surprise, supply lines and operational capacity. Individual cards, like “Recon,”
allow players to draw additional cards, at the cost of taking a less powerful
action on the map. In Evolution: The Beginning, players always receive the
same number of cards each turn, but they may play as many or as few cards
as they wish, and carry over all their cards from turn to turn. Intentionally or
not, this evokes the idea of punctuated equilibrium, in which long periods of
limited speciation is punctuated by moments of great activity, evolutionarily
speaking.
Ticket to Ride similarly doesn’t encumber players with a hand limit, but
imposes a draw limit of two (one if you draw a face-up wild train from the
display). Players may lay down melds of any size though, so long as a matching
route in size and color is available on the board. Thus, player hand-size
fluctuates throughout the game, and skilled players will consider the potential
moves their opponents can make based on the number of cards in their hands.
Bohnanza requires players to draw, and either plant or trade, a fixed number
of cards from the deck each turn. These cards can then be supplemented by
any number of cards in hand.
Some games treat Card Draw as similar to any other resource. In Deus,
players choose to either play a card or to discard some number of cards.
Players may discard any number of cards, but one discarded card, and its suit,
determines which discard ability is triggered. The discard abilities include
gaining money, resources, buildings, or additional card draws. In Race for the
Galaxy, players must explicitly choose whether to convert goods, represented
by cards, into victory points or additional card draws.
At the other end of the spectrum from this more permissive approach to
card economies is Through the Ages, which sorely restricts card movement
from the market row into hand. Players must spend precious actions to
acquire cards from the market row, and may never exceed their hand
limit—unlike many other games that allow players to temporarily exceed
hand limits and then discard down at the end of the phase or turn. In fact,
Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization has no player-triggered discard
mechanism at all, and taking a card into hand comes with an enormous
opportunity cost. The hand limit is itself determined by a civilization’s
government type, and more advanced governments increase the player’s
hand-size, and thus, fairly directly, the power and possibilities of that
player’s civilization.

Deck Building

Description
Players play cards out of individual decks, seeking to acquire new cards and
to play through their decks iteratively, improving them over time through
card acquisition.

Discussion
Deck Building isn’t a single mechanism, and throughout this book we discuss
mechanisms that are also present in Deck-Building games. Nevertheless,
a core structure has emerged in deck-building games that we’ll consider
here. Though Deck Building is a relatively new mechanism and genre,
having appeared first in 2008’s Dominion, follow-ups have often mimicked
Dominion’s basic structures. The basic idea is that cards can provide actions,
currency for use only in the current turn, or victory points. In base Dominion,
nearly all the cards provide only one of each of these uses, but many deck
builders that followed combined these and offered players a choice for how
to use each card. Some games have also expanded beyond these boundaries,
like the bases that persist in players’ tableaus until they are destroyed in
Star Realms.
In many deck builders, players will dispose of their whole hand of cards
each turn. Commonly, players have a limit on the number of cards they can
play as actions, but no limit on the cards that can be played as money, though
not all cards will have a money value. While Dominion limits the number of
buy actions players can take, most follow-ups limit players to what they can
afford. Some cards allow players to draw, and then play, even more cards. At
the conclusion of their turn, players will draw back to the full hand, usually
five cards. While Dominion provided for a static, open market for cards, later

454

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

deck builders like Ascension: Deckbuilding Game and Star Realms offer players
a market row that is replenished from a randomized deck.
Acquisition methods are a good place to evoke theme, while also
addressing the inherent variability of laying out cards for purchase at random.
Valley of the Kings has a pyramidal market that allows players to buy only
the three cards at the base, after which higher level cards will drop down
into lower levels as the pyramid crumbles. This mechanism gives players
foresight, and a bit of control, over which cards will be available to their
opponents. In Eminent Domain, basic cards are acquired at no cost from a
central display, but powerful tech cards are acquired by being able to play
the requisite number of technology icons. Though there are no dependencies
and prerequisites as in an actual Tech Tree (ACT-16), the effect of making
players show a greater number of technology icons for the more powerful
cards offers a similar scaling effect. The synergies of certain combinations of
cards create more viable and powerful branches through this tiered collection
of technologies.
For readers interested in fully exploring Deck-Building mechanisms,
Dominion’s expansions are an instructive journey. Intrigue introduces negative
player interactions like forced discards. Alchemy introduces a second currency
type, and cards that can only be purchased with that currency. Seaside
introduces the ability to carry over cards from turn to turn. Prosperity adds
treasures, a new kind of resource that can be spent to trigger abilities without
using up actions. Dark Ages focuses on interactions with the discard pile,
while Adventures adds persistent cards that can be played in a future hand.
Cornucopia rewards players for collecting varieties of cards, while Guilds
introduces persistent money and reasons to spend it.
Dominion represents one approach to Deck Building, which is part of a
larger category called pool building, which includes pools built from items
other than cards. This can be entirely isomorphic to Deck Building, as in
Puzzle Strike, in which cards are replaced with custom Poker chips that are
drawn from a bag. The Poker chip component is easier to shuffle as often
as deck builders require, and is more durable when subjected to frequent
shuffling. Orléans, on the other hand, has players drawing workers out of
a bag, who can then be assigned to a variety of actions on a player’s board.
Andy Parks, designer of the deck builder Core Worlds, describes the
distinction between these games as being between drafting verbs, that is,
actions, as in most deck builders, versus drafting nouns, as in Orléans. In a
deck builder like Dominion, most cards represent an action that players can
take simply by playing the card, which is what Parks means by drafting verbs.

Card Mechanisms

455

In Orléans, players pull workers out of a bag and assign them to different
actions. However, actions require some specific combination of worker types
in order to trigger—a kind of Set Collection (Chapter 12)—rather than each
worker type having a specific type of action associated with it. Parks refers to
this as drafting nouns. His own Assault of the Giants game features drafting
adjectives—modifiers that provide bonuses and additional abilities, but that
must attach to existing cards and characters—out of the pool, presenting yet
another possible way to construct a pool builder.
Pools work well as resolution mechanisms, where they’re called chit-pull
systems. There are also games that don’t have true pool-building mechanisms,
but come very close.
In Machi Koro, players purchase numbered cards whose abilities are
triggered based on die rolls. Players can buy cards, representing the pool, and
they can buy cards that trigger on the same numbers, to increase the payouts
of specific numbers. However, players have limited impact on the overall
probability of numbers being rolled. They can choose to roll one die, or two
dice, but that’s all. In a deck builder, players can assure themselves of a zero
probability of not drawing certain cards, simply by not acquiring them. Machi
Koro doesn’t provide quite that level of control to players.
Going farther out on this mechanical limb, we can consider the placement
of settlements in Catan as a pool-building-adjacent mechanism. Even the
selection of runners in Can’t Stop shares something of this flavor. In Roll for
the Galaxy players acquire worker dice that have different faces, and different
values as goods. Players may shape their overall pool both based on which
dice they acquire, but also which dice they place back into their pool each
turn. As deck builders and collectible card games show, there is an enormous
amount of design space outlined by cards and some tokens. In addition to the
games discussed above, cooperative deck builders like Shadowrun: Crossfire,
Gloomhaven, and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game continue to blur the line
between card, board, and role-playing games. There are also variants like
no-shuffle deck builders like Aeon’s End and build-the-enemy’s deck games
like Tiny Epic Defender.

Drafting

Description
Drafting is a means of distributing cards or other game elements to players
through an ordered selection process.

Discussion
Many games can be described as a process of acquiring, manipulating, and
spending resources. One of the main distinctions between modern and classic
card games is the move away from random deals and draws and towards more
agential means of acquiring cards. Auctions are one popular method (Chapter

458

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

8), but they can be cumbersome, mathy, and intimidating to many players.
Drafting represents a quicker alternative. One way to think of a draft is that
instead of precisely valuing each lot and bidding accordingly in an auction,
players can instead ask: What do I want most right now? Do I have to take it
now, or will it be here for me next turn too?
Drafting cards is closely related to Action. Drafting (ACT-02) and Worker
Placement (Chapter 9). The core concept is the same in all of these: players
select, in turn order, something for their exclusive use. What makes card
Drafting different is the variety of design options afforded by the physicality
of the card.
The draft variant most similar to worker placement is the Rochester draft,
as exemplified in The Networks. All available cards are laid on the table, and
players each take one card on their turns. Play continues until all the cards
have been taken, or all players pass their turn. Like a worker placement game,
Rochester drafts make all options visible and available at the same time. This
can be overwhelming for players and can lead to analysis paralysis, just like
in a worker placement game. By physically removing cards from the display,
Rochester drafts simplify visually as the draft continues. Consequently, each
card is also exclusive to the player who selects it, though designers can include
multiple copies of a card if they wish for an action to be available to multiple
players. In addition, for games in which cards are taken in hand and played
in a later phase, Rochester drafts test players’ ability to recall what cards their
opponents took. In a worker placement game, the players’ pawns encode that
information visually, and everyone can see where each pawn was played.
Another simple draft mechanism is pick-and-pass. In Lords of Waterdeep,
a game effect calls for the active player to draw a hand of cards equal to the
number of players at the table, select one to keep, and pass the rest. Each
player does this in turn, until the last player is left with the last card. Some
games call for drawing one more card than the number of players, so the last
player also has a choice. This mechanism is tightly coupled to turn order.
Lords of Waterdeep leverages this coupling to provide the greatest return to the
player who triggered the effect, but designers should take care not to overly
advantage players based on turn order when using this mechanism.
To mitigate turn-order imbalances, designers can implement a snake draft,
in which the order of Drafting in round 1 is inverted in round 2, so that the
last player in the first round becomes the first player in the last round. Snake
Drafting mitigates, but does not resolve, turn-order imbalance. Assuming a
level drop-off in the values of cards, the value of the first choice in round 1
and last choice in round 2 is greater than the value of the last choice in round

Card Mechanisms

459

1 and first choice in round 2. In cases where values don’t drop off in a level
fashion, the problem remains: some positions are superior to others. Games
where the difference in value is negligible, or in which different selections
have different values for each player, may be the best place to implement snake
drafts. Most games will use a snake draft as part of some larger system, or in
setup, as in Catan’s placement of initial settlements.
One game to cleverly address this issue is Kingdomino, in which players
draft dominoes with two terrain squares on them, and add them to their
kingdom. Some squares feature crowns, which make all connected squares
of the same terrain worth one point per crown in the combined region. The
tiles are numbered, with the lowest-numbered tiles being the least valuable.
To draft the tiles, they are laid out in numbered order in a vertical display. The
player who chooses the most valuable tiles, the bottom tile in the display, will
claim that tile, but will go last in the following turn. Conversely, the player
selecting the least-valuable top tile will go first in the next round. While the
tiles have some absolute value, they will differ in relative value to each player
based on the exact terrains featured on them, and what is in each player’s
tableau already. In some cases, a player will gladly take a weaker tile, and its
better place in turn order, because of how well the tile fits in his or her own
board.
Another approach to balancing the turn-order issue of Drafting is to
have parallel pick-and-pass drafts happening simultaneously. This method,
featured in 7 Wonders, Sushi Go!, and Among the Stars, is executed by dealing
each player a hand with a number of cards equal to or greater than the number
of players playing. Each player picks a card from his or her hand to keep,
then passes the hand to the left, and receives a hand from the player to the
right. Play continues until all cards are selected. This kind of draft accelerates
gameplay because all players are choosing at the same time. However, unlike
a Rochester draft, where all choices are visible at all times, and where players
have nearly equal access to every card, in a parallel draft, each player will
only see some fraction of the cards—as few as half in a 7-player game of 7
Wonders—and will simply not ever have the option of taking those cards.
Another consideration is if one player is particularly slow, he or she can create
a bottleneck, which often leads to confusion about which player is up to
which round of Drafting.
As mentioned earlier, Drafting, in nearly all its formats, presents two
questions. The first is what does the player value most. Many players will
stop their analysis here and select the card they like best. But, more skilled
players will ask whether they need to take that card right away, or whether,

460

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

when turn order wheels back around to them, that card will still be there. This
technique, called “wheeling,” adds tension and skill to Drafting.
Wheeling is particularly important to booster drafts of Magic: The
Gathering and other Collectible Card Games (CCG). What’s unique about
these styles of draft is that the pool of cards in the draft is unknown to any
player, since they come out of sealed booster packs. Moreover, in many CCGs,
card synergies are tightly coupled, such that once you begin drafting towards
some strategy or deck type, other cards drop to little or even negative value.
The extremes in valuation for cards between players make wheeling much
more likely to succeed, since the card that one player values the most may
have little use to the other players. When that disparity is large enough, it
might make sense to take a card that’s useless to you, simply to deny it to other
players, a move called hate-drafting.
Wheeling and hate-drafting are not mechanisms, they are behaviors that
emerges from the Drafting mechanism, and the underlying card distributions
and overall game system. They are part of what makes the Drafting
mechanism so engaging, and designers should evaluate their prototypes with
these behaviors in mind.
A few other variants on the parallel Drafting structure include whether
cards are played immediately after Drafting, as in Best Treehouse Ever, or in
turn order during a play phase, like in Medieval Academy. Sometimes, not all
cards drafted are played, as in Fairy Tale where only three of the five cards
drafted each round are played, and the other two are discarded. Another
variant is to allow players to mix their hand with the hand of cards being
passed. In this kind of setup, players may take as many cards as they wish
from the new hand, as long as they pass the correct number of cards to the
next player. Having players play a card immediately after drafting can also
help keep the draft on schedule, and avoids bottlenecking and confusion by
forcing all players to play at roughly the same cadence.
Drafting games can sometimes be played at 2 players, like in Seasons, but
they tend to be a little flat. Tides of Madness is a drafting game limited to 2
players only, and among its innovations is that players can be forced to collect
cards with madness symbols on them, and can even lose the game if they
collect too many.
7 Wonders Duel is a 2-player drafting game with quite a few mechanical
twists to ratchet up tension. Players can only draft cards on the bottom-most
revealed level of a structure, but by taking a card, they can reveal face-down
cards higher in the structure that become available for drafting. Cards can be
used for multiple purposes, including selling off for money, which incentivizes

Card Mechanisms

461

hate-drafting. In addition, there are three possible win conditions, including
two in-game sudden-death wins. One win condition is tied to a tug-of-war
contest that requires both players to take enough military cards to prevent
being overrun by the other player. Another instant-win condition is subject
to a set-collection contest in which players must draft wisely to at least
prevent their opponents from assembling the winning set. These during-game
concerns, and the possibility of forcing certain lines of play because of them,
add richness to the Drafting choices.
