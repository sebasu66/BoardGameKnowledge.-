points at the end of the game not only by building a wonder—­as the title suggests—­but also
by having a powerful military force. These are two totally different objectives for a player to
focus on during the game.

CHAPTER 2

Letting the player know all the different ways to win the game allows a player to know their
choices from the beginning of the game, and as a designer, the most important thing that
you can give a player during a game is choice.
Making a Choice
Game designer Sid Meier7 says that “a game is a series of interesting choices,” and that’s
true—­the player’s choices must be interesting to keep the player engaged in the game.
My own definition is “a game is a series of meaningful choices.” The choices must mean
something to the player and their goals. It’s even better if the player has several meaningful
choices they want to make but they can make only a few or even one of them on their turn.
What you don’t want to create is an obvious choice. That’s a decision where one choice is
clearly better than another. For example, if I have two cards in my hand and one card is
higher than the other and the highest card wins against other players, then of course I will
play that higher card. There’s no choice to be made. If I want to win the game, I will always
play the higher card.
The problem with obvious choices is that the game gets boring after a while. By making one
card clearly better than another, the player has no choice but to play the higher card. Giving
the player an obvious choice is just as bad as giving the player no choice.

Sid Meier is primarily known for designing video games like Sid Meier’s Civilization (1991) and Sid Meier’s
Pirates (2004).

Without meaningful choices, a game can feel stale. A game without meaningful choices is
uninteresting to the player. Some players say that if a game doesn’t give enough choice or if
the choices aren’t meaningful, then the game will feel like it is “on rails”—­that the players are
just moving toward a predetermined conclusion.
You should focus on designing games with meaningful choices only. Here are a few examples
of choices a player might be able to make during a game:
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

A choice between drawing a card or making a move action
A choice between buying two or more different items in a market
A choice between two treasures as a reward
A choice of which stat to raise on a character sheet
A choice of which enemy to fight first
A choice of which direction to go on a map

Creating Tension
Choice is also what creates tension during the game, and tension is what creates excitement
for the player. I find that tension is the most interesting emotion to create for the player. It’s
that feeling of being on the edge of your seat because you don’t know what is going to happen next. Fortunately, creating tension is one of the easier tricks to execute from our game
designer’s tool kit. Here are just a few of the tense (and therefore meaningful) choices you
can give a player during your game:
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

Do you keep the dice roll you have, or do you roll again?
Do you discard a card in the hopes of drawing a “better” card?
Do you risk battling an enemy even through it is stronger than you?
Do you move into an unexplored area and risk triggering a bad effect?
Do you bet a larger sum than your opponent in the hopes of winning an auction?

General Sequence of Play
How do you play? The next section in our rule book is the general sequence of play—­also
known as the order of operations. It is important to communicate this clearly to the player;
otherwise, you risk confusion and slowing down the time it takes to play the game. It is useful to view the game and all subsequent things a player can do from a top-­down perspective
when explaining the game to others.
Game ⇨ Round ⇨ Phase ⇨ Turn ⇨ Move/Action
Game is the “highest” order of operation. Considering the game in its entirety doesn’t usually have an impact on the gameplay. . .unless your game has a special rule that affects how
the game is played. For example, in Dune (2019) players take their turns counterclockwise,
and in Magic Maze (2017), players are not allowed to talk to each other during the game.

CHAPTER 2

W riti n g R u l e B oo k s I s H ard

When introducing a new or important concept like these to your game, clearly call it out—­
visually if possible—­on the page.
You will also want to do this whenever you introduce a new term or rule in your rule book.
Don’t just highlight the term or rule in bold8 or with a different color; also define the term for
the player so they don’t have to search for the definition.
Use the term consistently throughout your rule book! For example, don’t refer to what a
player needs to win as “points” on one page and “victory points” on another. I’ve seen players
get confused over something as simple as that. If you change your terminology as you are
writing your rule book (which happens more often than you might expect), make sure you go
back and change all your references to it.
Players are also more likely to be able to understand a sequence if you write them using bullet
points. That way, they are quicker and easier to find in the rule book, and the players can
(mentally or literally) check them off as they perform them in the game.
Round and Round
A round is when every player has taken a turn once. Often, a game’s length will be limited by
the number of rounds played.
As we’ve already learned, change a number, and you change the experience. Rounds are just one
of the many “knobs” available to a game designer that we can adjust to achieve different
results. The more rounds a game has, the longer it might take to play a game.
If you have designed a quick party game like Pantone the Game or Monikers (2015),9 you might
want your game to last only a few rounds to keep play light and breezy. If you want a longer
game, you can increase that number. For example, the strategy game Dune (1978) was originally played in 15 rounds. The game received criticism for taking too long to play, so when
the game was redesigned by Gale Force 9 for its re-­release in 2018, the designers reduced the
number of rounds to 10. Having played both versions of the game, 15 rounds felt like an
interminable amount of time. Reducing it created the feeling that there was “an end in sight”
and doesn’t make the game feel like it drags on. In fact, reducing the number of rounds helps
ratchet up the tension and drives players to make more aggressive actions that are crucial to
the gameplay.
Rounds can also help differentiate between different rule sets used during the game. For
example, Pantone the Game is played in three rounds with each round having a different set of
8
9

Like I’ve been doing throughout this book!
Both of those games last three rounds each.

41

42

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

rules. On each round, a player makes a creation, and the other players must guess what that
is. In the first round, the creator player uses all the color cards. In the second round, the creator player gets to use only one card of each color. In the third round, only three color cards
can be used. By breaking the gameplay into rounds, it allows the player to understand and
adapt to the new rule set much easier.
In the social deduction game Werewolf (1986), play is divided into a “day round” where players try to deduce who the werewolves are and a “night round” where the villagers “sleep” and
the werewolves stalk their prey. The clear distinction between the two rounds isn’t only pivotal to gameplay but creates wonderful opportunities for mood, theme, and storytelling.
There are more extreme examples of resetting the game’s rules round to round. In Jaws
(2019), rounds are thematically referred to as acts. The first act is set on an island where players attempt to prevent the shark player from eating tourists. In the second act, the player
actually flips over the game board, resetting the entire experience with new components. The
game now takes place on a ship, as the player battles against the shark player. It’s quite effective. This very dramatic shift in gameplay not only helps tell the story from the film that the
game is based on but also heightens the tension as the players are on a smaller playing field
from the first round.
When determining the number of rounds in your game, you might want to also consider
adjusting it based on your game’s player count or experience level. For example, in the game
Lord of the Rings the Board Game (2000), Sauron’s position on the corruption track is 15 for
starting players but is moved to 12 for experienced players—­to make the game harder. La
Citta (2000) has positions on the board that can be accessed only in higher-­player-­count
games. Small World (2009) includes a totally different map that is used for lower player counts.
W ho’s on First?
Another important round-­related mechanism is determining the first player. There are tactical advantages for going first: a player may get first pick of cards or a character or resources
or where to place their pawn. This is known as the first player advantage and is often frowned
upon by modern game designers and players. To offset this, designers will balance their
design by giving subsequent players a starting advantage.
A classic method found in many Eurogames is to give each player after the first one more
coins (or other resources) per player in front of them. So, the second player gets two
resources, the third player gets three resources, and so on.
A different option to address first player advantage is to have asymmetric drafting occur
before the game begins. This is where the last player gets first choice of cards or resources,
and the first player gets last choice.

CHAPTER 2

W riti n g R u l e B oo k s I s H ard

Making the first player shift from player to player every round or when a specific event occurs
is another way to keep things fair. In my design of Rayguns and Rocketships (2017), I made the
first player token rotate at the start of each round because being first had a definite tactical
advantage.
In Heaven & Ale (2017), the first player token is a prize that a player may select when picking
rewards. Other games award the first player token to the player who does something first or
last—­which adds to the strategy of when a player does (or doesn’t) do something on
their turn.
You can have players spend an action or bid on the first player token during gameplay—­as is
done in Stone Age (2008)—­so that when the next round starts, a totally different player will
be first! The first player token can be hotly contested in some games!
CHOOSING T HE FIR ST PL AYER
Determining the first player can be done a variety of ways. It can be based on a condition,
such as the youngest player (Candy Land, 1949), the nicest player (Dungeon Lords, 2009), the
player whose ears are the most pointed (Small World, 2009), whoever looks most like a pirate
(Cartagena, 2008), or whoever has the coldest nose (Roll to the South Pole, 2012).
Choosing first player can be turned into a competition. In Tales & Games: The Hare & the
Tortoise (2011), the first player to say what time it is gets to be the first player. In Ticket to
Ride: Europe (2005), the first player is whoever has visited the most European countries. In
Zombie Dice (2010), the player who can say “braaaaains” with the most feeling gets to go first.
Choosing first player can also be based on a component of the game as in Chess, where white
always goes first. In Betrayal at House on the Hill (2004), players look on their explorer card to
see which character’s birthday is closest to the date on which the game is being played; for
example, if we are playing on June 14th, then the player who is playing Professor Longfellow
would be first player as that character’s birthday is July 27th but not Darrin “Flash” Williams
whose birthday is June 9th.
WHY FAIRNESS MAT T ER S
Why all this fuss about who gets to be first player? Because you want to make sure that your
game is fair. Games are meant to reward skill, and as a game designer, we should make every
effort to give the player a fair shot at winning. It’s part of the unspoken agreement between
the game designer and the players.
If players consider a game to be unfair, it will ruin their enjoyment of the game. Often players
will complain how a rule is “broken” or “unfair” or “OP” (overpowered) and that it ruins the

43

44

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

fun of the game. One of the goals as a game designer is to create a “fun” experience, and anything that detracts from that is bad for our designs.
Going Through a Phase
The next operation is the phase. A phase refers to a specific type of action or activity that the
player can do only during that phase.
This is where things get confusing. There is a hotly contested debate in the board gaming
community about the use of the term phase and whether it comes before a turn, if it is part
of a turn, or something else altogether. It doesn’t help that some games use the term phase in
different ways. For example, Power Grid (2004) gameplay is split up into different phases—­a
new phase starts after a certain condition has been met.
Others use phase as the smallest measurable unit of play. For example, Magic the Gathering
(MtG, 1993) breaks up a player’s turn into five distinct phases (beginning, first main, combat, second main, end), but because a player can make choices, perform actions, and play
interrupts during these phases, I relegate MtG’s use of the term as jargon and will leave the
term phase in the order where I described it earlier.
Here are just a few examples of what are considered phases:
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

Bidding
Building
Buying
Card programming
Combat
Charity, where the player with the least money gets a small amount
Movement

Phases are helpful because they help players concentrate on a specific action. This is especially important if your game has many different actions to choose from. Once again, this is
a form of “chunking” information to a more understandable form.
If a player cannot perform the required phase action, they may pass—­not perform the
requested action, or any action for that matter.
In some games, there are strategic reasons for passing. You might not want to spend money
during a buying phase. Or you might be setting up a trap for another player to fall into, but
by taking an action, you wouldn’t get to spring the trap. In MtG, you can hold mana in
reserve for use on another player’s turn if you have an “instant” card that you can play and
the mana to power it. You might choose to pass to gain another ability, such as drawing cards
or collecting spent cards back into your hand.

CHAPTER 2

W riti n g R u l e B oo k s I s H ard

Now, there are some games where you cannot pass,10 where you must take a move to keep the
game going or balanced. Again, make sure to mention this in your rule book so your players
know what choices they have on their turn. Giving players the option to pass is just one more
choice for the player. . .and the best thing you can give the player is a choice.
Keep in mind, passing is not losing a turn. Losing a turn is when a player cannot do anything because they drew a card or landed on a space that caused them to lose a turn. In fact,
losing a turn is considered an archaic mechanism that should be avoided by modern game
designers. My philosophy is that you don’t want to prevent the player from playing the game.
But if losing a turn is hated so much, why is it in so many games? Well, it might be that those
games are a product of their time, when game designers cared less about “hurting the feelings” of other players. It could be a byproduct when more time could be spent playing a game
than today’s audience who generally want a shorter play experience. It might be that the
game designer is inexperienced and hasn’t played enough games that don’t allow players to
lose their turn, or they just think that to make a game, you need a moment when a player
loses a turn.
Whatever the case, I would avoid this mechanism. . .unless it is absolutely important to your
gameplay or game’s theme.
Is It Finally My Turn?
In most cases, a turn refers to the “taking of a turn,” in which players take all the actions that
they want/need to do. What differentiates a turn from a phase is that in a turn the player has
a choice of the types of actions they may take. This action can be to make decisions, move
pawns, fight combat, draw, play and discard cards, and generally perform the actions to help
you win the game. It helps to include an example of a typical turn—­which can be especially
helpful to a new player.
While turns are generally a solitary activity, some games allow players to interrupt a player’s turn. The storytelling game Once Upon a Time (1993) literally allows a player to interrupt
the story being told in a similar manner to how improv comedians use “yes and. . . .” If a
player attacks another player in Exploding Kittens (2015), the target may play a “Nope” card
that cancels the action of the attacker’s card.11
Another mechanism is the follow action, in which one player chooses an action, other players have a chance to follow the same action or a slightly weaker variation of the action. In
Villages of Valleria (2017), a harvest action allows the player to draw three cards, while the

Ironically, none of them features Gandalf the wizard.
It also has a “Yup” card that cancels out a “Nope” card!

45

46

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

follow action allows a player to draw one card. You can make the other players pay a cost, as
seen in Tiny Epic Galaxies (2015). In that game, players have access to a resource called culture, and whenever the active player selects an action, the other players may spend culture to
imitate that action.
Some games have simultaneous turns, where players do the same action at the same time.
In the family game Dutch Blitz (1960), all players simultaneously grab for cards as quickly as
they can! In Star Wars X-­Wing Miniatures Game (2012), all players use a dial to simultaneously select the maneuver they want to perform with their ship miniature. The order of
which player gets to go first is based on the type of ship they are “piloting.”
There are many ways for players to simultaneously select actions. Sushi Go (2013) has each
player draft a hand of cards and then pass them on to the next player. In RoboRally (1994),
all players simultaneously select and “program” direction cards that are resolved using a priority number system. RoboRally also uses a timer, in this case a minute sand timer, which
forces a player to make their decision or move within a certain time limit. If the player doesn’t
finish programming in time, their cards are randomly placed by another player!
Galaxy Trucker (2007) uses a sand timer for a more comedic effect, as players have a limited
time to make the “best” spaceship possible before time runs out. As a result, some of the
player’s spaceships turn out to be barely functional or outright terrible!
It’s Your Move
The player’s action or move is the smallest “atom”12 of play found in a game. An action usually involves the gaining or spending of resources to do a single. . .something. (Remember, a
turn is doing multiple actions.)
You might have noticed that I used the term action earlier when talking about phases. This is
one of the challenging things about game design—­that terms often get reused to describe
more than one thing.13 I will try to use distinct terms whenever possible, but if I don’t, I hope
you are able to follow along.
Some games limit the number of actions a player can do, such as one or two actions per turn.
Some games limit the number of times a player can perform or repeat an action. Another
way to limit the number of actions a player can do is to apply a cost to perform the action.
The cost a player spends might be money, food, or energy; more commonly, the cost might be

A game atom is a term I shamelessly stole from my friend, fellow game designer and former podcasting partner,
Gil Hova. You can hear him dispense gaming knowledge on the Ludology podcast at ludology.libsyn.com.
13
A perfect example of this can be found in video game design where the term level can be used to describe everything from a player’s rank to a wave of challenges to the location where the player plays! I chalk it up to a lack of an
agreed upon terminology among the game design community.
12

abstracted and simply known as action points. Players may have a limited number of
action points depending on the role they are playing, or they may have the capacity to gain
more action points over the course of the game.
An action can also literally mean a move. A move can describe the physical action of moving
a pawn across the board or the rolling of dice as in Monopoly (1935), Chutes and Ladders
(originally called Snakes and Ladders, =200 BC), and Sorry (1929).

Detailed Sequence of Play
The detailed sequence of play is where you dive into exactly what a player needs to do
when playing the game. This is where you give examples of particularly complex actions,
phases, or turns in your game. Again, follow the rules we discussed earlier where you use
illustrations, bullet points, fonts, or colors to help clarify the details. Examples are
extremely helpful only if the example is based on something that might actually happen to
the player.
You might want to provide strategy tips to the player. This is especially useful to a new
player who might be nervous about whether they are playing the game correctly.
You might want to include a designer’s note explaining an unusual, infrequent, or odd
rule. This should include explaining why you’ve created the rule that way. If the player knows
your intention, it will go a long way to helping them understand the rule.

End of Game
This is the end! Finally, we come to how to end the game. This is the win condition that
stops gameplay for the player.
However, reaching the end of the game doesn’t mean that the game is over. Here are just
some of the ways you can end a game:
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

■■
■■

The story is over.
All players are dead/only one player or team is left alive.
The boss monster is killed.
A predetermined point value or score is reached.
A predetermined number of rounds has been played. Some games have rounds skipped
by random elements or player-­generated events to keep a feeling of unpredictability
to the game.
The timer runs out.
Resources run out—­there are only so many resources left, or a predetermined number
of resources (such as cards) has been depleted.
There is no legal move left.

47

The player’s objective or win condition has been achieved.
Too much or too little—­the board has been overrun by enemy forces or all the
resources run out.
Position—­a player has control of a predetermined number of locations.
The end —­a player reaches the end of a path/racetrack.
A random event occurs—­a card or some other system stops the game.
Sudden death—­a condition arises in which if the players don’t meet the criteria, they
lose the game.
Boredom—­players get tired of playing the game and mutually consent to stop playing.

You don’t need to have only one ending condition to your game. In Glory to Rome (2005), the
game ends if the draw deck runs out, if a player lays a Foundation that claims the last Site
card, if someone completes the Catacombs, if a player builds the Forum Romanum and at
least one of each Client type and one of each type of Material, or if all other players agree to
surrender for any reason. That’s five different ways to win the game!
A Note About Stor y
As you are writing your rule book, you might want to interject some story or flavor text—­
short snippets of dialogue or description. There are different ways to present this material.
For example, the authors of Everdell (2018) tell their story in their rule book in the form of
fiction, letters, and even a poem!
If you include fiction of any type in your rule book, I suggest that you italicize that text or
print it in a different color than the main text so that readers understand that it is not part of
the rules.

Everyone Deserves Credit
To a game designer, the credits are just as important to the rules, and getting credit is an
extremely valuable thing for a game designer. We’ll talk more about credits and many of
these positions later, but you want to make sure that everyone involved in making the game
receives credit. That includes the game designer (that’s you!), anyone who helped play test
your game, the game’s artist(s), the game’s developers, anyone involved in publishing the
game, and anyone special you’d like to thank, such as someone who gave you good advice, say
in a book about designing board games. Wink. Wink.

But Wait, There’s More
There are two other things that aren’t in the rule book format I’ve presented, but they are
important to consider: the FAQs and the back page.

CHAPTER 2

W riti n g R u l e B oo k s I s H ard

The FAQs section is where you can cover a range of topics that the rule book might not
directly address. Edge cases are usually the number-­one way that a player can get tripped
up when playing a game, and the FAQs section is usually the place for them to find
an answer.
How do you create an FAQ? By playtesting your game, a lot! As you play test your game, keep
track of the questions that the players ask you. If they ask it three or more times, you should
make sure that you address it somewhere in your rules. Sometimes, as you write a rule book,
the explanation of the rules will flow from one topic to another. If you come across a question or edge case that doesn’t quite fit into the “flow” of the rules, then either include it as a
callout or place it in the FAQ.
The problem with FAQs is that they tend to grow after the rule book has been published. If
you can, place the FAQs section online (and include the link to it in your rule book) so that if
you need to add to it, you can do it much easier than having to release a new edition of
your game.
Online FAQs will also appear on BoardGameGeeks.com, but I find that it is better for
the designer and/or publisher to moderate those questions than leaving it up to the
game’s audience.
The back page is a special place because unlike the rest of the rule book, it is easy to quickly
access information from it. You can leave the rule book with the back page facing up so that
it is available to quickly reference during the game. I’ve seen the back page used for many different functions in a rule book including the following:
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

A list of the actions a player can do on their turn
A list of the different phases of the game
The cost of different resources or powers
A reference chart of the game’s icons
A guide to the different characters, races, factions, or monsters found in the game
A quick reference guide to the game
An index of keywords and where they can be found in the rule book

There are a few other things you can include in your rule book. Depending on how complex
your rule book gets, including a table of contents helps the player quickly find a topic in
the rule book. An appendix or index essentially does the same as a table of contents but
pertains to individual subjects rather than broad topics. A glossary lists definitions of
important terms and concepts used in your game. Character biographies can be fun to
include, but I suggest putting them in the back of the rule book so they don’t get in the way
of a reader who is trying to find rules.

If your rule book is longer and more complicated, then you might want to consider breaking
it into multiple, separate rule books! This is especially good if you need to have secret information to be read at specific times during the game. Betrayal at House on the Hill has three
rule books: one for the general rules, one for the survivors, and one for the traitor player!

CHAPTER 2

W riti n g R u l e B oo k s I s H ard

Star Wars X-­Wing Miniatures Game comes with two rule books: one for the general rules and
another “quick start” guide to allow the players to begin play faster until they feel ready to try
a more complex game experience.

Say What? Translating the Rules
Translations are challenging, especially if you don’t speak or write other languages. My
suggestion is, if it isn’t your native language, don’t try to translate your own rule book.
Instead, hire a professional translator to do it for you. Or even better, have the publisher do
it for you.14
Whew! That was a lot to digest. But if you follow the format and advice, then you will be on
your way to having a good rule book. But how do we know whether we have written a good
rule book?

Writing rule books is hard.
The main job of a game designer is to communicate.
Telling the rules is like telling a story.
Consider the Six Zones of Play when describing the rules of the game.
Always write to “you.”

Choice is the most important thing to give a player.
A game is a series of meaningful choices.
An obvious choice is the same as no choice.
Tension is what creates excitement for the player.

WHY IS THE chapter on play testing here? Well, that’s a great question . . . and the answer
is that even before you start designing a game, you should really be thinking about play testing. Play testing is just that critical to the game design process. Knowing how to play test
before you start play testing will save you a lot of wasted energy and effort.
When you are making a game, expect to play it over and over and over and over and over again.
Then expect to play it again. That’s because the heart of the game design process is iteration.
The following is a popular model that illustrates the process of iterative development:

54

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

The iterative design method works by building a design, testing that design with play testers and getting their feedback on what is fun and isn’t fun and what works and doesn’t work,
and then acting on that feedback—­fixing what doesn’t work, clarifying how things work,
finding the fun and adding to it.
The goal of all this iteration is to “break” the game. Breaking a game, even though it feels bad
sometimes, is actually good for the game. Just like forging and reforging the blade of a
katana, your game design will get stronger each time we break it and fix it.
It is through iteration that we gain insight on how to fix what isn’t working with our game. It
is through iteration that we learn what components are necessary for our game and what
should be removed. It is through iteration that we learn what the players enjoy doing during
the game and what they don’t like doing and what slows down the game or is too confusing.
It is our task as game designers to “lean into” what works and bring it to the forefront of your
game. If something works, do more of it. If it doesn’t work, then you should find another way
to do it or get rid of it completely. It’s better to throw out good things in your design than to
let bad things stay in it.

The Great Worry
Let’s take a moment to address a worry that many new board game designers have.
“I’m worried that if I show my game design before it’s done, someone will steal my idea.”
Most new game designers

I’m here to tell you that idea theft in the professional board game industry almost never happens. That’s not to say that it hasn’t happened. Here are three instances where it did:
■■

■■

1935: Charles Darrow “steals” Elizabeth Magie’s design for The Landlord’s Game as the
basis for his game Monopoly.1
2004: Looney Labs’ Aquarius (1998) design is copied and published as Search, Ponder
and Play by Covenant Communications. Covenant admitted to copying the game,
agreed to pay Looney a royalty, and offered to destroy all remaining copies. Looney

The issue around Monopoly is a lot more complicated than that. Homemade versions of Magie’s design were being
circulated around college campuses and in households for years before Darrow saw the game. Many of those other
players changed Magie’s design in moderate to significant ways, including giving it the name Monopoly. Darrow’s
main contributions to Monopoly were to set the game in Atlantic City and to sell it to Parker Brothers for a lot of
money. Magie was later given restitution and credit as the original designer. You can read more about this in the
excellent books Monopoly: The World’s Most Famous Game: And How It Got That Way by Philip Orbanes and The
Monopolists: Obsession, Fury and Scandal Behind the World’s Favorite Board Game by Mary Pilon.

Labs offered to sell a second edition of the game on its website that had the a­ ppropriate
copyright giving credit to designer Andrew Looney—­which, in my humble opinion,
was a very magnanimous thing for Looney Labs to do!
2014: Chinese manufacturer Ziko Games publishes an unlicensed retheme of the card
game Bang! by the name Legends of the Three Kingdoms. A court case rules in favor of
Ziko, and the case is dismissed.2

But don’t let these examples rattle you, because no one is going to steal your game design.
Let me repeat that. . .no one is going to steal your game design.
How do I know this? Because:
■■

■■

■■

Most game designers and publishers already have their own game designs that they are
working on. They don’t have the time or the desire to steal your idea.
Not all designs appeal to other game designers and publishers. For example, even if
you came up with the best game design based on the sport of cricket, I would never
steal it because I don’t like cricket (or even understand how to play it!).
It’s not worth the trouble. The last thing a game publisher wants is legal trouble. Legal
cases are expensive and time-­consuming.

On his blog at stonemaiergames.com, game designer Jamey Stegmeier gives this
advice:
You will learn far more by sharing your idea than by keeping it secret.

By sharing your idea, others can respond to it and let you know if they like the idea. They
might offer to support you as you develop your idea. They might point you toward other
games that are like your game—­which you can research to improve your design or distance it
from other existing games. Sharing protects your game by establishing precedence. The
board game industry is a very small place, so word gets around. If someone steals an idea,
others will find out about it.
I do have a word of caution about sharing: it has been scientifically proven3 that people get the
same endorphin rush from sharing an idea that they do from creating that idea. Many believe
that telling your idea to others robs you of the motivation of creating it.

Why was it dismissed? “That doesn’t seem fair,” you might say. That’s because game mechanics are not (well,
almost never) copyrightable. We’re going to learn much more about this later in the book.

Another funny thing that can happen is when synchronicity occurs. You might come up
with a game design, build it as a prototype, and even get to the point where you are play testing it at an event like ProtoSpiel or at Gen Con’s First Exposure Playtest Hall when you see
another designer’s game with a similar theme, mechanics, or both! It just happens. It’s the
reason why five underwater horror movies were released within a year of each other4 and in
1998 there were two action movies about killer asteroids threatening to hit Earth!5
Even if someone steals your idea, what matters is execution. In my game design class, I have
an assignment where I give all my students the same criteria for making a game. They all
must make a game based on the same theme with the same gameplay.
Guess what? They all make totally different games. That is because what makes your game
special is . . . you! Your interests, your perspectives, and your quirks will make your game
unique.

Let’s Start Starting
While some designers think of play testing as something that starts only when you are
“done” with the first draft of your game, I have found that there are several points during the
game development process where play testing can occur.
The following points will help to give insight about your game during different steps of the
design and development process.

The first point is what I call the “Is this a thing?” stage.

When I first come up with an idea for a game, I draw in my notebook all the components that
I think I need for the game based on the type of gameplay I’m trying to make.
Then comes the fun part! I assemble all the parts that I need for the game, and I spread them
out in front of me on the table and start to push them around to see how they would interact
with each other. I consider things like how many cards are in a player’s hand, what a

57

58

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

miniature looks like on the board that I’ve drawn on a piece of paper, how many dice might
be needed, or how many coins or other resources (such as cubes, cards, or other things) the
player might need.
After I push the components around for a bit, I start to imagine what it would be like to play
this game that I’ve thrown together, and I ask myself, “Is this a thing?” Sometimes you just
know whether the pieces are working together. At other times, maybe you need to add a little
something to make the presentation more exciting on the table.
In case I’m not being clear, this step of “Is this a thing?” is more than just prepping the game
by assembling components. It’s using your imagination to play the game partially in your
head and partially with the pieces you have in front of you. Sometimes the tactility of the
components sparks ideas on how they interact and you start to see how the pieces of the
game might fit together, even if the pathway to a successful game design is still unclear.
For example, maybe your game is “just” a deck of cards, and maybe that’s all it needs to be. But
perhaps you think it would be more helpful for the player if you had a deck of cards as well as
a player board to designate where to play or discard cards. Do you think it would be more thematic or charming if perhaps that player board is instead a paper-­craft tree, such as what was
done with the game Everdell (2018)? A little imagination at this step can take you a long way.

CHAPTER 3

You see, table presence is an important thing to consider in today’s crowded marketplace.
Over the years, I’ve seen game designers use trees, pirate ships, dark towers, zombie-­infested
buildings, cyberpunk cities, western trains, and even big fluffy beds as ways to make their
games stand out from all the other games.
I admit, I like it when a game looks more like a miniature world. I think it’s one of the appealing things about tabletop games. But I digress.

Going Solo
Once you’ve passed the “Is this a thing?” stage, you’re ready for the next stage of play testing:
solo play testing.
As you’re creating your game, the rules are still in their early, primordial form. More likely
than not, you are keeping the rules in your head even as you play the game. Get them out of
your head and into a notebook! Here’s mine:

Trust me, there are going to be moments when you will get a flash of insight about your
rules. Or maybe you will be playing another game with some friends and you realize that a

59

60

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

mechanism or rule from that game
might work great with your own
design. Don’t rely on your brain to
remember it. Brains are very squishy
things!6
No matter how good your memory
is, you will tend to forget! Get yourself in the habit of carrying around a
notebook so that you can keep track
of your rules and all the good ideas
that you get. I have been carrying a
notebook around with me for literally decades,7 and it’s saved my butt,
metaphorically, many times.
It’s also not uncommon to be worried that you
are going to make the wrong choice when
designing your game. This is part of the reason
why game design is just so dang hard. There are
literally hundreds of answers to the questions
that we are proposing as we are building our
game! What is the right answer? It depends on
what you want the players to do.
For example, if I were designing a simple card
game, a question would be “How many cards
should the player be able to hold in their hand?”
That seems like an easy question, right? But
what is the correct answer?
Is it three cards? If the player is allowed to
play one card on their turn, a hand of three
cards gives the player more choice than two
cards. But having a hand of five cards gives
the player even more choice, which is good;
but five cards, especially if the cards have unique information on each of them, will take
the player more time to read and consider what strategy to play.

T he C hapte r A bo u t P lay T e s ti n g

This gets even “worse” if the player has
seven cards or nine cards or twelve cards
in their hand—­which is a big hand of
cards, especially if you are considering it
from an ergonomic perspective.
Don’t even get me started on games like
Uno (1971) where you can literally have
dozens of cards in your hand depending
on how badly you’re playing. If the goal
of your game is to play cards quickly or to
have lots of cards you can use to create
combos or have lots of cards that you can
trade with other players, then you might
want the player to have more cards in
their hand. And that’s just addressing the
“simple” question of “How many cards
should a player have in their hand?”
My point is, when designing a game, things can get complicated quickly. Write down a
description of your game’s core gameplay to act as your “guiding star” so as your design progresses you’ll have something to help you get back on track if you ever stray from your original concept.
Here are a few examples of the descriptions of other popular games. Can you guess what
they are?8

Solo play testing can help you get a feel for what the game will play like. Granted, it won’t
answer all your questions, but it’s important when starting a game design. The goal of solo
play testing is to get your game to play the way you want it to play.
Solo play testing helps answer basic questions such as the number of components, the number of turns, and the time it takes to play the game.
Solo play testing can be a bit tricky, especially if you are new to designing games. It takes
imagination to pretend that you are several players at once. It takes even more imagination
to make decisions even though you know every choice each player has. Some games are a lot
harder to solo test—­such as games with a betrayal mechanic. Just do the best you can.
You don’t need to solo test your game a lot to get it to play the way you want it to. There’s
going to be a point where you must kick your baby game out of the nest and get it in front of
real players; however, I don’t suggest showing your new game design to just any player at first.
You want to show it to your fellow game designers.

Do It by Design
The next type of play testing you should do is with other game designers. As you know,
game designers are a special and rare breed of people who are already well versed in the language of game design.
If something in your game design is half-­done or if it is not quite right, they usually possess
the vocabulary and communication skills to describe what is wrong and how you might be
able to fix it. I find that game designers don’t require a game to be pretty or even finished to
have an opinion about it. They can imagine what your game will be. They often will know
about other games that they can point you toward for ideas.
This is because game designers in general are problem solvers. They suggest how to lop off
large areas of your design that aren’t working and remove mechanics and components and
elements that are unnecessary or redundant. They can help get to the heart of the game
design quickly—­which should be your goal at this point of the design process. This is critical
because once you have your game playing the way that you want to play, then you can go back
and elaborate on it or tighten it up.
I found that there are two types of game designers: additive game designers and reductive
game designers.
An additive game designer is somebody who starts with a single mechanic, a small or simple
game design, and keeps adding complexity and difficulty to it. A reductive game designer will
start with a very big and elaborate and maybe even complicated system and reduce and
remove elements of the game until it is balanced “just right.”

CHAPTER 3

T he C hapte r A bo u t P lay T e s ti n g

I have learned that I am an additive game designer. Often, when I am play testing a game, a
player might give feedback such as “I like this game, but I’d like to be doing more things in it.”
If I agree with this feedback, then I will add a system, another resource, or another way for
the player to win the game. You want to be careful about this way of designing because it can
cause feature creep.
It’s easy to get excited about a new idea, especially if you’ve been working on your game for a
long time. New ideas can be seductive, but you must be very critical about them. They can
add cost to your game, they can slow down gameplay, and they can upset the balance of the
game that you’ve already created.
If you have a big, elaborate design for your game with lots of complicated systems, then creating your design reductively might be a better way to work. Working this way will allow you to
start big and then focus your way. There’s no wrong way to do it. However, in my experience, I
find that there are interdependencies that will develop as you are making a game design.
If you’re not careful, you could remove something tied to another system, and everything will
unravel your game like pulling on a piece of loose yarn when knitting a sweater!
I’m not saying which is the better way to work; you must do what is best for you! What kind
of game designer are you?

So, I am fortunate enough to have game designer friends who live nearby who are always
happy to help me play test a prototype. What if you don’t have game designer friends?
Not to worry, there are plenty of ways to meet a game designer. This includes gaming conventions, game group meetups, university game design programs, and the Internet!9 I have
found that, by and large, game designers are friendly people and like helping other game
designers solve problems with their game design.

Gamers Game Games
Now that we’ve built our prototype and play tested it alone and with our game designer
friends, we are ready to play it with other gamers. Experienced game players make good
game testers because they already like to play games and have thoughts and opinions
about games.

A great example of this is a long-­running thread on Board Game Geek called “Post your Game Design Issue here—­
Get Actionable Feedback” (boardgamegeek.com/thread/2103719/post-­your-­game-­design-­

There are a few disadvantages that I’ve found when play testing with experienced gamers.
Sometimes, I’ve found that these types of players are less willing to play games that aren’t
“finished.” They feel like playing an incomplete game isn’t giving them the full experience and
