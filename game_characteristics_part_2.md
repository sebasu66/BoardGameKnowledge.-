and the game’s inherent randomness sets the tone for what feels like a satisfying
amount of play in terms of deciding a winner. Sometimes this lines up with a single
game, but it often requires more play at higher levels of competition.
Note that although a game is generally shorter than a session, that is often not the
case. A particularly long game (a complex hex wargame might be a paper example)
could be broken up into several sessions. This is very common, even standard, with
single-player computer games, due to the ability to save games in midstream. Even
paper-based RPGs are rarely completed in a session.
An atom practically has to be shorter than a session: since the atom is the shortest
satisfying unit of play, and a session is the amount of time you actually play, an atom
longer than a session is not a pleasing experience. In fact, you really need the session
length to be a multiple of the atomic length—that is, you want to end the session by
completing an atom (if not an entire game). The shorter the atomic length, the easier
it is to achieve that, and incidentally to be tempted into playing just a bit more (“let’s
play one more hand” in a card game is a lot more common than “let’s go on one
more raid” in an MMO). Computer games with save points that you can’t reach before
your session ends are one example of failure in this regard. Even if you can save anywhere, though, players will prefer to save at a point where they have reached a “logical
stopping point” (finished a turn, killed a boss, completed a quest)—that is, finished
an atom. In general, “good” atoms are ones that are fairly short, and fairly distinct,
so that players can stop when they like and still feel they have had a satisfying
experience.3
2. Japan’s greatest go player, Honinbo Shusaku, had a best-of-thirty-game match with Ota Yuzo
that lasted almost a year, although it only went for twenty-three games (Power, Invincible: The
Games of Shusaku, chap. 7).
3. Of course, there are many excellent games that don’t have “good atoms.” It’s just that, all else
being equal, having short, distinct atoms is a strength for a game. This goes back to our caveat
in the introduction about good games not needing to have every good thing—we’ll stop repeating this, but we hope the reader will continue to bear it in mind.

There are many pressures keeping atom length long, however. Players may tend to
feel a greater sense of accomplishment in longer tasks. Very often there is something
like a downtime between atoms, whether that is shuffling, switching offense and
defense in certain sports, or merely waiting for a computer game to save or a level to
load. In each of these cases, more atoms inside a given session length leads to more
downtime for the player. Also of note is that in simulation games a short atom may
simply be unacceptable for appropriate suspension of disbelief.
With all of these issues, the agential nature of session length should be kept in
mind. An atom length longer than the session length for a certain group of players is
very likely to result in having those players cease playing the game. Thus large raids
in the average MMO taking longer than an hour effectively exclude players who can
only play on their lunch break. MMOs with long raids must then provide shorter
atomic lengths in other areas of content to keep those customers, such as quests or
grinding.
The different levels of atom, game, match, session, and campaign are of course
interrelated. Longer atoms means longer games, or else fewer atoms per game. Long
games make it harder to have multiple games per session. Tournaments (which can
be thought of as extra-long sessions having some elements of a campaign) can be held
in a day if the game length is short, but will be much harder to run if the game length
is longer. If tournaments take too long to run effectively, they may not exist and
instead something like a sports season—which is essentially a tournament spread out
over many months—will become the standard campaign for that game.4
Some Examples
Let’s go through a number of game genres with these concepts in mind.
Party Games
Games like Pictionary or charades tend to have very short atomic lengths. In the case
of charades, the atom is probably more important than the game: it is very natural
for people to play for however long they would like to play. Arguably there is no
“game” as such, but really just atoms and sessions (in this sense, charades is similar
to poker). If there is an identifiable game, it may be as simple as an agreement among
the players to play a certain number of atoms (or for a certain number of minutes)
and then declare a winner.
4. Sports have seasons instead of tournaments for reasons other than game length, such as the
difficulty of arranging games between large teams and the limited possibility of playing multiple
games back to back when physical exertion is involved. Tennis, though, just manages to have
tournaments, and golf manages relatively easily because the players don’t play head to head in
pairs but rather all play simultaneously.

16

Chapter 1

With for-purchase games, there’s usually some well-defined game that comes built
in (in the case of Pictionary, reaching the end of the board’s track), but it often feels
somewhat artificially imposed on top of a charades-like fundamental layer.
Campaigns do not tend to be part of party games except in a very informal way.
This informal sense of campaign (memories of who did well in past games among a
given group, for example) can be very important to the players, but every game that’s
played repeatedly among a given group of players shares this feature, so it is not a
feature of any particular game.
Complex Paper Wargames (e.g., Third Reich)
When the game is long enough, it goes over several sessions. The atomic unit (a turn
for each player is a reasonable choice of atom) is already as long as many other games.
There is no real need for a campaign, because the game itself fulfills many of the needs
players might have for a campaign in a game of less epic scope.
Paper RPGs (e.g., Dungeons & Dragons)
Here the atoms are less clear, due to the variety of gameplay; a round of combat or
an encounter might be reasonable choices. The game (as a unit of length of play)
hardly exists at all, since there’s no winner or loser declared and no specified ending
condition.5 The focus is on the session and on the campaign.
Single-Player Computer RPGs (e.g., Diablo II)
The total number of hours a player might spend could be similar to those spent in a
complete paper RPG campaign, but because there’s an ending condition we think of
Diablo II as having a very long game length, not as a campaign with no real game like
Dungeons & Dragons. Due to the save-game feature, the atoms are more flexible (and
thus sessions easier to end at an appropriate time). However, a natural atomic ending
is finding a new teleporter, as any Diablo player who has stayed up later than planned
looking for the next teleport pad knows. For some players, Diablo doesn’t really have
a campaign, for reasons similar to that of Third Reich: just the game itself is long
enough. For others, experimentation with different characters might be considered a
kind of campaign.
MMRPGs (e.g., World of Warcraft)
A game like WoW is an interesting hybrid of the previous two cases. The atoms are
varied in length. Longer atoms, like going on a raid, are reminiscent of paper RPGs.
Shorter atoms, like checking the auction house or gathering some herbs, might be
5. One might pick the adventure as the game. Note in this case the game length would be greater
than the session length.

Basics

closer to Diablo. (Also, in Diablo, it’s possible to interrupt an atom by saving in the
middle of it, whereas in WoW, like a paper RPG, it is not possible to do so without
the agreement of the other players.) In that it has no game but only a campaign, WoW
is much more like a paper RPG than like a single-player computer RPG.
Classic Card Games
To take just two examples, recall that in poker an atom was a hand. The short length
means you can play quite a few atoms in a session. What might otherwise be an
informal campaign (like those of party games) is made more formal by means of a
long-term tracking tool: money. It’s quite natural for people to think about whether
they are up or down over the course of several sessions, if they don’t track it
explicitly.
For rubber bridge, there’s an atom—the hand—but also an explicit game made up
of around two to five hands. Some playgroups ignore the explicit game and just play
a series of hands in each play session. Most playgroups just have informal campaigns,
but there are also leagues, and the recording of masterpoints gives an explicit campaign structure (here, the length of the campaign is one’s entire bridge-playing career).
Note that in duplicate bridge, a single hand may be considered a more satisfying atom
than in rubber bridge, because a team’s quality of achievement is more measurable on
a single hand, and because each hand is more independent.
Chess
Here the game can be fairly long, but there is no atom shorter than the game (one
could argue a turn for each player is an atom, but this would be extremely unsatisfying). This makes chess less satisfying as a game to squeeze into a few empty moments.
The game length is close to a good session length. Thus sessions are less flexible (there’s
no short atom to let you end when you want, so you need to complete the game) but
satisfying if you can find the time (you get to complete a game, and you’ve played a
decent length of time when you’ve finished that game). Campaigns are broadly similar
to bridge (none/informal, leagues or clubs, and lifetime ratings).
Monopoly
This game shares with chess a somewhat long playtime with no reasonable subset of
the game being satisfying as an atom. Socially Monopoly has more in common with
party games, so its campaign structure tends like theirs to be informal.
Sports
Football, baseball, and basketball are all broadly similar in terms of game length and
in terms of campaign structure (leagues, often informal, at the very casual level, with
seasons at the level of school or professional sports). The interesting difference is in

18

Chapter 1

terms of atoms: for basketball, the atom is very short, perhaps a possession or two for
each side. The football atom is probably a possession for each side, which is a lot
longer. In baseball, it is at least an inning for each side and very likely multiple innings
so each player has a guaranteed chance to bat.
Hockey and soccer are similar to basketball in having short atoms, but the atoms
are less sharply defined. The fluidity of these games means they are closer to continuous than atomic, compared with a game like basketball where there are more distinct
drives in which the teams alternate possession. Football’s atoms are a bit more distinct
than basketball’s, and baseball’s much more so.
Injury time in soccer (where the referee adds a certain amount of time to the game
to make up for missed time due to injuries, substitutions, and the like) can be thought
of as a way of ensuring the game ends on an atom. Injury time means the game ends
at the sole discretion of the referee, who is likely to end it when an action has been
completed, rather than, say, at the moment a shot is headed toward the goal. A similar
aim is achieved by the basketball rule allowing a shot to count if the buzzer sounds
while it is in midair.
First-Person Shooters (e.g., Quake)
In an FPS, the typical atom might be the time it takes for a kill (either you are killed
and then respawn, or you kill someone and then go look for another target). All the
advantages of short atomic length, such as quick satisfying play experiences and the
ability to fit play into your real-life schedule easily, exist for an FPS. Like poker, an FPS
is often played as a session of atoms strung together, with no actual game per se.
Formal campaigns are possible but rare. In fact, the game length structure of an FPS—at
the atomic, game, session, and campaign levels—is very similar to that of poker,

From Stickball to Basketball
In the early twentieth century, children played stickball. Now the street game of choice
is probably basketball. Basketball’s success as a game of street culture has often been
attributed to its lighter requirements in terms of space (versus baseball) and equipment
(versus football). But another possible factor is basketball’s shorter atomic length. Given
a limited period of time, such as a lunch break or recess, it is possible to play a satisfactory
amount of basketball but harder to play a satisfactory amount of football or baseball. Even
a longer period of time, if it is of uncertain length (as is often the case in pickup games),
benefits from having a short atomic length. Basketball’s shorter atomic length may not
be the main reason for its relative increase in popularity, but it does seem like a prerequisite
given the modern pressures on children’s leisure time.

something that might be hard to notice if one were not looking at this characteristic
specifically.
Real-Time Strategy Games (e.g., Starcraft)
Because RTS games, like chess, progress through an early game, middle game, and
endgame, their atomic structure is less distinct. One could declare an atom to be a
few minutes of play, or a single battle (or round of base building), but there’s no really
clear atom. Probably it’s better to just think of the atomic length as being equal to
the game length. A session may be a single game over lunch, but it’s often an afternoon
or evening of several games.
Campaigns come in two different forms: in its single-player mode, an RTS usually
has an actual series of linked scenarios that form a campaign. That campaign usually
comes with a storyline or with a metagame of some sort (e.g., a conquer-the-world
Risk-type map).
A multiplayer campaign (in our sense of the word campaign) is occasionally a
“season” along the lines of a sports season, but more commonly it is centered around
a leaderboard or a ratings system.
Platformers (e.g., Super Mario Bros.)
The original arcade platformers (e.g., Donkey Kong) had single screens as atoms. This
evolved into “worlds” or “levels” as atoms in console platformers. As these atoms
became longer, it became more annoying to replay them every time one wanted to
play the game again, so save points were introduced: one could save the game at the
end of a level and then resume play from that point. As game length continued to
increase, at some point a level seemed more like a game than an atom, and a game
seemed more like a campaign. Arguably, a complex modern console platformer has
atoms something like “a few minutes of play,” a game is completion of one level, and
a campaign is the completion of the entire (purchased) game.
This trend is fairly common with deliberately designed games: a game may begin
with a short game length and short atoms, but over time designers attempt to satisfy
their more serious fans by adding content, which tends to make the atoms and the
games longer.6 Note that as the games get longer, they essentially become campaigns,
which may not always be a good thing—it may make short satisfying play experiences
less available to the players, and it can drive out the possibility of other campaign
structures. Since many players like shorter games, the longer games may appeal to a
narrower audience, opening up a space for newer shorter games: think of the relatively
broad appeal of the old NES games, the often longer and more complex games on the
6. Other factors, such as the reduction of downtime, may push game length in the other
direction.

Playstation 3 or Xbox 360, and then again of casual web games or Wii games. (Of
course, complexity is a factor as well as play length, but the two are correlated, and
more or less the same remarks apply.)
Atoms and Points
Many games with “good” atoms (short atoms with clear and satisfying boundaries)
are point-based. At the end of each atom, points are recorded, and the winner of
the game is the one with the most points at the end. Such a structure allows players
to play a more or less complete minigame in each atom, so that atoms are satisfying.
Games that benefit from this kind of structure include poker and most sports games.
Games like chess or an RTS, which have a binary victory condition (kill or be killed),
tend not to have such satisfying atoms shorter than the game itself. Note that if the
atom is short enough and the game long enough, so that many atoms will be played
in a single game, it’s common for binary victory conditions to become points—for
example, kills in an FPS. There are exceptions, of course, to the rule that points make
for good atoms: the game go is point-based, but because points can only be calculated effectively at the end of the game, they don’t serve as a basis for an atomic
structure, and go winds up being more or less like chess in terms of its atomic
structure.
To summarize, game length has a great influence on how players interact with a game
and, indeed, on whether they choose to interact with it at all. When looking at game
length, it helps to look at the length of the game’s atoms, the game itself, the session,
and the campaign.
In general, players will be happiest to end their session by completing an atom, if
not a full game. This makes games with short and satisfying atoms easier for players
to fit into their lives. Sometimes keeping the atom or game length short can conflict
with other goals the game might have, such as complexity or development through
the course of a game. Very often, though, a game designer can support those other
goals and still support short atom and game lengths (save-game features are a very
simple example of this).
In particular, there’s nothing wrong with having a very short game. If players want
a longer game experience with a short game, they can simply play again. If players
want a short experience in a long game, it’s much harder for them to find a satisfactory solution. Games with short play lengths or short atoms, such as poker and basketball, do not seem to suffer for it.

session length. Name a sport whose game length is longer than its session length.

Exercise 1.3: Different sessions of the same MMO can have quite different lengths.
What are some common session lengths for MMO play? What real-world circumstances cause them? How do MMOs satisfy these different desired session lengths in
terms of their atomic lengths (i.e., what about MMO atoms makes them fit, or fail to
fit, in various session lengths)?
1.2

Characteristic: Number of Players

How many players a game has seems like a simple enough question, but there is a bit
to untangle. In many ways, the number of sides is even more important than the
number of players: football, for example, is a two-sided game and thus takes on many
aspects of a two-player game, even though it has many players. In particular, there
are some issues (such as politics and kingmaking) that only arise in games with three
or more sides.
When we speak of a “multiplayer” game, we mean a game that has at least three
sides (and hence at least three players) unless we say otherwise. In particular, we
don’t use the term multiplayer for two-player games; this is standard usage for all
games other than computer games (where multiplayer is sometimes taken to mean
three or more players, but sometimes taken to mean two or more, in contrast to
single-player games).

Chapter 1

In this section, we’ll categorize the number of players a game can have, and discuss
a few examples. Later chapters will discuss issues arising from the number of players
in more detail.
Categorization by Number of Players
Zero-player Some “games” can be observed, but there are no players who influence
the outcome. These are games only by common parlance. John Conway’s game of Life
is one example. Another is Progress Quest, a parody computer RPG in which the player
does nothing but observe his character leveling up and gathering treasure by fighting
monsters automatically. Closer to a “real” game, but still not very close, is “raindrop
races”: a bored person on a rainy day chooses two raindrops on a windowpane and
sees which one makes it to the bottom first. The anthropomorphization of the raindrop contestants makes this very much like a real game from the spectator’s point of
view, but there are no (conscious) players.7
One-player It is useful to break one-player games into two categories, namely,
“Pure” one-player Games where the player plays more against “the system” than
against an imaginary opponent. Crossword puzzles, Tetris, card solitaire, Zork or Myst,
and Asteroids all fall into this category. Arguably even going out for a run (especially
if you are timing yourself) would fit. In addition to having only one human player,
these games have no playerlike elements in the game that behave like the player
(e.g., when you play Tetris, there is no computer player arranging blocks in the same
way you are).
One human, simulated opponents (“one and a half player”) This category exists almost
exclusively in the computer world.8 A human plays one side of the game; the computer AI plays other simulated opponents. The simulated opponents may follow
essentially the same rules a human would (e.g., playing Starcraft against the AI) or
may have their own rules (e.g., playing Diablo against the AI-controlled monsters).
Almost any computer game that has a multiplayer version falls into this category in
its single-player version. Other examples include Civilization, any first-person shooter,
and Mortal Kombat. Platformers fall somewhere between this category and the pure
one-player category, depending on how active the enemies are (trying to jump onto
a certain platform is a one-player experience; fighting a boss is a simulated twoplayer experience).
One may think of such games as a kind of Turing test—if you can write a good AI,
you’ve passed a Turing test in a limited domain, in that the (human) player experience

“Waiting at the Window” from When We Were Very Young, and probably back to the invention
of window glass.

may be quite similar to the experience that player would have against another human,
at least in terms of gameplay.9 With poker bots, this is literally true: go online, and
you don’t always know if you’re playing against humans or bots.
To some extent, any one-player game can be thought of as a one and a half player
game depending on how much you wish to anthropomorphize your opponent. Thinking of the computer as resembling a human opponent seems quite natural in a oneversus-one RTS battle against a computer AI, fairly natural with a computer RPG, but
a bit strange when playing Tetris or (card) solitaire. There is in effect something of a
continuum from one-player games to one and a half player games to two-player games
where the gap is bridged by computer AIs who may or may not play by the same rules
as humans and whose existence may or may not even be known to their human
opponent.
Two-player This is the core category in the sense that two-player games feel like the
“best” examples of games (in the same way that the sparrow feels like a particularly
good example of a bird).10 There are countless examples, such as chess, gin, Battleship,
Scrabble, tennis, most trading card games, most miniatures games and wargames, and
Starcraft. Note that many of these examples have multiplayer variants. Some games
that are commonly multiplayer can also be played two-player, such as basketball or
Quake.
Two-sided team games These are games where there are two sides or teams. Each side
plays (or tries to play) as a single entity, and each side wins or loses as a unit. Examples
include football, team shooters (e.g., Counterstrike), bridge, Mafia/werewolf, and Axis
& Allies.
In general, two-sided team games have more in common with two-player games
than they do with true multiplayer games. In particular, the political issues unique to
multiplayer games, such as kingmaking, do not appear. If one imagines a team as a
kind of complex player, two-sided games just reduce to two-player ones. The one difference is in the interteam dynamics—that is, how a single player interacts with her
teammates and contributes to the team effort.
One-sided team games A game can have a single side playing against an AI (or against
the rules of the game); this is simply the team analog of a single-player game, in the
9. Perhaps unfortunately, computer games don’t always simulate humans very well. For example,
RTS AI opponents often have a superhuman ability to click quickly and target units—that is,
they have superhuman micromanagement, but then they have very limited ability to act strategically. The experience of playing against an AI might be more fun (and more useful in terms of
improving one’s game) if the AI played in a manner a human might hope to attain. Of course,
such an AI would be harder to write. Most AI designers feel their job is done when the AI can
(depending on setting) beat most human players, regardless of how the AI does it.

Chapter 1

same way two-sided team games are similar to two-player games. One-sided team
games are commonly referred to as “cooperative games.” Examples include Gauntlet,
Knizia’s Lord of the Rings boardgame, fighting a raid boss in World of Warcraft, or playing
Starcraft as a group against the AI. Although it may vary based on a particular group’s
style of play, this is the most common way to think of paper role-playing games like
Dungeons & Dragons as well. The distinction between “one-player” and “one and a half
player” applies here as well.
Multiplayer This category includes games where there are several players or sides (at
least three), each pursuing his or her objectives.11 Examples are golf, a marathon,
poker, Trivial Pursuit, Scrabble (again), first-person shooters, (free-for-all) Starcraft, Candyland, Risk, and Clue.
Note very few high-interaction sports or high-interaction classic games fall into
this category.12 Traditionally, these genres have only achieved a true multiplayer state
at the cost of very low player interactivity. We’ll discuss this more in the next
chapter, but for now we’ll just note that high interactivity and the ability to have
multiple players (both desirable things in and of themselves) are very difficult to
combine well.
Massively Multiplayer This category encompasses games where the number of people
a given player interacts with is much smaller than the number of people playing.
World of Warcraft, Everquest, Killer and other live-action assassin games, and parimutuel betting are examples. The stock market or war might count as examples, but
the stakes are high enough that people generally do not classify them as games.
Given these categories, it’s not hard to come up with other possibilities. An RTS
game might have three humans and three AI opponents, either as teams or in a freefor-all. There are multisided team games, such as Dark Age of Camelot PvP or a team
bicycle race.
Games that allow a varying number of players often have a “sweet spot”—the
number of players where the game is best. For example, hearts is probably best with
four players. Pari-mutuel betting just needs to be “large enough,” but there’s no upper
limit: ten thousand players or a million players both look the same to an individual
player. Most people would consider the sweet spot for Texas Hold ’Em to be eight or
nine players. With World of Warcraft, the sweet spot is probably in the 1,500–2,500
range; fewer than that and the server seems empty, more than that and not only is
11. One-sided and two-sided team games are also multiplayer in the literal sense of having
multiple players, but, as mentioned above, we prefer to discuss them separately since the issues
tend to be different.
12. Classic multiplayer games that do have significant interaction limit it carefully. In Chinese
checkers, players help their opponents but can’t directly harm them. In poker, players bet against
each other but can’t directly affect each other’s hands. See section 2.2, on interactivity.

Basics

25

lag an issue, but the crowding limits comfortable access to mobs, questgivers, vendors,
and so on.
Sweet spots are usually agential. Scrabble provides an excellent example where for
a certain competitive section of the audience the two-player game is the clear sweet
spot. A more social or casual group of Scrabble players will often prefer a full game of
four.
Single-Player Games
Before computers, single-player games were relatively uncommon. When people think
of traditional games, they tend to think of two-player games like chess, or games for
even more players like hearts. There are some exceptions to this rule. Certain sports
such as racing or weightlifting can be done alone as well as in groups, although doing
so may be considered practicing or training rather than “really” doing the activity.
Puzzles of various kinds (crossword puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, sliding block puzzles) are
meant for one person. Interestingly, though, the noun game and the verb play aren’t
generally used for these activities—you don’t call weightlifting a game, or play a
crossword puzzle—perhaps indicating these activities feel less like “normal” games to
most people. Other notable examples of single-player games include card solitaire
(typically considered a game, perhaps because the platform, a deck of cards, is so
strongly associated with other activities labeled games) and slot machines (in fact,
many gambling games are single-player, with slots being perhaps the most extreme
example). Overall, though, the activities earlier generations imagined on hearing the
word game involved two or more players.
Exercise 1.4: Why do you think we use the verb play and the term game with blackjack, the slots, or other gambling games, when we don’t use it with things like crossword puzzles?
Perhaps one reason for the historical scarcity of single-player games is simply that
nonelectronic single-player games are hard to make. Uncertainty in outcome13 is at
the heart of games, and a human opponent provides much uncertainty. In fact, if the
game is fair and the opponent is equally skilled, then one’s chances of winning (in a
two-player game) are 50/50—maximal uncertainty.
Without a human opponent, uncertainty needs to come from somewhere else.
Sometimes, as in card solitaire, the game rules plus a built-in randomizing mechanism
provide enough uncertainty. Sometimes, as in crossword puzzles, the uncertainty
comes from hidden information or human ignorance, although in that case the game’s
content may be exhausted—having done the crossword puzzle once, you won’t want
to do it again. To keep playing, you’ll need fresh content. (And indeed, one can think
13. See section 5.1, on randomness.

26

Chapter 1

of the rules for some layout-heavy card solitaire games as a sort of automatic randomized puzzle generator.) Thus single-player games are more prone to exhaustion (i.e.,
have less replayability) than multiplayer games. This is not to say that individual
single-player games can’t be very replayable, just that on average multiplayer games
tend to be better for repeat play—and indeed many electronic games are designed with
a single-player core meant to be played by all, and a multiplayer mode meant to give
a high degree of replayability for those who want more.
However, computer games are very often played alone. Indeed, before computer
networking was common, PC games were almost always single-player. Even arcade
games, which tend to be played in social spaces, almost always have a single-player
mode, and many have only that mode, with social play consisting simply of score
comparison.
Some computer games (e.g., Myst) take the same approach as crossword puzzles.
Some (e.g., Minesweeper or Tetris) are like card solitaire—generating a randomized
puzzle. However, computer games have a third option: create a simulated opponent.
Doing this in a paper game is awkward at best (a few wargames do it, with exact
instructions for playing the other side). But in a computer game the level of complexity a simulated opponent requires can be hidden from the player, and highly complex
opponents can be created. Even fairly simple opponents, like the ghosts in Pac-Man,
can provide a lot of uncertainty (although good players will eventually learn the patterns involved if there’s no randomness in the system—in a sense, Pac-Man changes
from a game to a puzzle as you get better at it). Even if a computer game opts for the
handcrafted content-providing (“puzzle”) approach, or the randomized scenario-generating approach, the computer’s ability to store information and execute algorithms
helps to provide more complex content with a lower burden on the player. (The occasional downside is that hiding the details of how the system works from the player
can make it harder for the player to understand what’s going on and how she should
play the game—that is, it makes it harder for her to climb the heuristic tree.)
The risk of low replayability may be their natural disadvantage, but single-player
games have some big natural advantages as well. The greatest of these is the ease of
getting a game started—if you want to play, a single-player game lets you start right
away without having to find anyone else. Also, people like winning (although they
may get bored if you let them win all the time), and with a single-player game a player
can win more than half the time, something impossible on average with a two-player
game. If a designer thinks people would be happiest winning about 70 percent of the
time, she can make a game where that’s what happens (or make a game with multiple
difficulty levels, which amounts to making several games, with players choosing how
often they’d like to win by choosing among them). Single-player games also benefit
from having player performance that is more comparable: if we each play games of

Basics

chess or Quake, and I win mine but you lose yours, it doesn’t mean much14 about our
relative skills—too much depends on the quality of our opponents. But we can
compare our scores in Tetris, or you can boast that your guild has defeated Onyxia (a
boss monster in World of Warcraft) before mine, and the comparison means
something.
Note that all the pros and cons of single-player games are really about single-sided
games: games where there is only one side, one team, trying to achieve victory. If that
team has a single player, the game is a single-player game; if that team has multiple
players, then it’s a cooperative game. The one exception to this generalization (of
single-player attributes applying to single-sided games) is, of course, that the ease of
getting a game together really does stem from there being exactly one player of the
game.
It is also perhaps worth repeating that many single-player (or single-sided) games,
especially digital games, have an opponent that is simulated in enough detail that
much of the logic and analysis from two-player games still applies—what we’ve been
calling one and a half player games. In other words, a game that technically has just
a single human player might best be analyzed as a two-player game: playing chess
against a computer is much like playing chess against another person, at least from
the point of view of game mechanics (less so psychologically).
Changing Categories
Many games can be played in different forms (e.g., two-player or multiplayer) or have
variants that allow you to play with a different number of players. Such flexibility is
very powerful, but the game dynamics often change so much that it’s arguable whether
it’s even the same game.
The power of changing the number of players comes in part because it allows
players who like the game to play in different circumstances. Whether there are one,
two, or a larger number of people together who’d like to play a game, the game that
can support varying numbers of players is more likely to get chosen. Also, since the
different options do vary so widely, fans of the game have the chance to have very
different experiences with their favorite game.
When the number of players in a game changes,15 the game dynamics can become
very different. Even a game like Scrabble, which on the surface seems fairly similar as
a two-player game and as a four-player game, can change a great deal. In particular,

improving your next play, both change significantly.16 Other games, like team basketball versus one-on-one, change so much that one might not even consider them the
same game. Above all, taking a two-player (or one and a half player) game and turning
it into a game with three or more players can result in a great many unintended consequences; we’ll have much more to say about this topic when we further discuss
multiplayer games below.
Sometimes it’s easier to create variants involving different numbers of players from
games that have a large number of complex parts, like Magic: The Gathering or World
of Warcraft.17 With such games, a designer has so many pieces to work from that there
are many ways of creating variants.18 Games with complex emergent behavior coming
from simple rules, like chess or go, often fare less well under this treatment, but there
are plenty of exceptions like basketball or first-person shooters.
Some variants are easy to create: two-player games can often be converted into
two-sided team games by allowing multiple players to share a side. A two-sided team
game such as Werewolf or World of Warcraft battlegrounds can be made into a multiplayer nonteam game by assigning one point to each person on the winning team,
randomizing the teams every round, and declaring the person with the highest point
total at the end of the session the overall winner.19
Two common ways of creating multiplayer games are by having several players
simultaneously play one-player games more or less independently, or by adding more
players to a two-player game. We term these races and brawls respectively, and discuss
them at length in the next chapter.
For games that do allow varying numbers of players, which variant is preferred
is necessarily (being a player preference) agential, but systemic influences are
important.
In face-to-face play, two-player variants (or one-player variants, if they exist) often
have the edge over multiplayer variants simply because of the ease of assembling a
smaller number of players. With computer games, even those for which the 2+ player

damaging your opponent (both presumably at some cost to yourself) will be higher, and in a multiplayer format it will be lower (but the cost to yourself may be the same). Sometimes this effect
is strong enough to push these strategies out of the pool of strategies that good players will use.
17. World of Warcraft contains subgames in each of our categories except, ironically, pure
multiplayer.
18. However, there will be play balance challenges in games where the players can pick from
among the parts, and balancing in all of the environments simultaneously will be especially
tricky (see Gutschera’s “Costing and Balancing Game Objects”).
19. In most established team games, players come to know and enjoy playing with the same
teammates regularly, and such a system would probably be rejected. So although simple and
elegant, this method is not always applicable.

versions are considered the “standard,” the majority of play may occur in the singleplayer campaign; this is common for RTS games. It’s much easier to assemble one
player (yourself) for a computer game than it is to go online to play. Once you do go
online, though, getting several players together isn’t that much harder than finding
a single opponent, so multiplayer variants are quite common. But hardcore players,
if the multiplayer variants are highly political, may wind up preferring the two-player
version (see section 2.3, on politics).

Characteristic: Heuristics

Many games, in order to satisfy players, need to allow players to gain mastery in the
game over time.20 Players typically gain skill by developing heuristics: rules of thumb
that help them play the game.21 Some of these rules might be quite concrete (“never
draw to an inside straight” in poker) and some might be fairly vague (“develop your
pieces” in chess).
Discussions among players after a game are often about heuristics—what moves
were most effective, what decisions could have been made differently, what the correct
winning strategies are. “Monday morning quarterbacking” and other postgame analysis from spectators also tend to be about heuristics. And if someone asks “how do you
play that game?” and they already know something about the rules, chances are they
are looking, not for even more detailed rules, but for some basic heuristics. So although
they may not use the term heuristics, players of games are very much concerned about
heuristics, and discuss them all the time.
As an extreme example of the lack of heuristics, consider a game we’ll call “Guess
the Digit.” Each round, we have a computer pick a random number between a million
and a billion. We then each try to guess that digit of pi; whoever comes closest wins.
This is a deterministic game (once the computer has picked the digit), but there are
no apparent heuristics, so the game is essentially random for its players. Most people
20. A purely random “game,” like a slot machine, would be a counterexample.
21. Again, there are exceptions, such as purely physical games like a footrace, where heuristics
are of minimal importance and physical improvement is the focus. In a sprint, “run as fast as
you can” is pretty much the only heuristic.

would have little interest in playing this game—anyone who wanted to play a purely
random game would probably prefer rolling dice or flipping coins. Perhaps if one knew
enough about the distribution of the digits of pi, there might be some useful heuristics,
and the game might become more interesting. But as it is, it’s not much of a game,
due to its lack of heuristics of any kind.
It’s useful to distinguish two kinds of heuristics:
Positional heuristics These are heuristics that evaluate the state of the game—that is,
tell you who’s winning. Examples include seeing how many people are ahead of you
(and by what distance) in a race, or counting the point values of the pieces on each
side in chess.
Directional heuristics These are heuristics that tell you what strategy22 you should
follow. Examples include rules like “run as fast as you can once you see the finish
line” or “try to control the center squares.”
22. Or tactics. No distinction between the two is intended here; the point is merely to emphasize
“a choice that you as a player might make” over the evaluation of the state of the game itself.

Basics

31

For those familiar with boardgame-playing AIs, these can be thought of as board evaluation algorithms and move generation algorithms respectively.
Playing well in a game involves using these two kinds of heuristics in conjunction.
The two kinds of heuristics are of course related—for example, one simple directional
heuristic is “make moves that, when I apply my positional heuristics, look good.”23
Note in particular that if you have no useful positional heuristics (i.e., you can’t tell
which game states are good for you and which are bad), it’s hard to develop any
directional heuristics at all. On the flip side, “I’m winning if I’ve achieved a lot of my
directional heuristic goals” is a possible state heuristic.
Although in general positional and directional heuristics support each other, exceptions are possible. Consider the following two games, “Money in the Bag” and “Money
on the Table.” In Money in the Bag, each player has access to two buttons, a red one
and a blue one. Pressing the red button gives a player one dollar 80 percent of the
time; blue gives one dollar only 20 percent of the time. Any money a player receives
goes into a bag, and the contents of the bag are only revealed at the end of the game.
Each player receives ten presses. This game has powerful directional heuristics—
“always press the red button!” is a perfect guide to play. But there are no state heuristics: which player is ahead is an utter mystery until the end of the game.
In Money on the Table, there is no bag; any money gained is placed on the table
in front of the respective players. However, one button gives a dollar 51 percent of
the time, the other only 50 percent of the time, and players don’t know which is
which. This game has very clear state heuristics (the amount of money on the table),
but essentially no directional heuristics (players won’t be able to deduce which button
is which).24
Besides heuristics, depending on the game, a greater or lesser amount of specific
physical skills (running fast, aiming at onscreen targets using a mouse) may also be
involved, as may a certain amount of reading out moves (if he goes there, and I go
there, and then he goes there, what do I do then?).25
Our focus, though, is not on how to win games. Why, then, are we concerned with
heuristics? The answer is that for players to have fun, they need to have (not necessarily conscious) heuristics. Human beings playing games need to know if they are
winning or losing, and they need to know what they want to do next. We say a game
has “good heuristics” if there are heuristics available to the players that let them do
23. This heuristic is the basis for the standard search tree used in so many boardgame AIs.
24. The general version of this problem—where a player has a number of buttons to press, those
buttons yield different unknown returns, and a player wishes to maximize her returns under
repeat play—is known as the “bandit problem” (as in “one-armed bandit,” a nickname for slot
machines) and is the subject of much study in statistics.
25. These topics are discussed respectively in “Skills Players Need” in section 6.1 and in “Calculations” in section 6.5.

these things. Note this is very much dependent on the player base as well as the
structure of the game itself.
The phrase “good heuristics” is quite general, and it’s important to ask “good in
what sense?” Heuristics can be:
Clear vs. muddy How easy is it to understand and use the heuristics?
Rich vs. sparse How many heuristics does the game have? Do they cover most of the
situations that arise in actual play?
Satisfying vs. unsatisfying Do players find the heuristics enjoyable to execute, or do
they seem more like work than fun (highly agential, of course)?
Powerful vs. weak Do the heuristics provide a great deal of help in winning, or do
they just nudge the heuristic user’s chances up a bit?
In general, when we use the phrase “good heuristics” we mean good for the game, in
the sense that their presence makes the game more enjoyable. That includes being
clear, rich, and satisfying, but it doesn’t necessarily mean being powerful. Players who
want to win will naturally seek out the most powerful heuristics they can, and in that
sense they might think of powerful heuristics as “a good thing,” but having extremely
powerful heuristics may not be good for a game. Indeed, if the heuristics are too
powerful (as in Nim or tic-tac-toe, where the heuristics tell you everything you need
to win), they will be bad for players’ enjoyment of the game. We discuss this topic
further below.
Climbing the Heuristics Tree
A great deal of enjoyment in a game,26 especially for more serious players, comes from
the process of “climbing the heuristics tree”: learning successively better and more
sophisticated heuristics for a given game. For a more “serious” game, say chess, this
process of learning is arguably the main appeal of the game. Of course, this learning
and skill-gaining process is inextricably intertwined with the process of winning more
often, at least against an imaginary fixed opponent. In practice, one often tends to
find opponents of one’s own level, and thus win roughly the same ratio of games, so
the improvement may come from being able to beat better and better opponents.
For sports, and for computer games that rely heavily on reflexes, the heuristics are
only part of the process of improvement, and specific physical skills are a large part
of one’s ability at the game. In a sprint, say, it’s almost entirely physical skill, but of
course there are many sports where heuristics play a larger part. Sometimes the heuristics are not so much at the individual-player level, but at the level of the coach or
team manager. Even if the heuristic operates at an individual level, it often must be
26. Or indeed in almost any human endeavor—hardly surprising given that games are to some
extent abstract and purified models of everyday human existence.

thought of in advance, trained repeatedly, and then performed automatically during
an actual match (think, say, of fencing).
But for games without physical skill, which includes many computer games and
almost all boardgames and card games, one’s improvement at the game is based on
