any player gets to ten chips. If players A, B, and C have two chips each, and player A
decides to take a chip away from player B, you are likely to hear complaints. If
instead the chip totals are respectively two, eight, and two, and player A takes a chip
away from B (whose turn is next), the social situation, for most groups, will be much
different.
This toy game is illustrative of a not uncommon pattern of interaction in political
games, namely players try to avoid interactions that affect another player differentially
until they either feel they can win despite others’ political actions against them or
they feel they must interact negatively with a particular player, the leader, to have any
chance of winning.
To avoid misunderstanding, it should be mentioned that although political games
commonly contain argument, discussion, or debate, these features are not the defining
features of politics. A fast-paced game—say, a free-for-all RTS—may move too quickly
to allow argument. But it still has politics because people can attack other players for
arbitrary reasons: the basic ingredients of interaction and targeting are still there. And
a two-sided game like werewolf/mafia has a great deal of discussion and argument,
but no politics as we are defining it. With only two sides, there is no possibility of
choosing an opponent, hence no scope for politics.18
Some Advantages of Politics
In general, we have been talking about politics as a bad thing in games, but in practice
allowing room for political interaction has many excellent effects.
18. One could argue that, for example, the werewolves choose which member of the townsfolk
they will slay. But this is more like a football player choosing who to block: there’s a natural
choice, namely whichever opponent is most dangerous. We don’t include choices of this nature
in our concept of politics. From our point of view, these choices are more analogous to a choice
such as which opponent’s piece to take in chess—a choice that could indeed be made arbitrarily
(one doesn’t like how the knight is sculpted, say) but that does not share enough of the characteristics of what we call politics to be profitably discussed with it.

One advantage of political games, or political variants of nonpolitical games (such
as free-for-all Magic or Starcraft), is that they can provide opportunities for low-skilled
players to participate in high-skilled games (surviving and perhaps even winning
because the high-skilled players attract more attention). While some highly skilled
players may object in principle to this leveling of the playfield, in practice it allows
them to play more games due to an increased potential audience size. Additionally
it makes those games interesting, whereas otherwise they may not be, due to the
natural dampening effect on skill that political interaction can have. Finding players
to play games is generally speaking the hardest part of playing the average game,
and anything that can increase the potential audience size is extremely valuable to
both player and publisher. This is an important effect in family games and children’s
games, where the set of people playing a particular game is fixed and wide skill
ranges are common. Mario Kart and Mario Party find much advantage in their limited
politics as a way to keep multiplayer games interesting for a single family or friend
group.
Political games tend to be exciting to the very end (on the downside, depending
on the game design, they may drag on too long). The lead will change many times,
as each new winner is picked on in turn. Any player has a chance to win (the flipside
of this is that any actions other than those near the end of the game may not matter
much). One can think of “pick on the leader” as a catch-up feature. Like any catch-up
feature, it can become problematic when it is too powerful (see section 4.2 on snowball
and catch-up), but it can be perfectly reasonable in small doses—many multiplayer
games use it to good effect.
Some people just plain enjoy the social interaction, give-and-take, alliance making
and breaking, and other behaviors that are common in political games. Since complex
game mechanics tend to get wiped out by politics, it’s usually best to keep the game
relatively simple for this audience. A good example is the boardgame Diplomacy: there’s
no need to have countless kinds of military units and detailed combat simulations
with charts and die rolls. Such details would only be washed out by the negotiations,
alliances, and betrayals that are the real heart of the game.
Political games can be fun to watch, even if you don’t know the details of how a
game is played: the ebb and flow of human social interaction is something everyone
can relate to. Outrage and betrayal make for good theater as well. The TV show Survivor
is just one example. (Survivor is an extreme example of kingmaking in particular:
there’s even an extra kingmaking step where strictly eliminated players are brought
back to vote on the final winner!)
A key to understanding the place of politics in a game is understanding its audience. While classic games have evolved along with their player bases so there is a
matching of political interaction with the stomach for it among the players, a new
game needs to take this into account from the design. Is the game intended to be

Multiplayer Games

55

primarily for competitive players interested in differentiating their skill from one
another? If so, it is probably best to keep politics to a minimum by making it twosided, making it less interactive, giving players rewards for their absolute instead of
relative finish, or hampering players’ ability to target one another specifically. For a
more casual intended audience, politics can be a useful way of increasing the effective
critical mass for play, since more widely varying skill sets can find interesting games
together. Additionally, intensity of play is not nearly as much of a prerequisite for
winning in a political game.
The Difficulty of Analyzing Strategy for Targeted Interaction: The Balloon Game
Picking on the leader is not politics in the narrow sense of the term (an arbitrary decision that does not affect one’s own chance of winning);19 it’s often a natural strategy
of other players who are simply attempting to win themselves. But people’s intuition
may lead them to pick on the leader more than they should, as the following simple
game shows.
Three players, A, B, and C, each have a balloon. They each simultaneously choose
an opposing balloon and throw a dart at it. Anyone whose balloon is popped is out
(if all three hit or all three miss, everyone goes again). If only one person is knocked
out the remaining two play for the win, repeating if necessary until one of the two
wins.
Suppose A has a 60 percent chance to hit his target, B a 50 percent chance, and C
a 40 percent chance. The “obvious” strategy is for each person to go for the biggest
target (A aims at B, B and C both aim at A). This gives B a 19 percent chance to win.
If B switches to C, though, then B has a 23 percent chance to win.
Exercise 2.9:

Compute the above chances.

Thus if B takes the natural “pick on the leader” strategy, he actually gets worse results.
Although the balloon game may seem artificial, many multiplayer game situations are
not that different in broad outline: three players, one in the lead, and both of the
players who are behind attack the leader. Depending on the details of the game, that
may or may not be the correct strategy.
The player who is the leader, if he understands the situation, will be especially
frustrated that the other players are conspiring against him, even to the point of their
own detriment. He may argue against the other players’ actions, but will not necessarily be believed, for his arguments will appear self-serving (which indeed they are,
although they are still correct—B is hurting both A and himself by attacking A, and
C is the real beneficiary of B’s incorrect choice). Such a player will probably avoid
chip-taking games.
19. It is of course political in the broader sense of being a common behavior in chip-taking
games.

56

Chapter 2

Of some interest is the difficulty in analyzing real-world politics in a non-two-party system.
This is analogous to the situation in the balloon game. The amount of power a given party
in a parliament may have relative to its seats can be extremely deceptive. In the simple
example of a single majority vote with parties of size 46 percent, 45 percent, and 9 percent,
it is unclear which party holds the most power. Any two of these parties together can
decide the issue, and presumably deals on future votes can be made, significantly equalizing their power despite their relative sizes.

Players with a detailed conscious understanding of political and chip-taking
dynamics are rare,20 but many skillful players have at least some intuition that politics works against them. One can see this, for example, in RTS games, where “serious”
players avoid free-for-all variants and prefer one-on-one games or two-sided team
games.

What do political games do to state heuristics in general?

Exercise 2.11: How much politics is there in werewolf? Why does it feel like a political game?
Exercise 2.12: If the state heuristics in a highly interactive two-player game are poor,
how might this affect the politics in a multisided version of the game?
2.4

Characteristic: Kingmaking

Often in a multiplayer game, it happens that players A and B are in contention to
win, and player C has no chance. If the game has any interaction, it may be that C
is in a position to determine the winner by choosing which of the two players A and
B to interact with. This is commonly referred to as “kingmaking.”21 This choice is
necessarily political, in that C is assumed to have no choice of winning, and thus
kingmaking, like politics in general, is a property of games with three or more players
(or, more precisely, three or more sides).
20. The authors hope there will be at least a few more such players because of this
book!
21. The term is natural enough on its own (C is determining whether A or B will be “king”), but
it’s possible that it came from the Avalon Hill boardgame Kingmaker. In that game, based on the
War of the Roses, players manipulated various heirs to the throne in an attempt to get an heir
they controlled crowned king. However, a player with no viable heirs could often prevent the
heir of the leading player from ascending to the throne, thereby causing the second-place player
to win.

Multiplayer Games

Figure 2.4

The key ingredients of kingmaking are simply targeted interaction and the existence
of logically eliminated players.
Players generally, and the player who was in contention but not chosen as the
winner in particular, feel kingmaking is unfair. In some sense, kingmaking is all the
problems of politics writ large: at a single moment, the very winner of the game is
determined by the choice of a player not in contention, and all the skill and strategy
(or luck) of the other contenders is for naught. Player dislike of kingmaking is a big
reason to avoid logical elimination of players, either by always giving players a chance
to catch up or by ensuring they are strictly eliminated once they are logically eliminated. And player dislike of kingmaking is a big part of the reason that virtually no
competitive multiplayer games are high interaction with a lot of scope for targeted
interaction.
Highly political games will almost always have kingmaking. But it is possible for a
game that is not otherwise a chip-taking game still to suffer from kingmaking. If a
game includes many mechanisms to give players reasons to attack one player over
another (e.g., resources that might be easier to seize from one potential victim than
from another), a great deal of politics can be eliminated. But kingmaking may remain:
once a player is out of contention, his in-game incentives to choose one victim over
another largely vanish, and he makes a political decision whether he wants to or not
(games played for money, or other ongoing point systems, are an exception). One
example is a Swiss tournament, where a player who is out of contention can influence
who makes the top eight by conceding to a player who is borderline—while a player

58

Chapter 2

is still in contention, she’s hardly likely to concede to alter the fates of others, but
after she’s out of contention she may well do so.22
One example from “classic” sports is that of a commissioner for a league. It is quite
common for a team to be logically eliminated toward the end of a season and effectively eliminated long before that. In the real world, teams are often given benefits
for winning individual games beyond the benefits for winning or placing well within
the season, such as revenue from increased attendance. In fantasy sports leagues,
however, similar pressures are usually nonexistent, requiring a commissioner to
approve all trades. Were it not for this, kingmaking could become a virtually insurmountable issue in those groups, as players who had no chance to win the season
made unreasonably generous trades with friends who were in contention. In the world
of physical sports, revenue pressures prevent such “giveaway” trades. In the fantasy
leagues played face-to-face or among groups of friends, an agential pressure to “do
your best” can inhibit them; but in online fantasy sports leagues a commissioner is
needed.
Another less extreme type of kingmaking is blind kingmaking, where a player adds
randomness to the choice of winner but does not preferentially choose a specific
winner. Examples are poker, where a bad player in the pot will essentially give random
presents to other players at the table, or Apples to Apples, where a player might decide
to judge the winner (whose identity is unknown to the judge at the time of the decision) of a hand randomly rather than according to how well they have matched the
target word. Kingmaking in many real-time computer games has a feel somewhat
similar to that of blind kingmaking, because the choices happen so quickly and there
often isn’t time for real discussion beforehand (although somehow there always seems
to be time for recrimination after the fact). Still, though, the decision was made deliberately, so negative feelings on the part of the victim can be high.
Factors Limiting Politics and Kingmaking
Politics in general, and kingmaking in particular, are common in multiplayer games
because it doesn’t take much for them to arise: all that is needed is the ability for
players to interact, and a degree of choice as to the targets for the interaction. If these
22. In Magic: The Gathering tournaments, it is customary to concede to an opponent if he can
make the top eight and you cannot. Although it’s hardly fair to the person your opponent knocks
out of the top eight, it’s natural that the custom evolved, given that one can hope for reciprocity
from the action at a future tournament. If the tournament is pure Swiss, kingmaking can be
reduced by choosing an appropriate prize structure (giving the same prizes to people with the
same records rather than to the top eight people), but if the tournament is Swiss followed by
single elimination among the top eight, it’s hard to avoid. This is one of the few reasons to prefer
single or double elimination to Swiss.

Multiplayer Games

effects are strong enough, the game may reduce to a version of the chip-taking game,
which may not be what the designers or players want. Thus many multiplayer games
include mechanisms to inhibit politics in some way.
Of course, as we discussed above, there are advantages to politics in games as well
as disadvantages. In small doses, there may be more fun than harm, and even extremely
political games have an audience. But having spent some time looking at factors that
cause politics and kingmaking, it makes sense to spend a little time looking at factors
that inhibit them.
One very basic way a game with many players can avoid politics is by being a twosided team game. There are many players, but with only two sides, politics isn’t a
problem.23 Sometimes it makes sense for the campaign to be about individuals competing, but for the games within the campaign still to be team-based—for example,
World of Warcraft battlegrounds randomly assign people to teams for each game, but
track success over time on an individual level.
If a game has more than two sides, then limitations to the game’s politics come
mainly from limitations to interactivity. Questions to ask about the game include:
How strong is the interactivity—that is, how much can players affect the fates of other
players? Are they limited in which other players they can select as their victims? If
they are not much limited, do they at least have reasons to choose one victim over
another, reasons involving in-game benefits that accrue to the choosing player?
The extreme example here is the race: no (or almost no) interactivity allowed. Races
are therefore not limited to two players, and as a consequence often take advantage
of this fact by adding players up to other, usually physical, limits. Highly interactive
games on the other hand are almost always two-sided affairs if they have been played
for many years and achieved “classic” status. In a two-player situation, there’s no
pressure to limit interactivity, so the greater interest in interactivity triumphs (and
those who don’t want interactivity will probably be drawn to one-player games). But
in multiplayer games, one way to solve the problems of interactivity is to have the
game be a race.
Relatively few games are pure races in the sense that there is no player interactivity
at all (sprints and bicycle time trials probably come the closest).24 Very common,
though, are games where the basic structure is a race and some amount of interactivity
is layered on top: in Parcheesi you can blockade or send pieces home, in most European
23. Politics in the sense we are discussing. In the English sense of the word, of course, there can
be a lot of politics on a team, especially a team of gamers!
24. Even there, there is some interaction of the press-your-luck variety, with false starts in a
sprint and cycling differently based on the time of those who have gone before you. In nonsports
games, (close to) pure races are even less common, but Candy Land and Trivial Pursuit would be
examples. A crossword puzzle tournament might be another.

60

Chapter 2

boardgames you are accumulating points but your actions will affect the availability
of various point-accumulation strategies to the other players, and in Go Fish players
are racing to complete books but may steal cards from other players. The higher the
level of interactivity, the less the game will feel like a race (a solitaire game where you
are looking over your shoulder to see how others are doing) and the more it will
partake of the phenomena we’ve been discussing.
If the game is at its core a brawl, it will be highly interactive. But there can be limits
to which other players a given player is allowed to interact with—that is, limits to
targeting. These limits can arise by means of geography: in Risk, you can’t attack
anyone you please, but only players your pieces are adjacent to. In Quake, you can
only shoot at players in the room with you. In Magic: The Gathering, a standard multiplayer variant allows you only to interact with the players to your left and right.25
And even a chess tournament can be thought of as a multiplayer game where you are
allowed to interact with only one person at a time (namely your opponent for the
current round), a person you do not choose. Note that a mechanism like “you can
only attack those near you” is rarely chosen consciously, and is more often the result
of the flavor of the game (e.g., it’s natural for weapons to have a limited range). It’s
good to be aware of what game flavor is doing to game mechanics, though. And if a
designer wants to make a game that strays from established conventions, this awareness is vital.
If players have a lot of choice as to who they can interact with, you can still control
politics by giving them in-game benefits for interacting with specific other players. If
a player attacks another player because she controls a lot of clay, a resource he wants,
then he isn’t attacking someone just because she’s in the lead, or just because he
doesn’t like her. And she’s less likely to feel picked on—after all, it’s “fair” that he’s
attacking her, because he does want the clay.
Behaviors that involve hanging back and doing nothing are particularly pernicious,
because if everyone engages in them the game grinds to a halt. In the absence of
inducements to fight, hanging back can be tempting, because one can hope to mop
up the weakened survivors. So it’s often good to have rewards for attacking other
players. In Risk, you attack enemy players because you want their resources. Moreover,
you are encouraged to eliminate them because then you get their cards as well.26 In
25. Other games that use a similar mechanic are the live-action game Assassin/Killer and a variant
of the RTS game Rise of Nations. In the former case, you are assigned a specific target and there
is little if any benefit to you to interact with anyone other than your target (and the person
whose target you are); in the latter case, you take a high attrition damage penalty for attacking
anyone other than your assigned target.
26. Rewards for eliminating players can also help shift logical elimination to strict elimination,
which is typically an improvement.

Multiplayer Games

61

free-for-all Starcraft, you might be inclined to hang back and let others fight; in Warcraft III, however, you might want to do some fighting so that your hero gains
experience.
However, games with mechanisms to encourage players to attack one player
rather than another may still be prone to kingmaking. A player who has no chance
to win will be less likely to be influenced by whatever incentives are placed before
him. So kingmaking might require separate controls, such as making sure that players
who are about to lose won’t be able to influence the game too much, or ways to
convert logically eliminated players to strictly eliminated ones (so they won’t be
around for too long causing trouble), or at least a few mechanics that forcibly limit
targeting.
Note that some mechanisms that limit the ability of losing players to affect the
game don’t affect player interaction per se, but can still help limit kingmaking. If the
game is highly skill-based, that can sometimes make a difference, because it can limit
the ability of a losing player (who is presumably less skilled) to harm a player in
contention—think of a Quake deathmatch, where a low-skilled player can do little to
harm a high-skilled player. Even if lack of skill is not the reason a player is losing,
sometimes the very fact of being in a losing position means one has less influence—
think of an RTS, where a player close to elimination usually does not have enough
power to influence the outcome (an exception might be a player whose economy is
completely destroyed while he still has a large army in the field: this puts him in a
position analogous to the aforementioned player who is out of contention at a tournament, with no chance of winning but nevertheless an ability to influence the tournament’s outcome).

Characteristic: Teamwork

In games with several players, sometimes two or more of those players are on the same
side—that is, they form a team. Players pursuing the same goals behave, of course,
very differently from players pursuing opposing goals. In this section we discuss the
dynamics among team members, with a focus on the roles of the various players (how
they each contribute to the team’s success) and on the communication between the
team members.

One important special case is the cooperative game, where all the players are on
the same team and succeed or fail together. We will argue that the right way to look
at cooperative games is simply as a combination of single-player games and team
games. Neither single-player games nor team games are especially mysterious, although
of course each type has its own special issues, and so cooperative games don’t have
to be thought of as something mysterious either.
Roles in a Team
Players in a team game will potentially have all the desires they would in a nonteam
game, such as a desire to win, or a desire to improve their skills by climbing the
heuristics tree.27 But they’ll have a new goal as well: the desire to contribute to their
team. A successful team game will need ways for all the players to feel they are
contributing.
In part, what a player can contribute to a team’s chances depends on what role the
game assigns to that player. Sometimes those roles are symmetrical: in Counterstrike,
27. For more discussion, see section 6.2 on rewards.

Multiplayer Games

63

every player has the same game abilities as every other. Of course, players will bring
their own strengths and weaknesses to the game, but in terms of the game’s mechanics, one player is like another. In Team Fortress, however, there are specific roles such
as Medic or Scout, with different gameplay capabilities. We’ll have much more to say
about the symmetry, or lack thereof, in players’ capabilities in section 3.5. For now,
though, a brief discussion will suffice.
These roles within a team, when they exist, can be systemic, as in the Team Fortress
example, or agential. Many team games, sports in particular, have roles (i.e., positions)
that are not built into the rules, but nevertheless are so standard as to be considered
very much a part of the game: in basketball, for example, the positions such as point
guard or power forward have no special rules status. In soccer, the goalie has special
status within the rules but all the other positions are agential.
In games with systemic roles, there may be additional agential roles layered on top
of them. For instance, World of Warcraft classes such as Warrior, Rogue, or Druid are
built into the system directly. Roles such as tank, dps (damage dealer—the term comes
from “damage per second”), or healer, however, are not as directly defined. One
warrior might serve as a tank; another might focus on dps. Of course, the game in
general and the classes in particular were certainly designed with roles in mind, so it
is arguable exactly how agential the roles are. Still, the roles definitely have a different
status than the classes, and they are arguably more fundamental: it might be better
to think of a World of Warcraft “team” as a tank, a healer, two dps’ers, and a hybrid,
than to think of it as a Warrior, a Priest, a Rogue, a Mage, and a Druid.
In deliberately designed games where different roles are built in, two common
strategies can help each player feel she’s making a contribution. One is to balance the
various roles, so that no one player contributes more to the team’s victory than
another. The other is to give each role unique abilities, as in an RPG where one player
can heal and the others cannot. If everyone can heal a little, but some are better than
others, then the roles may still be different, but the feeling a player has that her contribution is unique will be less. How different to make the roles is tricky—certain
functions may be so basic to the game (e.g., dealing damage in an RPG) that it is often
best to ensure everyone is good at them; others (e.g., healing) can be given out to
some and not to others; and sometimes one can look for small truly unique functions
and parcel them out carefully (e.g., in World of Warcraft, Mages get teleportation;
Druids get a special swimming form).28
28. The situation here of a designer doling out powers to different player roles in the design is
analogous to the skills one might want when putting together a good team. For example, in
basketball every player needs to be able to dribble and pass well, but only certain positions need
to rebound or make three-point shots well. In one case, it is a matter of the game giving abilities
to certain players; in the other, of the game requiring certain abilities of the players.

64

Chapter 2

If all the roles are identical (i.e., there is only one role), then potential contributions
are automatically balanced—every player has the same chance to contribute. Actual
contributions, of course, will vary according to player skill. Everyone on the bowling
team or on a Counterstrike team has the same chance to contribute, but the more skilled
players will tend to contribute more.29
If the roles vary, balance will take some work. The modern expectation is that this
work will at least be attempted, and every contribution will be roughly equal (e.g.,
classes in an MMO or races in an RTS will be balanced). Sports, however, do not follow
this logic: the quarterback contributes a disproportionately large amount to a football
team, and a pitcher contributes an extremely large amount to a baseball team. And
players who sit on the bench may, at least in any given game, contribute nothing at
all. But even in sports, efforts are made to help give players a chance to contribute:
mandatory rotation of batters in baseball, or the widening of the tennis court in
doubles so that it’s harder for one person to cover the whole court.
One role deserving special mention is that of leader. Team leadership may involve
a formal or an informal role, though even when there is a specific team captain, that
role may not be specified by the rules system. (But it’s often associated with a systemic
role—for example, the leader of the offense on a football team is often the player who
plays the quarterback position.) The leader may be responsible for many things:
helping train players before the game, making team decisions during play, or giving
advice during the game. In organized sports, the leader may be someone who isn’t
even a player: a coach. But almost any team game has—if the team has played together
more than once—at least informal leadership, typically coming from the most skilled
players. In large or complex teams, there will often be multiple leaders, typically with
specializations: offensive and defensive coaches in a football team, or a guildmaster,
several officers, and a raid leader in an MMO guild.
Cooperative Interaction among Team Members
Team games vary widely in the amount of cooperative interaction30 among the team
members: the amount they can influence each other’s performance. With a swim meet
or a bowling league, each player is essentially playing solo, and a team score is calcu29. There is a subtle difference, though: in bowling, everyone will contribute, since the scores
are averaged. It matters to the team how their weakest member performs. With Counterstrike, the
weakest team member may be contributing nothing, or even making the team worse (say, by
alerting the enemy prematurely)—this situation is discussed further below.
30. We use this somewhat awkward term to distinguish it from the type of interaction discussed
in section 2.2, where players influence the performance of opposing players. (Simply calling it
“cooperation” is problematic because it is not a feature exclusive to cooperative games, and
indeed it is possible in principle for a cooperative game not to have it.)

Multiplayer Games

65

lated by combining the individual contributions. With doubles tennis, players must
decide who goes after which ball and they must avoid colliding with each other, but
each player still hits the ball for himself. With football or basketball, one player throws
and another player catches.
Exercise 2.17:
interactivity.

Give some nonsports examples of various levels of cooperative

In and of itself, cooperative interactivity is a good thing, in the sense that interacting with teammates is something many people enjoy—humans are social animals. (Of
course there are definitely those for whom the low level of interaction of a bowling
league is just right; solitaire would be too little and basketball would be too much—as
always, knowing your audience is key.) Also, team interactions introduce all sorts of
interesting heuristics (should I pass the ball now, or keep it for myself? should I heal
our damage dealer or save my mana to heal our tank later?). But problems can arise
when the levels of such interaction are high. The situation is loosely analogous to the
one discussed in section 2.2. There, the problem was that interactivity (among opposing players) of the wrong sort led to political problems like picking on the leader and
kingmaking. Here, problematic cooperative interactivity tends to take the form of
socially unpleasant interactions and of role usurpation, both of which we will now
discuss.
In any team game, having good teammates will help you succeed, and bad teammates will hurt your chances. The impact of your teammates on your game experience, however, will vary widely depending on how much cooperative interaction
the game has. If the game has very little (e.g., a swim meet), you can still give your
best performance regardless of how your teammates perform. Bad performances on
their part simply lower the team’s overall chance of winning. But if you interact with
your teammates a lot, you will be more frustrated if they don’t perform well: you
might throw the ball perfectly, but they still fail to catch it. At an extreme, there are
games where a bad teammate is so punishing for the group that you’d rather play
a person short than have him on your team; Defense of the Ancients (where a teammate who dies frequently will thereby “feed” experience points to the other team,
making them more powerful) is an example. Such games tend to be very hostile to
beginners and low-skilled players generally, and may develop unpleasant player
communities.
There is a difference in the emotional experience of being a bad player on the chess
team and being a bad player on the football team. This phenomenon is partly social
(different sorts of people play chess than play football), but it is partly due to game
design—if I do not castle when I should, your chess game still runs smoothly, but if
I drop the ball you threw, you may be outraged. And indeed, the people playing

Defense of the Ancients are probably more like the people who play chess—but they act
worse to their teammates than any football player would.31
When a team’s performance is determined by combining individual results, as with
a chess team or a fencing team, even when a teammate lets you down, you still have
a clear scale of your own by which to measure your performance. A player’s personal
achievement isn’t disrupted by his teammate’s poor play. The more individual achievement can be culled from team performance, the less social pressure there may be on
individual team members.
Professional sports can be thought of as individual competitive games since the
players are individually competing for their next contract, to the consternation of
owners, coaches, and fans. In this light personal statistical achievement at the expense
of the team seems very reasonable. Part of the challenge of the coach is to align player
and team goals as closely as possible.
Exercise 2.18: What other factors in Defense of the Ancients (or another unfriendly
online game of your choice) make for a difficult team environment?
Telling Teammates What to Do
In addition to interacting via the play of the game, team members may communicate
directly. Games often vary as to how much communication they allow, and may have
special restrictions on communication. Bridge is the classic example: direct communication is forbidden—you can’t just tell your partner “I have the ace of hearts”—but
signaling both in the bidding and in the play of the cards is extremely important and
highly complex. Much of the interest in play is in the limitations on teammates signaling their individual hidden information. Tellingly, although hidden information
is no longer an issue for one team once the dummy has been determined, information
flow isn’t merely restricted, it is cut off completely. If it were allowed the better player
would make all the decisions on offense by simply telling her partner what to do.
The problem of one’s role being entirely usurped, by having another player on your
team tell you exactly what to do, is bad enough that no traditional game has it, but
some deliberately designed games do suffer from it. Turn-based cooperative games are
probably the most vulnerable, for reasons we’ll discuss below.
In modest amounts, having someone else tell you what to do in a game is acceptable, or even good. Coaches, team captains, or simply experienced players can make a
game better for team members by giving advice. Of course, not all less experienced
players will follow the advice they are given. Perhaps they fail to understand it, or they
cannot execute it. Or perhaps they prefer to “go rogue,” trying to kill opponents rather
31. Of course, the anonymity of the Internet also has a lot to do with the unpleasant behavior.
But Defense of the Ancients behavior is worse than most other Internet games, so again the game
design is relevant.

than guard a position in an FPS or running around chasing the ball in soccer—pursuing
individual glory rather than team victory. However, especially for teams of adults that
play together regularly, players’ desire for victory, along with peer pressure, is usually
enough to induce players to follow whatever expert advice may be available.
But if communication results in the expert telling the beginner what to do to the
point of the beginner being effectively removed from the game, the beginner won’t
have much fun. When does this effective removal happen?
Perhaps the most useful perspective is that it happens unless something prevents
it—that is, the human desire to win and the greater skill of the expert will tend to
push the expert into playing the game for the beginner unless there is some mechanism to stop it. Probably the most important mechanism is “skilled control”: physical
skill like aiming or jumping that cannot simply be told to someone. If Kasparov tells
you to move your rook forward two squares, your making that move will be just as
good as if Kasparov made the move himself.32 If Michael Jordan tells you to throw the
ball through the round metal hoop, there is still something for you to do. Hence chess
coaches are not allowed to give suggestions to their players during a game, but basketball coaches are.
Closely related to skilled control (arguably a special case of it) are time pressure and
complexity. If a great many operations have to be performed quickly, there just is not
time for an expert to direct a beginner to do each one. Thus in a team RTS game, an
experienced player can give advice, but the performance of the other players still very
much matters. With a turn-based game such as chess, though, exact instructions can
be given and carried out.
Even for turn-based team games, all is not lost. Experts can be prevented from
playing the game for beginners by having rules that limit communication. Hidden
information, such as cards a player holds that teammates cannot see, prevents experts
from knowing enough to advise beginners (of course, simply telling your teammates
what you are holding must be prevented). For games where it makes sense, role playing
can help as well: the know-it-all playing the wizard may tell you the optimal strategy
for your barbarian, but you may feel free to ignore him as you charge into the enemies
because it is “in character.”
Cooperative Games
Cooperative games are simply single-sided games with more than one player on that
single side. Most if not all of the higher-level issues that arise in cooperative games
can be found in some form in single-player games or in two-sided team games.
32. A classic story illustrating this point is that of the little girl who manages to defeat (or at
least draw against) a chess grandmaster. She plays two of them at once, as white in one game
and as black in the other. In each game she makes the move that the grandmaster makes in the
other game, and thus is guaranteed to at least draw against one of her two opponents.

Role playing

Cooperative games were relatively rare until recently—almost all games either had
two or more sides, or were single-player games. Most examples of cooperative games
come from computer gaming, with a few examples (e.g., Pandemic or Reiner Knizia’s
Lord of the Rings) from modern boardgames. Instances outside of these categories are
few, but might include pairs figure skating, two people working on a jigsaw puzzle
together, or Hacky Sack (perhaps also Dungeons & Dragons, depending on how you
interpret the role of the dungeon master).
It is perhaps natural that cooperative games were rare until recently. An opponent
provides so much, in terms of uncertainty of outcome and repeat play value, that
having one is a big benefit to a game. If you simply cannot find one, then you will
need to play a single-player game. But if you can find one or more other players, a
game with opponents is probably your best bet.
All this changes with the advent of the computer. Now, the computer can be your
opponent. It is still hard to get people together, but the advantages of having an
opponent and the capabilities of the computer push games toward the “one and a
half player” category. Add in computer networking, so that other players are now
easily available, and computer games naturally evolve in two ways: those new players
become your opponents (as in most precomputer games), or they become your teammates against the computer—that is, you have cooperative games. Thus the existence
of both AI opponents and computer networking allows games to offer the social benefits and heuristic challenges of team play, along with the greater than 50 percent
average win percentages found in single-player games.
Although cooperative games can be seen as single-sided games with teamwork,
some issues do loom larger because of the combination. For example, take the issue
that some team games have of expert players playing the game for beginners. In a
game like bridge, if one partner begins to tell the other what to do, the opponents
will object. In a cooperative boardgame like Pandemic, there are no opponents to object
when one player directs another. Granted, the player being directed may object, but
the argument is less compelling: “I’d rather play myself, thanks” as opposed to “Hey,
that’s cheating!”

Or take the problem of limited replayability to which single-sided games are sometimes prone. Like many single-player games, MMOs suffer from this problem, and the
pressure on the content creators of the MMO is large. But the team nature of the MMO
can amplify the problem, as players repeat content for the benefit of other team
members. How many people would go on the same MMO raid as often as they do if
not for the need to help their guildmates? Of course, on balance the additional interest
generated by other players, especially teammates, more than makes up for these costs
in a good MMO, but the point is that all these pros and cons can be understood as
arising from issues pertaining to single-sided play, issues pertaining to team play, and
the interactions between them.

3 Infrastructure

In this chapter, we discuss some of the basic systemic elements of games: ingredients
of the game system that help make the game what it is. Games can be complicated,
and some of our ingredients will be partially agential, but it’s probably helpful to think
of them as systemic first with agential overtones.
We begin, naturally enough, with a discussion of rules—what kinds there are, how
they are enforced, to what extent they “are” the game (our feeling: less so than commonly supposed), and how they can sometimes become a barrier to play. Rules often
fall in clusters, such as the rules surrounding shuffling, dealing, trick-taking, and the
like common to so many card games. We refer to such clusters as “standards” and
discuss them in the next section.
Games typically end at some point, and the different states in which they can end
(with a unique winner, with several winners, with everyone assigned a numerical
score) and the conditions that cause them to end (such as time running out, or a
player checkmating an opponent’s king) are the subjects of the next two sections.
Going backward from the end of the game to its beginning, we then discuss different
possible starting positions for games. Finally, we briefly discuss how games interact
with the human senses.
3.1

Characteristic: Rules

Games, of course, have rules: instructions telling players what actions they can take
and what the outcome (immediately, in terms of changed game state; ultimately, in
terms of winning or losing) of various actions will be. Rules may be enforced by the
players themselves (common in casual paper games), enforced by judges (common in
formal sporting events), or enforced by the structure of the gameplay environment
itself. This last can be seen in a football game, where the laws of physics enforce some
outcomes (kick the ball just so and it will go through the goalposts), or in a computer
game (where the code, if working as intended, ensures that only legal actions can be
taken, and that they will have the appropriate results; in some sense both rules and

72

enforcement are the same here). In particular, note that we are not using rules in the
narrow sense of “rules written in a rulebook” but in a broader sense that includes
other instructions one might need in order to play, or that determine how one does
play.1
There are many delicacies of definition involved, and many borderline cases (e.g.,
universally accepted play practices that are not in fact written in the rules—are they
“rules” or not?). It’s not our intention to focus overmuch on marginal cases, however.
In keeping with a more practical approach, we wish to focus on how rules affect the
play of the game, and how they interact with the other characteristics.
Before beginning, though, perhaps one slightly less practical observation is still
worth making. People often tend to think of the rules of a game as equal to the game
in some abstract sense. We don’t like this point of view. Think of all the minor rule
changes that have happened in, say, basketball over the last twenty years. Is it a different game every time? Only a pedant would say yes. To most people, it is still basketball (of course, if you change enough rules it would not be basketball, and rugby
and football, say, are pretty clearly different games despite having evolved from the
same roots). A better viewpoint is to think of the rules to a game as like the words to
a story: a story can still be Little Red Riding Hood despite having different words from
some other version. In fact it can even have a completely different ending. For
example, Little Red Riding Hood herself sometimes lives and sometimes dies, but both
versions are still Little Red Riding Hood! If enough elements are the same, the two versions are the same story. As always, there will be borderline cases (is Clueless the same
story as Emma, or not?). And although the rules are not the game, the rules let one
experience the game by playing it, just as the words let one experience the story by
reading it.
Another way to see that the rules are not the game is in the common occurrence
of changing rules in order to keep the game the same. If players find some strategy
that changes the play of the game drastically, and there is a general consensus that
this change is for the worse, the rules may be changed to disallow the strategy. Patches
to eliminate exploits in computer games, or the banning of cards in Magic, are further
examples: technically they change the rules, but they do so in order to make postchange play similar to the play experience before the exploit was discovered.
Just as Little Red Riding Hood is an entity having life outside its specific text, games
are usually entities that live beyond their rules. The various rule changes to basketball
adding a shot clock, making goaltending illegal, or adding a three-point line are rule
changes universally designed to make the rules of basketball match the concept of the
game of basketball—how it was initially played and how it is supposed to be played.
1. We do not use the term rules to include “rules of thumb” or other guidelines on how to play
well, however. In other words, rules for us do not include heuristics.

74

Chapter 3

The situation is not different in most other games. Many rule changes from patched
computer games to professional sports serve as instructive examples that games are
not defined by their rules. Most commonly the rules are defined by the games.
First-Order and Second-Order Rules
A useful practical distinction can be made between what we call first-order rules and
second-order rules. First-order rules are rules that anyone needs to know in order to
play (or profitably watch) the game. Second-order rules are rules that someone needs
