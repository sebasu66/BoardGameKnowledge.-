Finale

Description
When the main game ends, a special mini-game is played to determine the
victor.

Discussion
This Finale mechanism adds a coda to a game, as it transitions to an alternate
play mode at the end.
In Monsters Menace America, players spend the bulk of the game moving
their monsters around the United States, stomping on cities, battling the
military, gaining upgrades and becoming more powerful.
When the endgame is triggered, the players begin a monster demolition
derby of sorts. The board is ignored, and the monsters simply battle against
each other to determine the final victor. While the player that did the best
during the first part of the game has the best chance to win, it could still be
anyone.
Cable Car is a connection game. But when players complete their
connections they do not simply win. Instead, they need to begin running
their cable car from one end of their track to the other, moving a few spaces
per turn. The remaining players continue taking their turns, and anyone who
completes their track can start moving their car. The player who gets their car
to the end of their track first is the winner.

Game End and Victory

197

This final contest rewards efficiency in both building the track as well as
maximizing the speed of the car. If you complete a very circuitous route first,
you may still lose to a player who was better able to manage their tiles better
and build an efficient route.
Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot is another example.
Players can earn a numbered Magic Carrot during the course of the game.
When they are all claimed, the game ends, and the winner is determined via
lottery. The players draw one carrot at a time from a second carrot deck. The
carrots drawn are losing carrots. Whoever has the final carrot remaining in
the deck is the winner.
This mechanism makes it clear to players what they need to do during the
game to win and adds an exciting end game element. However, it can also
cheapen the meaning of the first part of the game, as a player may dominate
the main game, earning ten tickets while the other players each get only one,
and still lose. As such, this is best suited for quicker and lighter games.
The Finale mechanism is infrequently used as it often requires players to
learn a whole different set of mechanisms to be used for the ending.

King of the Hill

Description
Players earn points by occupying a special position on the board.

Discussion
King of the Hill (KotH) brings several positive attributes to a game. First, it
is simple for players to understand what they need to do to achieve victory.
Gaining points or other benefits by controlling the key location makes the
objective clear to first-time players. In King of Tokyo, players earn points by
remaining in the center of the board throughout the turn, giving the board
state great clarity.
Second, it forces players into conflict. Staying in your own corner of the
board (“turtling”) will not move you closer to victory.
Finally, it gives players a safe space to rebuild and lick their wounds if they
are weaker. If a player is in a bad position, they can simply stay out of the line
of fire until ready. This can push battle games to a more casual place, as the
strong either cannot, or are not incentivized to, pick on the weak. It also leads
naturally to a Catch the Leader mechanism (VIC-18), as everyone will gang
up on the player earning points in the center.
Because of all these items, pure KotH can make a game feel lighter. Players
will try to knock each other out of the center, but conflict does not extend
beyond that.

Game End and Victory

199

Some games have a reward other than Victory Points associated with
holding the center. For example, in Nexus Ops, the player controlling the
center Monolith may draw special Energy cards that aid in various ways.
This encourages players to head for the center and the bonuses there, but also
allows for alternate paths to victory.

Catch the Leader

Description
The game systems advantage players that are behind or disadvantage players
that are ahead.

Discussion
This is a meta-mechanism that can be implemented in a variety of ways.
For example, Power Grid changes turn order based on who is leading. The
player in last always takes the most advantageous position. Age of Steam forces
players to reduce their Victory Points (VPs) based on how many they have.
Players who have more points must lose more. Other games may give special
tokens or abilities to players that are lagging.
While these are all overt, some Catch the Leader mechanisms are more
subtle. A King of the Hill mechanism (VIC-17) typically exposes the leader
to attack, and not other players—or players that are further behind are less
attractive targets. This will naturally incentivize players to try to pull back
the leader.
The designer should consider the severity of the Catch the Leader
mechanism. If it is too strong, it can be advantageous for players to sandbag,
and try to stay back to make a strong late move rather than be penalized

Game End and Victory

201

earlier. Depending on the theme and nature of the game, this may or may
not be desirable.
Designers should also look out for the opposite of a Catch the Leader
mechanism (“snowballs”), where the game mechanisms make it easier for
players in the lead to get further ahead. Economic games are susceptible
to this, as the measure of victory (money) is also the resource that helps
growth and power. Monopoly is an example. Splitting the victory currency
from cash can alleviate this issue. For example, players may need to use cash
to buy antiques, which actually give VPs. This forces players to decide when
to turn their working resource into a victory resource. See Victory Points as
a Resource for more details (VIC-04).

Tug of War

Description
A marker is moved up and back on a track towards or away from a neutral
position.

Discussion
Tug of War can be both a scoring mechanism and an end-game trigger.
In its simplest form, two players will move a marker back and forth along
a track, with each of them owning one end of the track. If the marker reaches
the end of a track it typically triggers an event, such as ending the game, as in
Twilight Struggle. In this case it also triggers victory for the player who moves
the marker to their end.
It may also trigger a scoring event, as in Guardians, where each location has
a short tug-of-war track. If the marker reaches the end of a track, the player
owning that end scores points for the location, and it is removed from the
game and replaced.
Tug of War is not limited to two players. When there are three or more
sides represented, each has a branch leading from a central neutral point.
Churchill is a three-player game, with players debating over issues around
World War II. Each issue starts in the center of the track. When a player
influences an issue, it moves towards their track, or, if it is on another player’s
track, first towards the neutral point, and then up their track. Churchill also
has a special trigger if an issue reaches the end of one of the tracks. In that
case, the issue is locked for that player, and it can no longer be influenced up
and down the tracks. The game also features multiple issues on the tug-of-war
track at the same time, allowing the designer to introduce more complexity
and player options by allowing multiple issues to be influenced with one
action, or special bonuses for certain types of issues.

Game End and Victory

203

Another example of multiple players influencing multiple items is Starship
Samurai, where players are trying to sway factions to their side. Each player
has a track on the alliance board, and if a faction is on another player’s track,
in order to sway them to your side you first move the faction token down
towards a neutral zone off of that player’s track, and then up your track.
The location of the marker can also award points or abilities at certain
times. In Twilight Struggle, for example, if no Sudden Death conditions are
triggered (VIC-15) and the game ends by concluding the final turn, the
winner is decided by the location of the marker on the track. The location
of the markers at Conference end in Churchill at the end of the debate phase
determines who gets to decide on the outcome of the issue. Starship Samurai
awards victory points or resources based on the location of each faction at
the end of the round.
This mechanism is very clean and easy for players to understand,
particularly in the two-player version. It is easy for players to see where they
stand, and what actions influence the track. When used for an end-game
condition, it is typically used as a Sudden Death condition, as requiring that
the marker reach the end means that there needs to be some means to drive
the game towards a conclusion. It also means that as one player moves closer
to victory, the other moves further away. This can reduce tension as compared
to a Completing Targets system (VIC-11), where all players may be close to
victory at the same time.

Highest Lowest

Description
Each player’s score is equal to the lowest value of several categories. Whoever
has the highest lowest value is the winner.

Discussion
As the title of this Highest Lowest mechanism may be a bit unclear, here is
a more lengthy explanation using the diagram above. Let’s say players are
collecting the four icons in the image above—swords, fish, leaves, and grapes.
Player A has 10 swords, 5 fish, 7 leaves, and 2 grapes. Their final score will be
the lowest of those four—in this case the 2 grapes, so 2 points.
First used in Knizia’s Tigris & Euphrates, this scoring mechanism forces
players to pursue multiple paths equally. Specializing in gaining red, for
example, will not be a winning strategy. This forces players to generalize, and
typically encourages player interaction as they compete in the same areas.
Tigris & Euphrates has players collecting cubes of different colors to
determine the final score. When using cubes, this system is the same as
collecting sets of one of each color. Later implementations like Ingenious and
Wendake use tracks, which can make it easier to visualize the current score,
as it is just the lowest track marker.
Ingenious adds an additional twist, as while final scoring is based on the
lowest color value, during the game bonuses are awarded for getting a high
value of a particular color. So, tension is introduced between staying balanced
and specializing.

Game End and Victory

205

Wendake has two separate pairs of tracks, and the value of each pair is equal
to the lowest of the two. Then, the scores for each pair are added together to
determine the final score. Adding this additional level of detail groups certain
aspects together and opens up more strategic design space.

Uncertainty

ӶӶ
Games, like life, are full of uncertainty: the roll of the dice, the turn of a
card, the cube tumbling through the cube tower. But even in games of perfect
information, such as Chess, our opponents’ choices make our knowledge of
how the game will unfold, imperfect.
The source of uncertainty and how uncertainty is perceived contributes
much to the shape of the overall player experience. Uncertainty that comes
from a truly random process, like a die roll, creates a lighter and more
chaotic feeling for players—even if the design calls for throwing enough dice
enough times to smooth out the worst ends of the distribution curve. Players
participating in a rock-paper-scissors contest, however, will feel a greater sense
of agency and will harbor a belief, right or wrong, that the outcome of the
contest is not random.
Uncertainty lurks in many unexpected places. Can you rely on your
memory? Did the King of Hearts already go out? Did you properly deduce
where Jack the Ripper moved to? What is your partner signaling to you with
that drawing? Who is the werewolf? Can you balance Rhino Hero on the
next card up the tower?
Uncertainty can create chaos, but players can also manage uncertainty
using different tools. Betting, bluffing, and even deck-building all help
manage card-draw randomness. Letting players see the result of a random
process before needing to make a decision about it, such that the random
result is an input in their decision-making—input randomness—makes
randomness something players respond to, rather than rely on. On the other
hand, forcing players to make a high-stakes decision contingent on a random
outcome—output randomness—creates enormous drama and tension.

207

208

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Because uncertainty can have a powerful impact on the game experience,
designers often seek to control its influence in a variety of ways. In some
cases this is baked into the design itself, through the distribution of cards in
a deck, or the number of dice that must be rolled, and similar systemic design
elements. In many cases though, the power to mitigate uncertainty is given
to players. Dice manipulation powers, card- and deck-manipulation powers,
and other kinds of special abilities do give players greater agency.
While there is a loud contingent of players who disdain randomness and
luck in games, a word to the wise: the most successful commercial games
typically have far more luck in them than the most highly regarded hobby
games. Games with more uncertainty and randomness tend to be accessible
to more players, and facilitate enjoyment even when there are large skill
differences between players at the same table. Having a clear focus on the
intended market for your game will serve as a crucial guide in determining
how to handle uncertainty.
Designers have a broad palette of colors to paint with when it comes to the
sources of uncertainty, its framing, and how players experience it. Managing
uncertainty properly is key to the art of game design.

Betting and Bluffing

Description
Players commit a stake of currency or resources to purchase a chance of
winning everyone’s stake, based on some random outcome like being dealt a
superior set of cards or rolling a higher number. Players typically have partial
information about the overall game state, and may “bluff,” by representing
through their in-game actions that they hold a stronger position than they
do. Conversely, players may “fold,” or quit the contest, and limit their losses
to whatever they had already staked.

Discussion
Some of the oldest games in human memory are betting games, often
involving dice, and rather than try to recapitulate every type of betting game
and mechanism, we’ll restrict ourselves to how the mechanism is used in the
modern board-gaming context. Nevertheless, a field trip to your local casino
is highly recommended for extended study of these topics.
One common group of games that feature betting is trick-taking games,
like Tichu, where players place a “bet” by predicting the number of tricks they

210

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

will take. The role of betting in these designs is to allow players to self-balance
the outcomes of a random card deal. Players will bet more aggressively with a
stronger hand, Racing games like Camel Up offer wagering to allow players to
wager for the same reason. One might pedantically note that the game doesn’t
actually simulate or model camel racing as much as it models wagering on
camel races. Nevertheless, this is a very popular way for designers to make
games about racing, while sidestepping many of the challenges of modeling
an actual race.
The games above have wagering, without any real bluffing elements.
Conversely, there are games like Coup which feature bluffing, but not any
wagering. In Coup, players hold role cards that enable certain actions. These
cards are held in hand, as secret information, and a player can declare that
they possess any card, and take any connected action. As long as no player
challenges, the action occurs, but if a challenge is issued, the active player must
show the card they claimed and force the challenger to discard a role card,
or the player must discard one of their own role cards if they do not hold the
role card they claimed. Players who discard their last role cards are eliminated
from the game. This dynamic is present in many social deduction games,
which we discuss in a dedicated section (see “UNC-04” in this chapter).
Other games that are only about bluffing include Skull and Roses, Liar’s
Dice, Cockroach Poker and the classic game Cheat (which our saltier readers
may know by its more bovine name). What these games share in common
is that they have no currency to wager, and that when a player makes a
challenge, uncertainty exists only based upon player actions.
A key design element for including bluffing is hidden information, of course,
but also some form of information transmission. In poker, the information is
in the form of betting patterns, and the community cards visible on the table.
In Coup, the character a player chooses gives them special abilities. The actions
a player may perform based on the role give context to the choice, and the
possibility of the bluff. It is better if the hidden information doesn’t change
too frequently, to give a history to the choices a player makes. If the hidden
information constantly changes, it reduces the opportunities for players to try
to see through a bluff, leaving players with a random guessing game.
Bluffing is common in the party game space, but Wits & Wagers introduced
betting into the trivia genre. Players answer numbers-based questions and
arrange their numerical answers on a betting line in order from lowest to
highest. Players may then make two bets on which answer is closest to the
actual answer printed on the card. By cleverly allowing players to make two
wagers, the game expands from being only about how much confidence

Uncertainty

211

players have in their own knowledge to a richer set of choices. Players must
consider whether their wagers are revealing too much to their opponents,
while also looking to how other players bet to try and suss out likely answers
based on those betting patterns. If you’re playing with a doctor, for example,
you might follow their bets on biology and medical topics—until they catch
on to your strategy and lay a trap for you!
One of the most interesting places to find bluffing and wagering is in
modern resolution mechanisms for combat, some of which are discussed in
Chapter 4. In various games, players put forward some combination of known
strength, and some hidden amount of strength, and simultaneously reveal
and then resolve abilities to determine a winner. The hidden strength may
be represented by a number on a die, as in Tiny Epic Kingdoms, a leader card,
like in Dune, or a battle card, as in Kemet. Combat is entirely deterministic,
and all possible combat modifications are also known, such that in many
combats, players know which player will win if they spend their maximal
strength. The game is in out-thinking or out-guessing your opponent as to
how much strength he or she will spend. These combat systems are what we
might call all-pay, in that the committed resources are discarded. This is a key
distinction between auctions and wagers more generally: in auctions only the
winner pays, but in a wager, the losers pay.
The ability to read and out-guess your opponents, to know their minds,
is described by the Japanese word “Yomi.” Yomi is especially prominent
in games with a simultaneous reveal mechanism like 1v1 fighting games.
However, role-selection games (ACT-02) like Race for the Galaxy have this
flavor too: assessing which roles your opponents will select, and thus, which
you should select is the Yomi experience. In The Mind, that same notion is
pushed to the limit, but in a co-op game. In The Mind, players must, without
communicating, somehow play hands of cards in ascending numerical order.
There are no turns, and not all car ds are dealt from the deck, so players
must simply play based on their instincts and their ability to sense what their
partners might hold.

Push-Your-Luck

Description
Players must decide between settling for existing gains, or risking them all for
further rewards. Push-Your-Luck is also known as press-your-luck.

Discussion
A good example of a game whose central mechanism is Push-Your-Luck
is Sid Sackson’s Can’t Stop. In Can’t Stop, the active player rolls four dice
and advances up to two pawns in tracks numbered from 2 to 12, based on
matching the sum of any two dice to the numbers on the tracks. The player
may choose at any point to stop rolling, and lock in their progress along the
tracks, or reroll to attempt to advance again. However, if after rolling, the
player cannot match the sum of the dice to any of the three active tracks
the player is advancing on, the player “busts,” and all progress from that turn
is lost. Push-Your-Luck is a type of wager in which players have less control
over the ante or the stakes than in most casino games.

214

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

An important dynamic in push-your-luck games is how changes to the
stakes can alter player behavior. In Can’t Stop, when a player reaches the top
of any numbered track, the track is closed, and nobody else can score it. The
first player to reach the top of three tracks is the winner. Players may be more
timid at the start, but when one player is close to reaching the top of a track,
competitors also racing up that track usually become much more aggressive
and risk-tolerant, as they attempt to close the track themselves. This is doubly
so when a player is close to winning the game, and the other players try to
win it all themselves in one epic turn. When there’s nothing to lose, why not
press-your-luck?
Some of the behaviors and emotions that Sackson evokes in Can’t Stop
stems from behavior that echoes the sunk-cost fallacy, in which investing
additional resources into some goal is based not on the chances for succeeding,
or the expected return on the investment, but on an emotional connection
to what has already been invested in the past. In addition, Sackson is also
depending on the difficulty in computing probabilities in Can’t Stop. Avid
gamers, whether raised on Backgammon or Catan, are adept at calculating
probabilities featuring 2d6, but calculating the probabilities of successfully
rolling at least one of two or three different numbers on 4d6 is the kind of
thing that few players can do in their heads. This obfuscation is critical, since
games in which expected values can always be calculated exactly can feel stale
and boring.
Can’t Stop is unforgiving. A single miss, a single roll of the dice that fails to
advance a runner on a track, leads to a bust. In Yahtzee, players roll five dice,
and may choose to keep any number and reroll the rest before being forced
to score the results. However, players are limited to a total of three rolls. In
Favor of the Pharaoh there is an additional restriction that players must keep,
or lock, at least one die result before rerolling the remaining dice. In Tiny Epic
Galaxies players may spend a specific resource to purchase additional rerolls.
Alternatively, instead of focusing on the die roll, Push-Your-Luck can be
implemented in the chase for rewards. In Roll Through The Ages: The Iron
Age players race to build monuments, but the first player to complete the
monument will get a larger reward than all subsequent players. Players must
choose between participating in the race for monument completion, or
devoting their resources to a different pursuit. Similarly, in Incan Gold, (also
known by its original name, Diamant, which remains its European title)
players simultaneously choose whether to explore more deeply into a temple in
hopes of turning up more gems on the next turn of a card from the expedition
deck, or to leave. At first, there is no risk attached to staying in, but after the

Uncertainty

215

first of a type of hazard card is revealed the danger is that a matching hazard
will be revealed and all gems discovered will be lost. Players who leave early
get to retain all their gems gained so far, while players who remain will be
splitting new treasure with fewer players, making staying in the cave more
rewarding as well as riskier.
Formula De ties a player’s movement to gears represented by dice. Higher
gears allow players to roll dice with more sides, up to a D30 for top gear—
but curves offer a speed limit past which cars take damage. Take too much
damage and you’re out of the race!
Dice are a common means of implementing a press-your-luck mechanism,
but they are far from the only one, as per the aforementioned Incan Gold. In
Oh My Goods!, cards representing resources are played face-up into a market
row until two cards showing a half-sun icon are revealed. Players must assign
their workers after seeing one market row revealed, and can assign workers
to tasks that require more goods to be completed than are currently showing
in the market row. A second market row is then revealed, which may provide
sufficient resources for players to complete their work… or not! Notably,
the game allows players to assign workers to work in way that will yield the
maximum reward, which requires all resources be available, or to work for a
lesser reward, in which case a resource can be missing. This allows players to
choose the stakes and probabilities of their wager, while retaining the “bust”
outcome that characterizes these games.
Press-your-luck can be the central mechanism in a game, but it appears just
as frequently as a part of a larger game. In Ra, players draw tiles from a bag to
create an auction lot. Prior to each draw, the active player may call an auction,
but auctions are more often triggered when a Ra tile is drawn out of the bag.
There are multiple dimensions of luck-pressing baked into play: tiles are worth
different amounts to players based on a set-collection mechanism (see “Set
Collection” in Chapter 12), some tiles will impact players negatively, while
other tiles are highly desirable to all players. Drawing another tile instead
of calling the auction can radically change the overall value of the lots, and
change them differently for each player. Towards the end of the round, when
only one player remains, that player continues drawing tiles until he or she
wishes to stop and purchase the lot. However, if a Ra tile is drawn at this
point, the round ends immediately and the player loses his or her opportunity
to buy. It is not uncommon to hear chants of “Ra! Ra! Ra!” during this phase
of a game, demonstrating how meaningful the stakes feel in this masterpiece.
Ra’s Push-Your-Luck mechanism permeates the whole game, yet it is
clearly in service to the auction-and-set-collection core. In many games, the

216

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Push-Your-Luck element is a layer of flair rather than a core of the experience.
In Mystic Vale, a kind of deck-building game (see “CAR-05” in Chapter 13)
players flop cards to establish their mana pool for the turn, until three spoils
symbols are showing on the cards. Players may choose to risk flopping an
additional card to expand their mana pool, but if another spoils symbol
shows, the player busts and loses his or her turn. This mechanism is entirely
optional and additive, and players can play and win without ever engaging
in it, but it can be wisely leveraged to accelerate a deck’s construction too.
Push-Your-Luck as a mechanism is straightforward to understand, even
if the risks can be difficult to calculate, and it easily creates drama, tension,
and excitement. It should be considered an essential part of every designer’s
toolkit.

Hidden, trackable information whose tracking gives players an advantage.

Discussion
Memory can be a game mechanism, or a capability a player draws upon when
engaging with one or more mechanisms. It’s an important design ingredient, a
lever whose setting will have substantial impact on a game’s weight, intended
audience, and general reception. Our discussion will focus on games where
memory is at the center of the game design, rather than where memory is an
ancillary skill that the game tests.
Memory games can be seen on a spectrum. At one end, are games like
the classic game Memory and the modern game The Magic Labyrinth, in
which the only skill the core game mechanism tests is whether players can
remember things. In Memory, it’s the specific location of various items in the
face-down grid of tiles. In The Magic Labyrinth, players need to remember the
correct path through the maze, because the walls of the maze are invisible, and
the game uses magnets on the underside of the board to define that path.
Memoarrr! borrows a bit from both of these games, with cards that feature
two elements that must be remembered, and then arranged spatially.
Further down this spectrum are games where memory is crucial to the
core gameplay in patent and obvious ways. Stratego and Lord of the Rings:
The Confrontation feature player pieces on standees or blocks. These pieces
have unit information on only one side, such that players can’t see the identities
of opposing pieces before they encounter them. In an encounter, players reveal

the pieces, then flip them back, leaving the players to use their memories to
track the location and identity of the revealed pieces. These games have fairly
small and stripped-down rulesets that put the spotlight squarely on memory,
but block-style war games like Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan use this
same mechanism to add fog of war—the uncertainty of the disposition of
enemy forces that is typical in war.
This type of memory mechanism, sometimes called “Hidden Trackable
Information” (HTI), for short, challenges players to remember information
that was once revealed to them. We’ve discussed positional examples so far, but
those examples are perhaps the least polarizing. In Small World, players must
announce how many coins (i.e., victory points or VPs) they have collected
at the end of their turn, but not their total. It would be trivial to track this
information with a paper and pencil, but in the context of a fast-moving game
of territory control, it’s easy for players to lose track of who is ahead. This is
intentional on the part of the game designer! Small World is the successor
to Vinci, a Roman-themed game that is mechanically almost identical. One
key change between the two games was making the victory points hidden,
trackable information. This helped to prevent dynamics which plagued Vinci:
bash-the-leader behavior, and the extent to which players optimized their play
on the last turn. This change, along with cute art and a lighthearted feeling,
turned Small World into an evergreen success in the casual games space.
Another example of HTI is found in El Grande. In addition to placing
cubes onto the board, players may choose to place them into the Castillo, a
tall tower. Players cannot look in the Castillo, they need to remember how
many cubes are there. At the end of the round, each player secretly selects a
province in which to place his or her Castillo cubes. Remembering how many
cubes of each player are in the tower can be challenging—even remembering
how many of your own are in there can be difficult for players. But this lends
a fun, swingy punctuation to what otherwise is a very calculable game.
HTI can be especially controversial when it exists in more complex games,
but it is nonetheless common in 18xx games and other heavy economic or
auction games (see “Economics” in Chapter 7 and “Auctions” in Chapter 8,
respectively), where player or corporate cash holdings are hidden. To some
extent, this thematically reflects the ways in which corporations are secretive
about their finances. Mechanically, pricing an auction or predicting an
opponent’s actions is much simpler when the total money in the system is
known, and is even easier when the allocation of that money is known.
Memory and HTI sharply reduce accessibility and inclusion. To help players
who have trouble remembering, many games provide tracking components,

like Clue’s guessing pad. Other games provide some aid to memory, like Hunt
for the Ring, where the Nazgul players have a handful of tokens with different
markings that they can use as they wish. In Hanabi, the rules explicitly
encourage players to find a limit on communications that maximized the
fun for the group. This leaves open an enormous range of possibilities, from
playing Hanabi as a strict memory game where each individual must keep
track of his or her own hand, to one with almost no memory component since
players are free to remind one another what each of them has been clued to in
his or her own hands previously. Even under such rules, however, players must
remember when they were clued about the state of their hands, and which
new cards they have drawn since then.
Many games rely heavily on memory, even though they’re not explicitly
memory games, and players with better memory (or card-counting systems)
will have a substantial advantage. Trick-taking games and classic card games
in general fall into this category, since players who can remember which cards
have already been played can make better decisions about what to play next,
and the relative values of cards still in their hands. Another common dynamic
is games in which remembering the types of sets your opponent is collecting
allows you to interfere with them effectively, as in Animals On Board. In these
games, cards or tiles collected by players are hidden away after collection. These
are important design considerations, but they relate to memory as a player skill,
rather than as a game mechanism. Admittedly, the line between these two is
fuzzy, but we will wrap our discussion of memory mechanisms here.

Hidden Roles

Description
One or more players are assigned differing roles that are not publicly revealed
at the start of the game.

Discussion
While uncertainty lurks in many games, in Hidden Roles games, uncertainty
is at the very heart of the gameplay. We can broadly talk about three types of
Hidden Roles games: social deduction games, traitor games, and competing
roles games. We touched on this topic earlier in the chapter about game
structure (see Chapter 1). Social deduction games are team games in which
the object of gameplay is to deduce the team allegiances of the players, like
in the classic open-source game Mafia (which, ten years after its invention,
was recast as Werewolf ).
It’s worth noting that in these games, usually only one team faces uncertainty.
The werewolves know who all the villagers are, and as such, the werewolves
are playing a role-playing game whose win condition is to successfully deceive
the villagers for long enough to devour them. The villagers are playing a
deduction game where the evidence is mostly in the social interactions at
the table rather than the almost non-existent mechanical interactions. In
this section, we’ll generically refer to the “villagers” to represent the team,
typically positioned as the thematic protagonists, that has less knowledge of

Uncertainty

221

the game state, and “werewolves” to describe their opponents, who know the
identities of most or all players.
Shadow Hunters, Two Rooms and a Boom, and BANG! are exceptions to this
general rule. In these games, the players do not know the identities of any of
the other players (except for the Sheriff in BANG!, who is known to all). This
gives these games a different feel, as there is less paranoia, as all players are on
an equal footing, and an early part of the game is players trying to determine
who is on their team without tipping their hand.
Traitor games, as distinct from social deduction games, have some
other win condition for the “villager” side besides revealing the traitors.
In Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, players try to reach Korhol
(or some other destination), and the game operates like a cooperative game
(see “STR-02” in Chapter 1). However, a traitor may lurk among the players,
secretly sabotaging them. In traitor games, the traitor, upon discovery or
self-revelation, often shifts into a different role with a new win condition,
new actions, and different player powers.
Traitor games need to use hidden resolution systems so that players can
cause trouble while maintaining anonymity. In Battlestar, players play cards
face-down during the crisis phase, trying to sum up to a value of cards of a
certain color. Because the cards are played face-down, the traitor can sabotage
the crisis resolution effort without revealing himself or herself; although,
through deduction, the other players may start to uncover their identity. Dark
Moon has players roll dice behind a screen. Each player must select one die to
use to resolve the action. Traitors may use their worst rolls so as not to benefit
the team, but showing a bad roll does not guarantee a traitor, as a loyal player
may just have a bad roll and have no good dice to choose from.
In our final category, competing roles games, players are not on fixed teams,
and have hidden identities, but revealing those identities is not directly tied to
winning or losing. Ravenous River and Coup are examples of competing roles
games. In Ravenous River, each player is secretly assigned one of seven animal
identities. Animals eat one other type of animal and are in turn eaten by one
other type. Players use cards to manipulate the positions of any animals, not
just their animal, seeking to end the round in the same region as their prey
and not their predator. Deducing the identities of the other players can help
in executing a strategy, but isn’t worth any points towards victory.
The uncertainty in all of these types of games is not the operational
uncertainty of attempting an outcome without knowing whether it will
succeed, but it still is a kind of output randomness that injects noise between
a player’s intention and the results of his or her action. In Mascarade, player

222

roles can move around from player to player, such that a player may not know
what role he or she has at any given time, which creates a lot of uncertainty.
Like in Coup, players can claim the actions associated with any role, but
unlike in Coup, roles can get shuffled and players may not look at their own
role cards freely; they must spend their turn doing so.
An important source of uncertainty in social deduction games in particular
is in the unstructured conversation during which players discuss potential
targets and coordinate for the upcoming resolution phase, typically a vote.
The conversation phase offers players opportunities to lie, obfuscate, bluff,
posture, or hide in a shroud of silence. Experientially, this phase is crucial,
and whether players enjoy this genre of game rests largely on how much they
enjoy this part of the game.
Some games attempt to enforce some structure in the discussion phase, by
creating mechanisms with in-game consequences that players must grapple
with. In Salem 1692, players play action cards on one another that impact
status and abilities, including accusation cards that operate in place of the
voting phase of other social deduction games. In Shadow Hunters players
give cards with yes/no questions to other players, which they must answer.
In Ravenous River, as mentioned above, a player may have the opportunity
to manipulate the positions of a few animals, including animals other than
themselves. These actions, and their potential point-scoring consequences,
provide evidence of the player’s secret identity. This is related to hidden endgame goals (VIC-06).
We’ve touched briefly on Werewolf in its most basic form. However, its most
popular commercial iterations, such as Ultimate Werewolf, and The Resistance:
Avalon, feature a dizzying array of additional roles, each of which change the
dimensions and possibilities of gameplay. Some roles offer players additional
private information about other players and their roles or team identities.
Others can protect players from being eliminated, which injects performative
uncertainty into the elimination action. Some roles provide an elimination
power, which can be helpful to the “villager” side, but might actually cloud
the situation and make it more difficult to assess who the “werewolves” are
because players don’t know which team eliminated which players.
There’s much more to be said about the various types of roles possible
in these kinds of games, which is beyond the scope of this work. However,
one role is critical to consider: the role of the moderator. In many social
deduction games, the need to hide substantial aspects of the game state from
a shifting set of audiences makes these games inherently fragile and subject
to inadvertent revealing of information, or even tolerance for some mild

Uncertainty

223

cheating. Because these games also have unstructured conversation phases,
driving the game towards conclusion can sometimes be difficult. That’s why
many of these games call for a moderator who does not play the game, at
least in the sense that the moderator can neither win nor lose, but simply
administrates the game, and especially enforces time limits, whether formal
and agreed upon or informal and socially accepted.
Since the moderator is the only person who knows the complete game
state, playing as the moderator can be quite appealing to players who
enjoy spectating and people-watching. The moderator role can also be
performed with theatricality, and has an element of role-playing that sits
in its own layer of game-engagement that is separate from the core game
engine. And of course, like any refereeing role, the moderator can have both
unintentional and intentional impacts on the course of the game through
their manipulation of soft power, like when to call a discussion to a close
and insist on a vote.
Perhaps for these reasons, the moderator role has been eliminated in
many modern designs. In One Night Ultimate Werewolf, a prerecorded voice,
run by an app, takes players through the paces of each round, such that
a moderator is not required. In Dracula’s Feast, both the moderator and
the idea of player elimination are removed, and players have asymmetric
win conditions, some of which are not tied to discovering other players,
but to being accused of inhabiting certain roles. These differences put the
game firmly into the competing roles category, rather than social deduction
category. In order to get around the problem of sharing information
secretly, players each have a “Yes” and “No” card that they can show to the
one player asking them a question. These games can often have multiple
players winning by fulfilling different conditions. Two Rooms and a Boom
is particularly instructive in this area.
Voting-based player elimination is very common in social deduction
games, and that mechanism can create negative social consequences. From
the perspective of a cultural critic, these games are intended to recreate
uncomfortable social and political realities like mob justice, betrayal, and
schoolyard cliques. Some games lean into these dynamics, like Secret Hitler,
which not only requires that players step into a magic circle where they may
have to self-identify as a Nazi, or as Hitler himself, but must also participate in
a morally gray universe in which even non-Fascists might pass Fascist policies.
Designers need to take care that players understand the nature of the magic
circle that they’re stepping into, and what might be expected of them in their
suspension of real-world rules during play.

Roles with Asymmetric Information

Description
One or more players are secretly assigned roles at the start of the game which
have different win conditions, and receive different starting information
about the game state.

Discussion
In Hidden Roles (UNC-04) we speak of games where the “werewolves” have
complete or nearly complete knowledge of the identities of the other players.
The opposite dynamic is also possible, where the “werewolf” may know the
identities of the other players, but is missing some other critical information
that all the other players share. Generally, the goal for the “werewolf” is to
figure out that secret, and the goal for the “villagers” is to both keep that
secret safe and to guess the identity of the “werewolf.” In some games, one
or the other is sufficient to secure the victory for the “villagers” and in others
both are required.
In Spyfall, for example, players are told that they are at one of many
potential locations. One player, the spy, doesn’t know the location, but their
identity as the spy is hidden from the other players. The spy attempts to

226

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

deduce the location all the players are at, while the other players attempt to
figure out who the spy is, through asking and answering questions related in
some way to the location. Non-spy players must be careful to ask and answer
in a way that signals only to other players that they know the location, without
giving it away to the spy. The spy must ask and answer questions in a manner
that doesn’t draw suspicion, even though they don’t know where they are!
Another example that introduces a third role with Asymmetric Information
is A Fake Artist Goes to New York. In this game, the moderator is a player, and
also wins or loses. The moderator chooses both a category and the secret word
within the category, and chooses who the fake artist will be by revealing only
the category to them, but not the secret word. The other players then each
begin play, adding one line to a shared drawing on their turn, attempting to
signal to other players that they know what the secret word is.
Similar to Spyfall, the players don’t want to give away what they’re drawing,
since the fake artist wins if they can guess the secret word. The moderator is
aligned with the fake artist, and is thus incentivized to choose a category and
word that will make it easy for the fake artist to correctly guess the word.
The moderator is the only player at the table with complete knowledge of the
game state.
There is a genre of games which leverages this same type of informational
asymmetry, but with less emphasis on player roles. For example, games in
which cards or tiles are held facing out, like Hanabi and Abracada… What?,
don’t put players into different roles, but each player is denied knowledge of
only their own hand. Each of these is subtly different: Abracada… What? is
closest to Spyfall in that each player faces the tension of acting despite ignorance,
but there is no doubt as to the player’s identity or goals in the game from the
perspective of the other players. Hanabi is cooperative, and the dramatic irony
that the inactive players feel because they can see the active player’s hand as
they agonize over the right play is part of what makes that game special.
The mass-market game Headbanz, in which one player tries to guess at
a word on a card that all the other players can see, leverages this type of
hidden information that isolates a single player, whether for the whole game
or just for their turn, through sharp informational asymmetry. So does the
