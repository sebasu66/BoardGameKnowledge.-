AI-based games attempt to recreate the multiplayer experience by
introducing an automated player or players. Typically, this means some basic
algorithm governs the moves of the AI player. These systems can be challenging
to design, and usually depend on dice, cards or other randomizers to create
uncertainty about the AI player’s choices. However, other approaches to AI
opponents are also possible, as shown by Morten Monrad Pederson’s Automa
system, which powers solo modes in games as varied as Scythe, Anachrony,
Baseball Highlights 2045, and Between Two Cities.
Pederson’s Automa system is more a philosophy and approach than an
official system, and many designers have used its principles to create Automas.
The key principles are that the solo game should feel as much as possible like
the multiplayer game, and that AIs should be representational, rather than
procedural. The AI doesn’t observe the rules and doesn’t play the game as a
player might. Rather, the AI is a series of outputs that are applied to the game
state that mimic the outputs that result from a human player’s choices—a
kind of Potemkin player. In Pederson’s words, the AI is only the shell of a
human player, and while the humans in a game of Viticulture have vineyards
and grow grapes, the Automa players do not; they just give the impression
that they do. In practice, Automas will claim action spaces, draft cards, block
routes, and otherwise interfere with human players, but they will not collect
resources, build buildings, or score victory points.
Solo games are enjoyed by a large, active, and growing community who
continues to homebrew solo versions of multiplayer games, host contests and
challenges, and enjoy an unexpected comradery despite the solitary nature
of their pastime. Increasingly, including a solo mode is a desirable feature for
published multiplayer games, and the success of a number of solo-only games,

like Friday and Hostage Negotiator, has established that there is a market even
for the loneliest of player counts.

Semi-Cooperative Games

Description
A game which ends with either no winners or with the players winning as a
group, but a single player being recognized as the individual winner as well.

Discussion
Semi-cooperative games are like cooperative games because players can all lose
together to the game itself. However, if the players manage to overcome the
game, one of the players will be crowned the individual victor, or a kind of
most valuable player, based on some in-game achievement. A group’s enjoyment
of this style of game depends on all members having the same answer to the
question of whether a group win, coupled with an individual loss, is in fact
superior to a total group loss. If players are split on this question, those for whom
an individual loss is as bad as a group loss will not seek optimal cooperative plays,
and may even sabotage the group while trying to secure a winning individual
position. Players who prefer to win as a group, even if they lose as individuals,
will be incensed by this conduct, and unhappiness will follow for everyone.
There’s a strong connection between semi-cooperative games and roleplaying games (RPGs). RPGs typically feature a similar dynamic: all players
want to follow the main plot narrative and defeat the big bad, but each player
has individual motivations that may sometimes work at cross-purposes,
and in any case, each player is motivated to secure the greatest in-game
rewards in terms of wealth, experience points, glory, etc. These competing
motivations can help weave a complex and gripping narrative. In tabletop

16

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

games, a semi-cooperative structure can create memorable moments of lastsecond betrayal and competitive jockeying for position.
Semi-cooperative games are fascinating as a design study because of
how players engage with them. Many groups will play semi-cooperatives as
co-ops, ignoring the individual win conditions, or treating them as a means
for recognizing a great performance by some player, rather than as a win
condition to be claimed. Others will embrace the notion of an individual
win and engage in brinksmanship in almost total violation of the cooperative
element of the game. Despite the broad range of possible play styles, each
group typically has a very narrow idea of the “right way” to play the game. In
other words, it’s unlikely that the same group would play Arkham Horror as a
total co-op one night, and then as a semi-co-op another night. Actually, you
might be hard-pressed to find anyone who plays Arkham Horror with any care
for the individual win condition. The game holds little attraction for players
looking for that experience. Crafting a semi-co-op that is satisfying to play
and that manages to incentivize both the individual and cooperative aspects
of the game is like trying to land a jet plane in a phone booth.
Another route a designer can consider is introducing cooperative elements
into a competitive game without creating a cooperative loss condition. Games
like Kingsburg and Survive: Escape from Atlantis achieve this in different ways.
In Kingsburg, all players must face a common foe at the end of each year.
In Survive, players can share common resources like lifeboats to escape the
ocean’s dangers. These cooperative opportunities can enrich the game and
create internal drama without confusing players as to their incentives, or
causing distress over what type of game players they thought they sat down to.

Single Loser Games

Description
A game with three or more players which ends with only one loser.

Discussion
Games with one loser flip the script by incentivizing players not to perform
better than everyone else, but better than at least one other person. Like the
old saw about not needing to outrun a ravenous bear, these games emphasize
impeding other players more than advancing yourself. Old Maid is a wellknown classic card with this structure. Alcatraz: The Scapegoat is a modern
game in which players are escaping prison, but one of them, the scapegoat,
will remain behind and lose.
Stacking games often feature a single-loser structure, because many of
them end when a player knocks over the shared structure. Jenga and Rhino
Hero are examples of this dynamic, though Rhino Hero does offer some rules
for determining who the winner is among the surviving players. In practice
though, groups often ignore this final scoring, or even scoring of any kind.
Single-loser structures are not very common in modern games, perhaps
because they encourage sharply confrontational “take-that” play in which
players can directly impede or harm one another. These structures can also be
susceptible to a bash-the-loser pattern, in which the player who falls behind
becomes the most attractive target to all other players, and has no chance to
recover their position. This structure represents an innovation horizon for
designers to explore.

Traitor Games

Description
A traitor game can be seen as a kind of team game, or as a cooperative game
with a betrayal mechanism. The traitors typically win by triggering a failure
condition for the players. For our purposes, a traitor game is characterized by
traitors that begin the game with hidden identities.

Discussion
Traitor games sit at the overlap in the Venn diagram of social deduction
games, team games, and cooperative games. The cooperative game engine sets
the overall parameters for how players interact in the game, and those choices
provide information that players can use and manipulate to deduce, accuse,
and mislead. The team element provides coordination options for both sides,
both out loud and in secret. These designs must add a layer of obfuscation in
order to preserve uncertainty and mystery. Thus, in Dead of Winter the cards
contributed by players to meeting the current crisis are shuffled prior to being
revealed, so as to hide which player contributed which card.
In designing traitor games, it’s important to consider how the game plays at
different stages of knowing the traitor’s identity. The tension and suspense of
not knowing who is on which side is great fuel for the beginning of the game,
but once the traitor has been sussed out, is the game still fun? Does the traitor
still have meaningful and interesting choices? Is catching the traitor a victory

20

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

condition itself? Betrayal at House on the Hill is a traitor game with many story
modules, each with its own mechanisms, that designers can treat it as a case
study on this exact issue.
Another challenge facing traitor games is learnability. Like in team or One
vs. All games, players have to learn how all the sides work to play properly.
In traitor games with hidden identities, players can’t readily ask questions or
consult the rules without giving away their loyalties. Good player aids and
reference material need to be areas of focus.

Scenario/Mission/Campaign Games

Description
This is a game system that can be applied to a variety of different maps,
starting resources and positions, and even different win and loss conditions.
These variable conditions can be assembled into a broader narrative or
campaign, or they can be entirely disconnected from one another.

Discussion
The roots of scenario-based games are in storytelling, history, wargames
and RPGs. The idea is that a rich experience can be woven out of multiple
episodes, planned out to be experienced sequentially.
In wargames like Advanced Squad Leader, the same core system, together
with substantial supplements, enables players to model an enormous variety of
possible conflicts. As players gain mastery, they can attempt more challenging
and complex scenarios. At the other end of the spectrum, a war-themed game
like Memoir ’44 gives players the opportunity to play the many battles and
confrontations that made up the D-Day invasion with an intuitive ruleset that
can be taught in ten minutes.

22

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Scenario structures are popular in dungeon crawler games. Swap in a new
dungeon map, a new boss monster, maybe some new mission types, and
players can enjoy new challenges without learning new rules. Scenarios can
also be completely detached from any narrative, and simply allow players to
face off against one another in a skirmish mode that provides some basic rules
for force construction. Scenarios are also prevalent in cooperative settings,
both for offering different levels of difficulty and for creating variety.
Recently, there has been an explosion in the types of games offering a
scenario or campaign structure. Catan expansions going back as far as Seafarers
of Catan have offered scenario play, but hits like The 7th Continent, Mechs
vs. Minions, Near and Far, and card-based dungeon crawlers like Pathfinder
Adventure Card Game and Gloomhaven have rocketed in popularity. It’s also
impossible not to mention T.I.M.E Stories and the various escape room game
series like Exit: The Game, Unlock!, and Deckscape. Though each box is a
self-contained experience, the play system is largely similar from box to box,
and outside of the packaging and business model, these games are scenariobased in structure. One might even consider Age of Steam maps, Power Grid
expansions, Ticket to Ride standalone variants from Europe to New York,
Pandemic: Iberia and Cthullhu, and the Mystery Rummy series as follow-on
scenarios, sold separately.

Score-and-Reset Games

Description
This is a game in which players play until reaching a stopping condition, then
record scores, reset the game, and play one or more additional rounds. The
game concludes after some number of rounds, and the cumulative score is
calculated to determine a winner.

Discussion
Score-and-reset is a very common game structure that is well represented
among classic games from Bridge to Backgammon, and in modern games like
Red7, Ravenous River, and Incan Gold.
Card games are especially amenable to this structure, which matches well
with playing out a hand of cards, shuffling and redealing. Games with a
strong turn-order advantage can take advantage of a score-and-reset structure
by having players take turns in the lead position, and using cumulative scoring
to measure who played best over a series of rounds.
Stacking games like Rhino Hero use score-and-reset because once the
shared structure is toppled, there’s a need to collect up the cards and pieces
anyway, and this represents a natural end point. Whether players do in fact

24

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

record wins and losses or points is to some extent a matter of the dynamics of
the game group itself. By contrast, dexterity games like KLASK and BONK
reset after each goal, but scoring is rigorously tracked.
Score-and-reset structures can be somewhat informal. Players might play
a series of games of Hive and declare a victor after one player reaches some
total number of victories. There’s not a sharp line between score-and-reset and
round structure in general. Amun-Re features two ages, in which gameplay is
identical, but the board itself does not fully reset. Pyramids built in the first
age persist in the second age, and influence valuation of territories. In Blue
Lagoon, the board is reset between the first and second half of the game, with
the exception of the huts players lay out in the first half. However, the rules
of placement change profoundly too—where players were free to lay explorers
on any sea space in the first half, in the second half, they must begin laying
explorers adjacent to their huts.

Legacy Games

m
ase

Description
A legacy game is a multisession game in which permanent and irreversible
changes to the game state carry over from session to session.

Discussion
The first legacy game, Rob Daviau’s Risk Legacy, came from the unlikeliest
of places: Hasbro. Daviau, by his telling, half-shepherded, half-snuck the
audacious design past the gatekeepers at the company, and emerged with a
genre-defining hit. Famously, the game was sealed with a sticker that had to
be broken to open the box, and which warned ominously, “What is Done
Cannot Be Undone.” This irreversible permanent change is what legacy games
are all about.
As of this writing, there are still relatively few legacy games on the market.
They are difficult to playtest, require generating quite a lot of content, and

26

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

are tricky to produce and price properly. Curmudgeons will rightly point out
that RPGs and campaign games are essentially legacy games, except that you
don’t have to destroy your game as you play. Yet that permanent destruction,
the tearing of a card or writing on a board generates a visceral response that
those other games don’t. Breaking this taboo and permanently altering a game
can be a stressful and cathartic experience at the same time.
Legacy games aren’t simply about destroying components and defacing
boards. Another element common to these games is unlocks: gated content
that can only be opened and accessed after some condition is met. We’ll
refrain from specific examples, so as not to spoil these experiences for the
uninitiated! Unlocks differ fundamentally from gated content in non-legacy
games (see “Gating and Unlocking” in Chapter 3) in that unlocks usually
occur at game-end, their impacts will only be felt in the next session, and
these unlocks are typically not simply buffs and de-buffs to existing statistics,
but rather, entire new mechanisms, characters, factions, maps, etc. These
unlocks can also radically change the narrative or move the camera and offer
players new perspective and surprises.
Like campaign games, legacy games require a substantial commitment to
complete, and they typically call for the same group to come together ten or
more times. Pandemic Legacy can theoretically take 24 sessions to complete!
Publishers, and thus designers, can feel trapped between offering a novel and
essentially unrepeatable experience on the one hand, while still providing
sufficient re-playability to players, despite the consumable nature of the game.
Most legacy games do allow players to keep playing the game even after the
campaign is concluded, but anecdotally, it seems that few players do so.
It appears, from this early vantage point on this emerging trend, that the
market is expanding to allow for a broader range of possible games, such that
at the right price point, even a single-play game like the Exit series can be a hit.
Games like the Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle deck-building game have used
unlocks, but not destructibility, and are fully resettable. Gloomhaven takes a
similar approach with reusable stickers to provide changes that are campaignpermanent, but otherwise reversible. Fabled Fruit is even more easily reset,
requiring nothing more than reordering a deck of cards. However, it is difficult
to distinguish it structurally from, say, a deck-building game in which any
given play session may include a completely different subset of cards.
Legacy games are a still-emerging category and definition. Elements we’ve
identified may not exist in every game, and new elements may yet emerge,
especially as legacy games and digital apps converge. Stay tuned for more
changes in this exciting new genre.

Turn Order and Structure

ӶӶ
One of the elements that separates “games” from “play” is the introduction
of structure. This takes many forms, including restrictions on how players
perform activities and when they may perform them. Out of this arises the
concept of a “turn”—an order or structure within which players take their
actions.
The concept of taking turns is one of the first game-based concepts taught
to young children. Many simple games, like Candyland, exist for the purpose
of teaching how to wait for your turn, among other early building blocks of
how to play games.
The turn structure of a game can set the tone for the entire experience,
whether it is playful, strategic, or intense. Selecting the appropriate turn
structure for the game is an important part of the design process.
This section includes a wide variety of these structures, including some
that, while appearing unstructured, like real-time games, actually contain
their own internal structure, logic, and design challenges.

29

30

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

Terminology
For this book we have adopted the following commonly used terminology
when describing turn structure:
A Turn is typically one player taking a series of Actions or Steps, although
sometimes other players may interrupt or otherwise participate.
A Round is composed of multiple Turns. This can be a fixed number of
turns, or variable depending on player actions or random events.

For example, Agricola consists of 14 Rounds. In each Round there is a Start
Player, who takes the first Turn. During that Turn, they perform two Steps:
Placing a worker, and performing the Actions designated by the space where
the worker is placed. Players continue to take Turns in clockwise order until
all workers have been placed. This concludes the Round.
There may be activities that take place at the beginning or end of a Round.
For example, in Agricola you may need to feed your workers, or new Actions
may be added to the available options.
Many games also introduce the concept of a Phase. Phases can be inserted
at different places in the hierarchy depending on the needs of the designer.
For example, a Round can consist of several Phases, and each Phase can have

Turn Order and Structure

31

a series of Turns. Or a series of Rounds may make up a Phase. The section on
Interleaved vs. Sequential Structures (TRN-15) discusses this in more detail.
The key distinguishing feature of Phases vs. Rounds or Turns is that there
are usually multiple Phases, and each is named with a different and specific
purpose. For example, there may be a “Feeding Phase” and a “Scoring Phase,”
and those can be radically different from each other. In contrast, Rounds
and Turns are rarely distinguished in this way. They are identical in their
basic structure. This is not to say that each Turn, for example, always consists
of exactly the same Steps. Many games give players a choice of actions to
perform. But a turn performed by one player is typically very similar in
structure, if not identical, to another player’s turn.
Some games also have levels above Rounds. These have a variety of names,
from the generic Stage in Die Speicherstadt to the more thematic Age in
Through the Ages.
Obviously, all of this terminology is not written in stone, and there will be
esoteric structures that may require different names. However, anything that is
outside what players are expecting, or inverting this customary order, will add
cognitive load to the players, both in learning and playing. You can build a car
that puts the windshield wiper controls underneath the radio instead of on a
steering wheel stalk, or make a new icon to represent the defrosters, but new
drivers will find it more challenging to drive. Eventually they will adapt, but the
best approach is to keep to conventions unless there is a strong reason not to do so.

Fixed Turn Order

Description
Turn order is set at the start of the game and never varies. Each player takes
a turn in the same sequence until the end of the game.

Discussion
A Fixed Turn Order is the most basic turn order, one that we are introduced
to from the first games we play at a young age. Typically, play proceeds
from a starting player clockwise around the table; however, Asian games
often proceed counter-clockwise. In this book we will assume that games
proceed clockwise (Progressive or Become First Player Action, for example).
We recommend that the direction match the cultural norm to reduce the
cognitive load on players.
Fixed Turn Order will often result in an imbalance favoring one of
the player positions (typically the first player, but sometimes the last). To
compensate, the designer may give a bonus to the other players. This can be
extra or better resources, as in Century: Spice Road, bonus victory points, as
in Go, or other advantages.
Another concern is ensuring players will have an equal number of turns.
A common means for addressing this is using a token or indication of which
player went first. When the game-ending condition is triggered, the round
continues, the marker serving as a reminder of which players should still take
a turn so that all players will have the same number of turns. Century: Spice
Road uses this system, for example.
These systems may introduce additional complexity and design
considerations, however. For example, some players may have their final turn
before they know that the game is ending, while others may have theirs after,
and be able to optimize their play. Let’s say there are five players: A through
E, with A being the first player. If player C triggers the end of the game,

Turn Order and Structure

33

D and E will get one final turn, then the game will end. This may give D
and E an advantage over A and B, as they definitely know this is their final
turn and can execute accordingly.
Through the Ages uses a Fixed Turn structure, and keeps track of the first
player. However, to help counteract the issue that some but not all players
know what their last turn is, it sometimes extends an extra round, depending
on when the end is triggered. If game-end is triggered on the first player’s
turn, the current round would be the final round. If game-end is triggered on
any other player’s turn, the game goes on for another full round. This helps
mitigate the situation, but it does add additional complexity to the rules.

Stat Turn Order

Description
The turn order within each Round is set by some statistic relating to the
players’ resources or position in the game.

Discussion
This Stat Turn Order mechanism gives the designer an additional tool to work
with, particularly to implement a Catch the Leader mechanism (VIC-18).
Frequently the resource that is used as the basis for turn order is Victory Points
(VIC-01), where the player in last place goes first in the turn order, or possibly
last. However, it can be other resources or board states. In Civilization, for
example, it is based on the number of population tokens a player has on
the board.
Turn order may also be variable for different phases of the game, based on
different statistics. Both Power Grid and Civilization use this method. Power
Grid always uses the number of connected cities as the ranking metric, but
in some phases the player with the most connected cities goes first, and in
others they go last. During the auction for power plants, the player in the
lead must select and bid on the first power plant, which is disadvantageous.
When purchasing resources and building power lines, the player in the lead
goes last, resulting in more expensive resources or possibly getting blocked
out of places to build. In Civilization, some phases are sequenced by Census
(population tokens), while others are based on the victory track, either forward
or reverse. This gives the designer fine-grained control over balance and the
relative importance of different aspects. It also allows players to manipulate
turn order, and gives the designer a tool to implement a Catch the Leader
mechanism.
A word of caution is in order if Victory Points are used as the turn order (as
in Power Grid), but many Victory Points are awarded at the end of the game,

Turn Order and Structure

35

or are otherwise not tallied on the Victory Point (VP) track immediately
(VIC-06). Those “off-the-book” VPs have the added benefit of not hurting
a player’s turn order positioning. If players who are ahead on the score track
during the game are penalized by turn order, it will give increased weight to
strategies around end-game points, which the designer needs to consider for
balance.
When the advantages of turn order are extreme, manipulating turn order
may become a dominant feature of game play, which may or may not match
the designer’s intent. For example, in Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, a
simulation of the European theater of World War II, turn order is determined
by the production output of the sides (called Basic Resource Points, or BRPs).
Typically, it is clear which side has more BRPs, and the turn order stays fixed.
However, at critical points the lead may change, resulting in a double turn,
as the player that moved last in one turn moves first in the next. Players have
some control over BRPs, as a portion of those not spent carry over to the next
turn, and conquests, strategic warfare, and other effects may impact it, so
paying close attention to this stat is vital.
This is clearly part of the design intent. In the early stages of the game,
Germany will typically move first, but as the United States enters the war and
gains in economic strength there will inevitably be a transition resulting in
Allied double move, which can strongly shift momentum in their favor. The
Axis player tries to blunt this by controlling the timing of when this double
move occurs, perhaps triggering it earlier than the Allied player wants, and
when they are not set up to take advantage of it.

Bid Turn Order

Description
Players bid for turn order. A variety of auction mechanisms may be used
(see “Auctions” in Chapter 8 for more details).

Discussion
Adding an auction for turn order, or Bid Turn Order, helps improve balance
by allowing the players to decide the relative merits of different turn orders at
different times and situations. However, there are several drawbacks to this
method. First, it will slow the game down. Auctions in general can add a lot
of time to the game and can feel tacked-on when the auction is not integrated
into the core game mechanism. This is normally the case with auctioning off
turn order, which is usually a prelude to the main gameplay.
Age of Steam has a traditional Turn Order Until Pass auction (AUC-03).
While the auction can be long, turn order in this game is very important,
and the rules of the bid have additional tactical considerations, since players
who drop out early get all or some of their bids back. In a tight economic
game like Age of Steam, the bidding is extremely tense and important, and the
experience more than makes up for the game length.
In A Game of Thrones, players bid for turn order via the Throne track. In
addition to being first player, the highest bidder on the Throne track also gains
the ability to break any ties that occur. Giving an extra benefit to the auction
makes it more interesting to the players, and raises the stakes of the bidding.
Another game that uses this mechanism is El Grande, where the playing
of Power Cards determines the turn order. Each player has Power Cards
numbered 1–20, and selects one (selection is made based on the turn order of
the prior turn). Each player may only play each Power Card once per game,
and they may not play the same Power Card as one that another player has
played during that round. These rules speed the auction for turn order. In an

Turn Order and Structure

37

example of elegant design, the Power Cards determine not just turn order, but
the number of pieces (“caballeros”) that are made available to the player for
the Area Majority competition (ARC-02) featured in the game. Power cards
are designed to offer better turn order and fewer caballeros, or vice versa.
Timing their play is a critical part of El Grande and makes the turn-order
auction step more engaging.
Auctions do suffer from another weakness, though. Auctions rely on
players understanding the value of what they are bidding on. When bidding
for resources or something tangible, it is easier for new players to judge relative
worth. However, turn order is a much more nebulous concept for new players,
and determining its value can be very tricky. This can lead to players over- or
under-paying in the auction, which can lead to balance issues and lessened
enjoyment. Therefore, if using a bid for turn order, it is recommended that
designers give players guidelines for typical early game bids to help them bid
appropriately.
Bid Order turn systems typically require a physical element to track turn
order—a track, tokens, cards, something to indicate the sequence. Because
turn order does not go “around the table,” this system can result in delays as
players get confused, or need to check a secondary track, to determine whose
turn it is.

Progressive Turn Order

Description

One player has the First Player token. At the end of the round, the token
passes to the player to the left who becomes the new First Player for that
round. During the round, players take turns clockwise around the table.

Discussion
There are several advantages to the Progressive Turn Order system over the Fixed
Turn Order (TRN-01) structure. First, it naturally rotates the first player marker
through the players in a predictable way. This enables planning on the part of the
players, plus it introduces a timing element. If you are going second, you know
that you will be going first the next round and can plan accordingly.
Similarly, being first in a round is immediately followed by being last in the
next round. This gives a nice rhythm to the game, as over a series of rounds
you move closer and closer to going first, and then slip to last place. It’s a
gradual buildup, followed by a sharp drop.
The above assumes, of course, that going first is the best position, and going
last the worst. In some games the opposite is true, like Texas Hold’Em Poker.
In this game the first position is typically considered the worst, while the last,
“the button,” is the best, as seeing what other players do before you make your
decision gives more information to work with. So in Texas Hold’Em Poker,
once the player is in the best position, the button, they gradually move closer
and closer to the worst position, the small blind. Then the player jumps from
being in the worst position to the best.

Turn Order and Structure

39

Progressive games can leave a large gap between player turns. For example,
in a five-player game when a player moves first, the next round he or she will
move fifth. That means that it will be nine turns until the player gets to go
again (eight opponent turns). Depending on the game, this can lead to serious
downtime. For this reason, Progressive is most effective in games with short
turns, or where players take actions during other player turns. The latter is
done in Puerto Rico, where the other players get to perform a less powerful
version of the action selected by the main player (ACT-08).
Typically, games that use Progressive Turn structure are played to the end of
the round in which the end game condition is triggered. Therefore, the issue with
players having an unequal number of turns does not arise as it does in Fixed Turn
Order games. Sometimes a mechanism is included to ensure that each player has
the same number of opportunities to go first (often by setting the number of
rounds equal to the number of players, or a multiple of that number).
A less-used variant on Progressive Turn structure is Regressive, where the
First Player token passes counter-clockwise, while turns are taken clockwise.
Much of the discussion in Progressive applies here, in terms of psychology
and gaps between turns. However, there is one important difference: in a
Regressive structure, the player who goes last in one round will go first in the
next. Players having two turns in a row can be extremely powerful, particularly
when a player knows it is happening and can plan accordingly. The game
needs to be designed and structured to either take advantage of that or blunt it
in some fashion. For example, in Dead of Winter, a semi-cooperative potential
hidden traitor game (STR-05), the hidden traitors would do well to reveal
themselves to be the traitors in the round in which they go last, as they will
have two successive turns in which to wreak havoc.
Regressive is unintuitive to players, because so many games go clockwise.
Having a turn which moves clockwise, but a token which moves counterclockwise, is an additional cognitive burden that should only be imposed for
some specific design reason.

Claim Turn Order

Description
In each round there is a First Player, and turns are taken clockwise from the
first player. There is an action that may be taken to claim a place in the turn
order (typically, but not always, first) for the next round, with play proceeding
clockwise from the First Player. If no one takes the action, turn order remains
unchanged.

Discussion
Similar to Stat Turn Order (TRN-02), Claim Turn Order Action gives more
control to the players over the turn order, as they need to do something to
seize control over the first player marker.
Caution and finesse need to be employed by the designer when using this
system, as there are a number of pitfalls. This technique is often used in Worker
Placement (Chapter 9) or Action Drafting (ACT-02) games, and players will
need to use one of their workers or actions to go first next time. This means
that they are sacrificing something to gain that advantage. Balancing the
cost can be tricky as the value of going first can be variable from situation to

42

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

situation, and player to player. The value of simply going first may not be that
great, so players may avoid using an action to be first player. In this case, the
same player gets to remain first player without losing an action. They simply
remains first player by default.
Designers can sweeten the value of claiming turn order by including other
resources or abilities with it. For example, in Agricola, the player who chooses
the First Player action may also play a Minor Improvement.
More importantly, the player to the left of the player who chooses to go
first gets a great boon. They will get to play second, which, while not as good
as going first, was obtained with absolutely no effort on their part. Agricola
suffers quite a bit from this issue, as it is of great benefit to be to the left of the
player who chose to go first, and frustrating to be the player to the right, who
will now go last, through no fault or action of their own.
First Class: All Aboard the Orient Express deals with this issue by giving
bonuses to all positions when the First Player token is chosen as an action.
In a four-player game, the player who chose to go first gains two coins, the
third player may take a Train Card, and the fourth player may either take or
upgrade a Train Card. The player who will now be going second receives no
bonus—being able to go second in the round while not giving anything up
is deemed sufficient compensation. The First Class system gives the designer
a lot of flexibility in balancing the different player positions.
Another pitfall to avoid is scripted play—obviously-best moves by players.
In earlier editions of the game Twilight Imperium, players chose an Action
card on their turn to perform. One of them gave a Victory Point to the player
choosing it, which was very powerful, and another let a player become First
Player. Because the free Victory Point card was so strong, play almost always
followed a scripted pattern. The first player to go would take the free Victory
Point card, and the second player would take the card to become First Player,
thus ensuring they would get the free Victory Point next turn.
Turn order ended up simply moving around the table, devolving into a
Progressive turn structure. However, the presentation of turn order as a choice
made it seem as if the game had more flexibility than it actually did. Having
forcing moves for the first two players made for a much less interesting play
experience. A similar issue arises in Stone Age, where expanding fields and
gaining workers are invariably the first two actions chosen in each round.
Sometimes the action that determines turn order is tightly integrated into
play. High Society has players bidding on objects, and the winner of an auction
begins the bidding for the next auction. Trick taking games, where the winner
of a trick takes the lead is a similar example, which will be explored in more

Turn Order and Structure

43

detail in Chapter 13. In both of these examples, play proceeds clockwise from
the new start player.
A variant of this mechanism is seen in Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery
and other games. In these, players take an action to secure their place in the turn
order, but more than one player can do this. The first player to do so becomes
the first player in the next round, the second player becomes second, and so on.
Players who do not take this action are moved to the back of the turn order.
This has similar issues to both the classic version of this mechanism and
the Pass Order mechanism (TRN-06). Players must give up the opportunity
for an action to improve their place in the turn order, and players that are
currently early in the order have less incentive to spend an action there. Also,
players that are early in the turn order have a better opportunity to keep it
because they will have a first chance of using later round actions to maintain
their turn position.
However, it does mitigate some of the issues of the base version of this
mechanism, as it puts more control into the hands of the players, albeit in an
inequitable way.

Pass Order

Description
On their turn, players may either take an action or pass. The first player who
passes becomes the new first player for the next round. The second player who
passes becomes the second player for the next round, and so on. Reversing
pass order and turn order is also possible when going later in turn order is
more advantageous.

Discussion
Pass Order attempts to address the issues created by more static turn-order
mechanisms, or those which order all players based on the actions of a single
player. With Pass Order, players are presented with a choice: take additional
actions this turn, or be earlier in the turn order for the entire next round. Players
have to estimate whether continuing to take actions in the current round is
worth more than having an earlier choice on actions in the following round.
A good place for this mechanism is in a game that features some type of
drafting (CAR-06). In Caylus, players place workers on buildings (“Worker
Placement,” Chapter 9) to receive certain benefits. Each building can be
occupied by only one player each round, so players are drafting from a limited
pool of possible actions. Going earlier in turn order ensures players can select
the buildings they desire most. But taking additional actions later in the turn
order can yield additional benefits.
Games in which players are very likely to take an equal number of actions
in a round are a poor fit for this mechanism. For example, if players only
have three actions in a turn, most likely they will all be passing after the same

Turn Order and Structure

45

number of turns. If players take six or more actions in a round, the cost of
losing later actions in the round is much reduced.
An important consideration with Action/Passing is the fate of the last
player who has not passed. This is an issue that affects any game in which
players end their round by choosing to pass. For example, in The Networks,
players receive more money or victory points for passing early, rather than
turn order position. Nevertheless, because The Networks is a Rochester draft
(see “CAR-06, Drafting” in Chapter 13), there are relatively few limits on the
ability of the last player still active to sweep up whatever cards remain on the
board. This can be quite powerful! Other games, like Francis Drake, limit the
ability of the last player to gain too much advantage by requiring expending a
limited pool of workers to activate the remaining buildings. Caylus addresses
this issue in a different way, by making it increasingly expensive to place
workers as more players pass. Finally, in Sentient, players who pass first go
last, which actually provides them with the advantage of sweeping the board.
Designers using this structure should be careful to align the turn order
reward (first or last) with the game. The mechanism works best when turn
order preference is strong, when players act many times over the course of
a single round, and when there is some hard limit on the total number of
actions a player can take. Rewards other than turn order advantage can be
employed as an alternative or in addition.
Two final notes of caution. First, designers must provide some physical
affordances for tracking who has passed and in what order. Ideally, these are
combined so that when a player passes, they move some indicator to show
that they have passed, and when they will play in a future turn. Secondly,
designers should also pay attention to the amount of downtime experienced
by the first player to pass.

Real-Time

Description
There are no turns. Players play as quickly as possible, subject to certain
constraints, until the game or phase is completed.

Discussion
Real-Time Games bring a lot of excitement to the table, as players frantically
work to completely execute their actions. However, they also bring a lot of
challenges for the designer.
First, Real-Time Games need to be very simple. Anything that causes
confusion requires the players to stop the action, resolve the issue, and then
continue, or just carry on with a confused player who stops enjoying the
experience, or possibly violates the rules unwittingly. This can place very real
constraints on what can and can’t be done from a design standpoint.
The designer also needs to address timing issues, if players are conflicting
in actions they wish to perform. There are several ways to deal with this:
• Players play cards onto stacks. Sequence in the stack indicates order.
• The player who touches a token first is allowed to manipulate it.
• Players do not interact during the real-time portion, but only after it is
completed and things can be resolved at leisure.
The level of intensity and focus required from players in a Real-Time Game
means that the game’s length needs to be short. Twenty minutes is a reasonable
maximum duration for a completely uninterrupted Real-Time Game.

Turn Order and Structure

47

Another consideration is dealing with mistakes and cheating. Some games,
like Pit Crew and Space Alert have specific rules for dealing with mistakes that
give a penalty to the players or cancel the attempted action.
As players are absorbed in their own actions, cheating can also be an issue.
In cooperative games like Space Alert, cheating is a different consideration.
However, for competitive games, the designer may need to incorporate design
techniques such as making sure that everything is in the open, that text on
cards is large enough to be understood across the table rapidly, and that there
is as little manipulation of components as possible (e.g., once a card or die is
placed in a spot, it cannot be moved from that spot).
However, there have been several successful games that have not protected
against mistakes and cheating, and it does not appear to have impacted their
success. In Captain Sonar (more correctly classified as using a Punctuated
Real-Time mechanism, TRN-08), each team writes and erases on laminated
control panels behind a screen. It would be quite simple for a team to cheat
behind the screen or make undetected mistakes. In practice, however, the
social contract seems to hold and players are not concerned about this. This
may open up more complex design opportunities for Real-Time Games, as
long as the game is marketed toward an audience that accepts this stance
regarding potential cheating.
