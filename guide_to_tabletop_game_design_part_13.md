In a game (or story or movie, etc.) you have a world, characters, and actions that the characters are
doing. One of these can be “weird” (strange, unusual, unconventional) but if you have more than one,
you will alienate your audience and significantly reduce your chances for success.

There’s nothing wrong with being weird, but if you want to make something more than a
niche game, don’t violate the triangle of weirdness.

Stories in Games
In addition to theme, thematic board games usually have stories. Stories are different than
themes in that they always have a beginning, a middle, and an end—­also known as acts.
You can use these different acts of the story to change the player’s focus during the game.
Players might be able to perform different actions or have different priorities during each act,
which helps reinforce the game’s theme.
For example, the story of the board game Clue (1949) starts with a murder. Someone is
guilty, and to win, you must discover who it is. The middle of the game is when you gather
evidence to narrow down choices and discover the suspect. The end of the game is when you
finally guess who the murderer is. Will you guess correctly? Or will you be wrong and the
murderer gets away?

“Ludo” meaning play or game and “narrative” meaning story.
There is a deeper explanation of the Triangle of Weirdness (with examples) in my book Level Up! The Guide to Great
Video Game Design (Wiley & Sons, 2010).

Some board games have very involved stories called branching narratives. These are
games that are inspired by the Choose Your Own Adventure books of the 70s and 80s. In these
games, the story can change and diverge in different directions depending on the choices
that you make. Examples of story games with branching narratives include Tales of the
Arabian Nights (2009), Mice and Mystics (2012), SeaFall (2016), and designer Ryan Laukat’s
games including Above and Below (2015), Near and Far (2017), and Sleeping Gods (2021).
Board games with branching narratives often take a long time to play and are designed to be
played over multiple sessions. They come with a large story book that is read during the
game. Remember to organize these story books like you would a rule book—­being able to
quickly find a passage or paragraph is of primary importance.
There are pros and cons to designing these types of story games. If you love writing stories or
lore, then this is a great way to express yourself! The appeal of these story games is that it is
supposed to be different every time you play it. But that isn’t always the case. Be mindful of
how many times a player reads the same content during multiple play sessions. Try to structure your story so that the player is reading some new content often. These story games can
take a long time to write and even longer to playtest since you have so many different choices
and there are many ways that the game can go!
Just remember that a branching narrative can get fractal very fast, meaning you might end
up writing many divergent paths and you will end up losing control of the overall story. A
trick that I use when writing these types of stories is to bring the player’s choices back to a
bottleneck that looks something like what is shown in Figure 9.1.

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

Figure 9.1 Picture of fractal branching narrative

Following this structure will allow you to take control of the story again and make it go where
you need it to go. Remember, this is a board game, not a role-­playing game, and unless you
have a player acting as a gamemaster, the game needs to control the narrative!
Another type of storytelling in games is a campaign. This is where the story is loosely connected by encounters and events. Just like branching narrative games, campaigns are meant
to be played over many sessions. An advantage of a campaign game is that they provide natural break points for the players. Make sure you provide an easy way to recap the story, so if a
long period of time lapses between sessions, you won’t forget what’s going on!

Players Have Wishes
There’s another great thing that stories in games provide—­the opportunity to be someone
else for a short period of time. Board games give players a chance to be something they aren’t
in the real world, such as another person who lives a totally different life or even a different
gender or species!
A game should make a player feel something that they aren’t normally experiencing in the
real world, which is why I believe that a game should make a player feel either powerful,
rich, or smart—­preferably all three! Most game players aren’t these things in real life, but
thanks to board games, they can be, if only for a short while!
Gloomhaven (2017), Massive Darkness (2017), and Dwellings of Eldervale (2020) can make you
feel more powerful as you gain new skills, strength, or weapons to vanquish more difficult
enemies over the course of the game. I enjoy playing games like Chinatown (1999), Food
Chain Magnate (2015), and The Gallerist (2015) because they create tension between earning
more money (which you need to win) and having to spend it (to buy things that will help you
win). Plus, who doesn’t like ending the game with a big pile of money?

Knowledge games such as Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition (1981) and Cranium (1998) aren’t the
only way to make you feel smart. If you construct a productive resource generating engine or
execute a clever play that results in a chain of combos or pull off a tactic despite the odds
being against you, that makes the player feel smart. Who doesn’t like to feel smart?

Adding Drama and Conflict
Another trait of thematic games is conflict. Conflict is the struggle that happens when
opposing or incompatible needs, wishes, or internal or external demands clash. It can be a
mental struggle—­such as having to make a difficult decision or a physical struggle—­such as
two armies battling against each other. Conflict can take place during a competition where
you are trying to outperform another player, or it can be a battle of wits where you are trying to out-­think or out-­guess another player.

My friend and game designer Kathleen Mercury outlines9 three types of conflict.

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

Conflict occurs at two different scales—­large scale and small scale. Large-­scale conflict
often is the object or goal of winning the game. In Risk (1959), the large-­scale conflict is to
control the world. Small-­scale conflict happens when you are trying to gain control of a country. There are many small-­scale conflicts over the course of a game of Risk, but fewer large-­
scale ones. Because they are so important to the game (that’s how you win!), large-­scale
conflicts feel more important when they happen. That’s because conflict creates drama.
Drama is a powerful tool in a game designer’s toolkit. Drama keeps players engaged; it generates emotions—­fear, greed, jealousy, as well as hope, surprise, and excitement—­that motivates the players to act or make decisions. Drama creates tension, which is important to
maintaining the player’s interest during the game.
Designer Alan R. Moon describes the tension found in his game Ticket to Ride (2004) this
way: “The tension comes from being forced to balance greed—­adding more cards to your
hand, and fear—­losing a critical route to a competitor.” The following are a few dramatic situations that help create tension:
■■

■■

■■

A close race: When all the player’s final status or score are very close, players want
to be able to win the game even if they have fallen behind. You don’t want the gap
between the winner and the other players to be too large. If your player’s final scores
are 21, 12, and 3, then you might want to reexamine your design. If the final scores are
21, 20, and 19, then you are doing great! You can use handicapping, first-­player disadvantages, and catch-­up mechanisms to help narrow the gap.
A close call: This can be when the players narrowly escape a bad situation or loss.
Often this takes the place of a character ability, a rules exception, a power on a card, or
gaining a benefit like a re-­roll or extra action. If your game is about danger, you want
your player to feel like they are going to be in danger, but they don’t have to be in danger all the time. The feeling is much more important than the reality.
The illusion of a “no-­win” situation: Even better is when the players feel like they
are doomed but still manage to succeed through their own cleverness or even luck of
the draw or roll. Stacking the odds against the players is one way to create this feeling
of doom, but the designer should provide players with a way to “cheat.” Think of
Captain Kirk and the Kobayashi Maru,10 which was supposed to be an unwinnable situation, but he still found a way to beat it. Because he cheated. But we don’t feel bad
that he cheated, because we like the hero and want him to win, no matter what.

In the game Cosmic Encounter (1977), there are many ways the player can “cheat” to get
an advantage or win an encounter. One way to achieve this is to temporarily upset the balance of the game. Many game designers are obsessed with balance, but in a thematic game,

First seen in the movie Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982).

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

sometimes it’s good to throw that out the window for the sake of drama. As Peter Olotka,
one of Cosmic Encounter’s designers says, “Balance is for wienies!”
These are all great ways to create drama, but do you know what another great way is?
Randomness! Yes, our old pal “luck!” But randomness isn’t bad, especially in thematic
games. Some players enjoy the risk and thrill of getting a great roll or a disastrously bad one!
Remember, there are two types of randomness—­input randomness and output randomness. In previous chapters, we’ve already talked about how dice and cards can be used to
generate random results, but thematic games sometimes have unusual and interesting ran­
domizers to create interesting and exciting gameplay.
■■

In Incan Gold (2005), a deck of cards reveals a good or bad result. Players must choose
whether to remain “in” or “out” before the card is revealed.
In Cuphead: Fast Rolling Dice Game (2021), enemy cards are randomly drawn from a
deck to determine which results the player must roll. Players then quickly roll dice to
match those results within a time limit.
In Roll Player (2016), dice are randomly drawn from a bag, rolled for results, and
assigned to locations on your character board.
In Texas Chainsaw Massacre the Board Game (2023), tokens are collected by the players
and put into a draw bag. Players can see “good” and “bad” tokens going in. Then the
player draws from the bag, trying to get as many good tokens as possible before their
luck runs out.
Im Zeichen des Kreuzes (2001), uses a “combat tower” in which cubes are dropped.
Players drop all battling armies in the top: everything that comes out at the bottom
fights. Armies that do not fall through stay in the tower until dislodged by armies from
a following battle.
In Dark World: Village of Fear (1993), a plastic cross holds colored beads, which, when
shaken, fall into the narrow passage on the cross. The order of the colored beads determines player turn order.

What’s your favorite randomizer in a game? ________________________________
You’ll notice that some of these random systems use cards, while others use dice, tokens, or
even cubes to generate random results. Which one is best? It totally depends on how you
want your game to play. The following are things to consider for each:
■■

■■

Dice: The benefit of dice is you can roll many at once. Who doesn’t love throwing a big
handful of dice? You can use dice with different sides and customs faces. We learned
many ways to use dice in Chapter 4.
Cards: Cards can have pictures, multiple icons, values, text, and adding more cards is
cheaper and easier than other components. You can have decks that do different

CHAPTER 9

■■

■■

■■

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

things—­combat, treasure and weapons, AI for enemies, maps—­all the different uses
we discussed in Chapter 5.
Colored cubes (and meeples): These are great because they can change what they
represent during the game. A red cube could be a demon if a card indicating it is in play,
but later it could represent a dragon. The components can be tossed into and drawn
out of a bag, pulled from a cube tower, or shaken in a box to generate random results.
Tokens: Tokens are a flexible component. You can make a token have a “blank” side
and flip it to reveal a random result or encounter like a card. They can have images like
cards, they can be flipped like a coin (or a POG—­remember those?), they can be tossed
onto a target, and they can be drawn from a bag. They are relatively inexpensive
to create.
Mobile app: Mobile device apps often include randomizers. These can include sound
effects, music, and animation to create a more exciting play experience.

Strategy vs. Tactics
“Tacticians know what to do when there is something to do; strategists know what to do when there is
nothing to do.” —­Chess Grandmaster Savielly Tartkover

Because many thematic games are centered around conflict and warfare, players must utilize
tactics and strategy if they hope to win. But what is the difference between strategy and tactics and how can games be designed to enable players to utilize them? First some definitions:
■■

■■

Strategy is the overarching plan that you create and execute to lead you to that goal.
You will need a strategy to plan your actions and tactics to execute them.
Tactics are the actual actions, means, and decisions that you take to achieve goals and
objectives—­whether they are short‑term or long‑term.

Strategy and tactics are complementary concepts. You will need both to be successful at playing a game. For example, when playing the game Pandemic, a strategy would be to concentrate on curing diseases at research stations, rather than flying around the world stemming
the rise of disease cubes whenever they appear. Your tactics would be to leave cities with
single cubes alone as they don’t present an immediate threat and concentrate your efforts on
collecting city cards. When five matching cards are discarded, the disease will be cured, and it
will be faster to remove them from the board when they appear.
I was once playing a friend’s prototype when I realized that if I kept playing using the strategy I was using, I was going to lose. I was aiming for a big splashy objective that awarded lots
of points, but when I did the math, I realized I could gain more points by changing my current strategy. The new objective was riskier and not as obvious, but it paid off! I was able to
win the game even though I had begun at a big disadvantage.

301

302

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

This is a sign of good game design. A player should always have a chance to win by switching
tactics midgame. This means there should be multiple objectives to pursue. Remember, the
best thing that you can give a player is a choice, especially a meaningful one. Also remember,
more choices mean more complexity.

Unraveling Complexity
Thematic games can be complicated. As a result, another trait of thematic games is that many
of them have a complicated rule book. Thematic games often have many systems and mechanisms that the player needs to understand in order to play: movement, combat, and objective rules; explaining specific mechanisms, examples, and exceptions; scoring and victory
conditions. As a result, it can be common for modern gamers to “play the game wrong” on
their first playthrough due to missing or not understanding a rule. It’s even worse when all
those rules are front-­loaded to the player.
Complexity applies to any sort of characteristic or development in a game that adds cognitive load for the players. Cognitive load is the amount of information that working memory
can hold at one time. Educational psychologist John Sweller said that since working memory
has a limited capacity, instructional methods should avoid overloading it with additional
activities that don’t directly contribute to learning.11 This applies to many things, especially games.
The truth is, since the 1990s, games have become more complex. Twilight Imperium (1997)
takes about 8 hours to play a full game. There are dozens of rule books for games like
Dungeons and Dragons, which new players can find intimidating. Rulebooks can get large
when a designer is trying to tell a complex story as in Tales of the Arabian Nights (2009),
Trickerion: Legends of Illusion (2015), or The 7th Continent (2017). Other games strive to model
complex simulations like in Kanban: Driver’s Edition (2014), which simulates working in the
automobile industry. The more complex a game becomes, the more cognitive load it adds on
to the player while learning the game; or maybe even worse, a player might not want play
because it “looks or sounds too complex.”
Complexity is not inherently bad; it’s just important to understand and recognize the complexities in your game. Once you know what complexities exist in your design, you can take
steps to reduce them or group them for easier learning. The following are a number of complexity types that can be found in games:

Rules and Mechanics Complexity
Rules and mechanics complexity is based on the number of rules that you must keep in
mind. When a player must check a rule in the rule book, it interrupts the flow of gameplay or
even causes conflict between players. It gets even worse when a player must find and deal
with an exception that deviates from the core rule, which some rule books might not have
accounted for.
Player aids can help players minimize search time and highlight important rules. You can
break rules into “small bites” of states/phases or triggers. Don’t overload players by requiring
them to learn everything at once. This is like how “chunking” is used to break up ideas, numbers, scoring for memorization, and learning purposes.
Changing or adding new rules over the course of the game can help ease the cognitive load.
In Fluxx (1997), the game’s rules and win conditions are constantly changing to create a
chaotic, random, funny game. In Friedemann Friese’s Fast Forward series of games, new
cards are revealed over the course of the game that add new rules. This is what legacy games
do well—­techniques like stickers that add rules to the rule books pace out the rules when the
players need to know them.
Planning Complexity
Planning complexity arises when you consider all the optimal strategies for success. Chess
is the classic example of this: if I move this pawn and then they move that pawn and then I
move this knight, what will the board look like? Which of these paths are the right path? The
longer it takes to win the game, the less predictable the strategies are.
Nested Complexity
Nested complexity is complexity that is not obvious at first, but as more rules are combined or added to the game, the game’s complexity grows. Even a simple game like Onitama
(2014), where there are significantly fewer pieces and a smaller board, offers many choices
for the player to make.
If the player has too many options, they may become paralyzed with indecision. This is called
analysis paralysis in board gaming circles. Success depends on planning out your moves in
advance, being able to intuit what the game state will look like in the future after several
moves have been made.

303

304

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Some games will provide charts or diagrams to help the players visualize their options.
Scrabble (1948) displays the tiles, their points, and their regularity to help players make decisions. In Kingdom Death: Monster (2015), the bosses’ AI card removes the player’s confusion
by clearly showing in what area its attack or movement path will be. The characters in ALIEN
Fate of the Nostromo (2020) have special abilities to help players strategize at the start of the
game. This helps speed up the gameplay.
Spatial Complexity
Spatial complexity is concerned with the relationship of components to the player, each
other, and the play area. Remember the Six Zones of Play from Chapter 2? Following those
rules will help reduce this complexity.
Even the graphics on a board can add to spatial complexity of a game. The gameplay itself
might not be that complex, but first impressions count when it comes to visuals.
Alien Frontiers (2010) has a lot going on visually on its board, but everything is regulated to
its own section. The sectors of the central moon are clearly delineated. The sectors and their
correlating satellites are clearly marked with dotted lines. This helps players understand the
relationships and where the components need to be placed.
Tile placement as found in Bärenpark (2017) requires players to “Tetris” pieces together. Play­
ers must determine how these pieces fit together and must plan to use spatial relationships.
Some games are built around the concept of this complexity such as in the game Set (1988),
which uses shape, color, and patterning to confuse the mind and eye. How many sets can you
find? Other games, such as NMBR 9 (2017), are built around the “noise” created when components interact with each other. Khet the Laser Game (2005) uses spatial complexity as part
of its gameplay. Players must predict the laser’s path before firing it off to see if they
have scored.
Component Complexity
Component complexity is when there are lots of different components and economies.
Sometimes it just becomes more than the player can handle or keep track of. They forget
what things do or in what order they are meant to be used. As a general rule, you should
never have a component do “two things” during a game.
Some games include a lot of bits that aren’t used in a single game session, which means that
there are lots of options for future play (Betrayal’s tokens)—­pointing the players toward
what is needed right away and what is used later during play. Avoid adding new rules onto
components (like Magic the Gathering [1993] often does) that only that player can see. It’s
fairer to make sure every player knows the rules (or at least learns them at the same time).

Arithmetical Complexity
Arithmetical complexity pertains to the amount and complexity of arithmetic required
for a game. Scoring in Russian Railroads (2013) can get quite complex what with point-­
generating structures, bonuses, doublers, and multipliers that all contribute to a player’s
final score. Arithmetical complexity also pertains to the number of variables that one can
keep in memory at any time.
Sometimes the players have too many options, like too many actions that they can perform,
and they start to get “stuck” while determining all the options they have. Mathematical complexity isn’t always expressed as equations.
Logical Complexity
Logical complexity is the foundation of deduction and induction games. This requires
players to keep track of many factors to achieve victory. In Mystery of the Abby (1995), players
must track different combinations of hair, clothes, body weight, and facial hair to determine
which monk is the killer. The complexity is part of the gameplay as obfuscated facts are
uncovered by the players using logic.
The benefit of reducing complexity means there’s more time for play! If you want to hear an
in-­depth discussion on this topic, check out my Ludology podcast.12

Bring on the Bling
Another classic trait of thematic games is chrome. The term itself originated with war gamers in the 1970s. Chrome refers to extra rules, designed to simulate specific situations, that
often add nothing to the gameplay at the expense of lengthening the rulebook and the game.
The negative version of the term chrome is “fiddly,” as in “too much chrome can get fiddly.”
As games started to evolve from mostly cardboard to fancier physical bits as a result of the
use of miniatures in Dungeons and Dragons and Milton Bradley’s Gamemaster series, the
term chrome gained another meaning. In this case, chrome referenced a game being “plussed
up.” This is when components are included that don’t improve a game’s gameplay but rather
make the game look better. This is like how chrome on a hot rod doesn’t make the car go
faster; it just makes it looks cooler.
Now chrome refers to custom dice, metal coins, resin tokens, plastic scenery, cloth play mats,
or anything that will make you go “ooooh!” when you see the game. The most popular chrome
in board gaming must be miniatures. While there are plenty of miniature-­based games that

can be played without a board, that is not our focus here. Instead, let’s look at the three ways
a player can be represented on a game board.

A pawn is fine for a quick-­and-­dirty prototype, but they convey very little other than the
player’s color. You can buy them online or take them from another game that you already
own. They’re not very exciting to look at, but they do the trick.

A standee is a flat cardboard pawn on a stand that represents a character or item. The advantages of standees are that they are very cheap to make, and you can use artwork from your
game on them.
To make a standee, get a stiff piece of cardboard (I recommend using comic book backing
board) or Bristol board and print or draw your character on it. You can buy plastic stands for
standees, but if you want to save money, you can just create the stand for the standee by folding and taping or gluing the ends together like this:

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

Standees, especially die-­cut ones in games like Picture Perfect or Dead of Winter a Crossroads
Game, look great thanks to their interesting silhouettes and artwork, but they can be flimsy.
A stiff breeze or a bump into the game table can knock them over. And you can’t see what’s
on them from a side view. That’s why you should use a stand for your standees. These are little plastic clips with bases to give them just enough weight from falling over.

A miniature is a plastic or metal figure of a player’s character or an enemy or a thing in the
game. If you are strapped for cash, you can always take them from another game to use in
your prototype. I’ve bought games just for the miniatures. You can buy them from your
friendly neighborhood gaming store or online. Or you can make them yourself. But before
we talk about how to do that, consider the following reasons why you would want to use
miniatures in your game:
■■

Miniatures represent a player in the game’s world and are more interesting than a
generic pawn or flat standee.

Miniatures create a “miniature world” that many gamers find appealing. Table presence was mentioned earlier and how exciting that is for players. An exciting part of
board gaming is its toyetic nature. Some games look like little worlds that you immediately are drawn toward. They draw your eye, making you want to pick up the pieces
and join in on the fun!
Miniatures are just cool. It doesn’t matter if you are a pewter dog from Monopoly or a
giant Elder God in Cthulhu Wars (2015), a well-­sculpted miniature is a pleasure to look
at and fun to move around the board.
Many gamers enjoy painting miniatures. Painting miniatures is a pleasurable activity,
a way to artistically express oneself and provides extra value from the game. You can
get a great sense of pride seeing the reactions your painted figures get when showing
them to friends or sharing images online.

I’m a big fan of using miniatures in game designs. I’ve designed five games with miniatures,
which has helped me to learn why and how to best use them. Here are some tips and tricks
I’ve learned about making miniatures:

■■

■■

■■

■■

Know your scales: 28mm (1.10 inches) is the average size of a human-­sized miniature. Another common scale is 32mm if you want more heroic or detailed miniatures.
The figures can be smaller or larger depending on whatever creature or character they
are representing. Cthulhu Wars’ giant “bigatures” are still in 28mm scale, but the characters they represent are so large, they are several inches tall!
Smaller miniatures such as those found in Risk or Axis and Allies are 1/72
scale: This scale is better if you need to have multiple miniatures in a single area. They
can be tiny to hold and move around, but if you don’t want your miniatures to take up
a ton of space, then go smaller.
Give your miniatures a distinctive silhouette: This helps players quickly identify
which miniature is which from far away and speeds up the time it takes for a player to
find a mini during the play. Colored miniatures (either monochromatic or prepainted)
help with this as well.
Don’t make your character designs too top heavy: No matter how cool they
look, miniatures still need to be able to stand up and not fall over. A good sturdy base
can help with this.

Design your miniatures to be easy to pick up: If a mini is spindly or thin, then
make sure players can move it using the base. I once played a game with a monster
miniature that was covered with spines, and it hurt to pick it up! Ow! Don’t do that!
Account for the space for multiple minis to fit on your play area: When
designing Rayguns and Rocketships, I had to make sure that the rocket miniatures could
be positioned next to each other and rotated without bumping into each other.
Consider the material to be used for your miniatures: Miniatures are made
from a variety of materials—­from plastic and resin to pewter and polylactic acid (PLA).
When designing your characters, be aware that some materials are more fragile than
others, so a sword that will be fine when made in plastic or pewter might be too thin
and snap when printed in PLA+ or resin. There are tools such as Shapeway’s Netfabb
tool that can be used to “test” the thickness of your model before you produce it.
Use miniatures for more than just characters: Consider adding miniatures as
scenery, props, or other elements in your game. A huge part of the HeroScape series’
appeal is its 3D terrain. And of course, the best thing about HeroQuest is the tiny
furniture!13

Making Miniatures
Making original miniatures used to be prohibitively expensive. Hiring an artist (if you aren’t
one yourself) to sculpt a figure out of wax or “green stuff”14 can cost hundreds of dollars.
Once you have the miniature, you then need to use it to “cut steel” and make an injection
mold. An injection mold is a steel box that has a reverse impression of your miniature inside.
When making an injection mold, it’s always better to try to fit as many characters as possible
into a model, so that you are making only one mold. Then, once you have made the model,
usually one color of molten plastic is injected into the mold. They harden and voila! A plastic
miniature! Some factories can make multicolored figures, but this increases the cost. Cutting
steel for miniatures costs thousands of dollars—­that is, if you have access to a factory that
makes them, which are usually overseas in Asia.
The good news is, thanks to 3D sculpting tools like Blender and Mudbox and Zbrush, it’s now
a lot easier and cheaper to create miniatures these days. You can sculpt your own digitally to
create .stl files, which is the digital format used by most 3D printers. There are several artists from whom you can buy or download files for free. You can design your own 3D character
at a site like HeroForge (heroforge.com).

Green stuff is the nickname of Kneadatite, a two-­part compound putty that can be mixed to the consistency of
chewing gum and then sculpted as it gets less sticky and more pliable. Kneadatite is readily available in ribbons or
semi-­liquid form and is somewhat easy to work with, provided you do so in small amounts at a time. You must work
relatively fast—less than an hour—otherwise it will dry and harden. It hardens to the consistency of plastic and
then can be cut, sanded, primed, and painted (although you want to skip those last two steps if you are making
molds from them.)

I’ve used 3D printing services like Shapeways15 and FormLab16 to print my miniatures. Some
local libraries now offer 3D printing series too! These printers offer a wide variety of materials, including metals, but it takes time to get your printed mini back in the mail. These services can be pricey, especially if you are on a budget. Fortunately, a 3D printer is a more
cost-­effective way if you plan on printing out several miniatures for your prototype.
At the time of this writing, there are two types of printers. Fused deposition modeling
uses PLA—­a colored plastic filament—­that is melted to create the figure, and liquid resin
printer exposes a layer of photosensitive liquid resin to a UV-­laser beam; the resin then
hardens in the desired pattern, and the object is built layer by layer until it is complete.

PLA comes in spools of filament that are easy to store. They come in a wide variety of colors.
3D-­printed miniatures can leave a visible print line or layer artifacts, which, depending on
the printer, has the texture of sandpaper and reduces the overall aesthetic of the model and
makes painting difficult.
Resin—­or vat photopolymerization—­printers can create figures with more detail, but if the
model is too thin, it can snap if not handled or stored carefully. Its smoother surface is much
better for painting. Because the resin is photosensitive, it needs to be stored in an opaque
container and will start to lose its photo reactivity properties over time. You have to be careful when using a resin printer because they can produce toxic fumes. Make sure you operate
a resin printer in a well-­ventilated area.

Collectability
Another trait found in thematic games is collectability. This trend first took off in tabletop gaming with collectible card games (CCGs) like Magic the Gathering. Cards were ranked by rarity—­
common, uncommon, rare, and super-­rare. Super-­rare cards were usually the most powerful cards
in the game, which drove players to buy multiple packs as they “chased” these hard-­to-­find cards.

Seeing the success of collectability in the card market, publisher Wiz-­Kids followed suit with
its miniatures game Mage Knight (2000). Players could buy a base set of 10 random prepainted, plastic miniatures, while “Booster Packs” contain 5 miniatures. Other miniature
games that utilize collectability included Heroclix (2002), Pirates of the Spanish Main (2004),
Dreamblade (2006), and many others.
Kickstarter stretch goals have now become the place to offer collectible and rare components
for games, but rather than go into that here, we will discuss Kickstarters in Chapter 10.

The Gimmick
You gotta have a gimmick.
That last thematic game trait we’ll talk about are gimmicks—­a device or trick designed to
attract your customer’s attention. As they say, you don’t necessarily need a gimmick to make
a board game, but it doesn’t hurt! Board games have used a wide variety of gimmicks over the
years. The gimmicks can include the following:

■■

■■

Paper craft: Paper craft is a featured three-­dimensional cardboard element used in
gameplay. These can be relatively easy to make, provided they are sturdy enough to
sustain wear. It helps if they are easy to assemble/disassemble for storage. Examples
include the train in Colt Express (2014), the Starship Enterprise in Star Trek Panic
(2016), the tree in Everdell (2018), the maze in Princess Jing (2018), and the charming
little buildings in Dark World: Village of Fear (1993).
Pop-­ups: There is a long-­time connection between book printing and board games.
Essentially, anything you can print in a book you can make in a board game. Engineering
a pop-­up book can be rather tricky, especially since they are meant to fold back down
during storage. There are plenty of books and websites that can show you how to make
a pop-­up. Pop-­up game boards used to be much more common in early board games

CHAPTER 9

although it has been “rediscovered” in modern times with games such as Disney
Princess Pop-­Up Magic Castle (2014), Wonder Book (2021), and The Shivers (2022).

■■

“Startle” mechanisms: There is another type of “pop-­up” that startles you if you
make a mistake or lose the game. These are primarily found in kid’s games like Perfection
(1973), Pop-­up Pirate! (1975), Jaws (1975), Crocodile Dentist (1991), and Don’t Wake
Daddy (1992). These toy-­like contraptions often are in the shape of a creature or person that springs to life when activated. These games are made from molded plastic so
that they don’t break during repeat play sessions and are mostly manufactured by
mass-­market toy companies like Mattel, Hasbro, and Goliath Games due to the complication of their design and manufacturing.

Contraptions: A slightly simpler contraption is found in kids’ games like Mouse Trap
(1963), Which Witch? (1970), or Fireball Island (1986) that use a Rube Goldbergian17
device to activate gameplay. Similar in construction are the plastic or cardboard cube
towers found in Shogun (2006), Amerigo (2013), and Edge of Darkness (2019).
Glow-­in-­the-­dark components: These components are found in my beloved Green
Ghost (1965) or games like Barnabas Collins Dark Shadows Game (1969) and Ghost Party
(1989). Other games use UV reactive plastics like Nexus Ops (2005) to make their
sci-­fi pieces glow under a black light.
Textures: Some games utilize unusual textures. Nyctophobia (2018) has blindfolded
players trying to escape a killer using only their sense of touch. Dr Shark (2011) has
players identifying pieces only by touch. Cranium (1998) and Barbarossa (2008) has
players using sculpting clay to create clues for other players.
“Red lens”: “Red lens” is a piece of red clear cellophane that players can look through
to see “hidden” images. It requires you to print an image. These are often found in kid’s
games like Jumanji (1995) and Rat-­A-­Tat Cat 10th Anniversary (2006) and mystery-­
themed games like The Mysteries of Old Peking (1987), Clue Mysteries (2005), and
Decrypto (2018).
Technology: If you really want to get complicated with your gimmicks, you can
always add technology to your game! If a technology exists, then game designers have
come up with clever ways to use it in their games.

Sound: Some games utilize sound. Voice of the Mummy (1973) has a miniature
record player that gives commands and curses to the players. Other games like
Escape the Temple, Last Night on Earth, and Touch of Evil come with thematic
soundtracks that sometimes act as timers.
Computers: Mall Madness (1988) and The Omega Virus (1992) has a primitive
computer that generates random results for the players and produces an electronic
voice and sound effects to enhance gameplay.
Lasers: In Khet: The Laser Game (2005), players use lasers and mirrors to bounce
the beam from one end of the board to another!
Magnets: Bermuda Triangle (1975) features a storm cloud with magnets underneath. As it passes over the players’ ships (also with magnets), they might get
sucked up in the storm!
LED light: Vampire Hunter (2002) has a tower that shines either blue or red LED
light onto the board. Depending on the color of the light, certain images appear or
vanish, which changes the player’s path and activates traps. Waldschattenspiel
(1985) is a unique game that requires a lit candle or LED light to play. In it, the

Rube Goldberg (1883–1970) was an American cartoonist best known for his drawings of overly complicated contraptions to do simple tasks. Mousetrap is a perfect example of what is now known as “Rube Goldberg machine”.

shadows of trees are thrown across the board in which players use to hide their little
gnome characters from a seeker player.

VCRs: In the early 90s, VCR (or VHS) board games were all the rage. These are
games that used taped video content (played on a video cassette player) in conjunction with a board as a combination timer, randomizer, and tormentor to the players. Nightmare (aka Atmosfear) (1985) featured an evil gatekeeper that berated you
while you searched a graveyard for hidden keys. For a few years, this format was
very popular, and companies rushed to put out a game featuring their IP. You could
be threatened by Darth Vader in Star Wars: The Interactive Video Board Game (1996),
party hard with Wayne’s World VCR Board Game (1992), or experience Bij in Star
Trek: The Next Generation – The Interactive VCR Board Game – A Klingon Challenge
(1993)! Sports and quiz games were also popular in this genre. If you still own a
working VHS player, I recommend trying one of these. They can be a lot of silly fun!
Apps: Now that everyone has a mobile device, game designers can use applications (apps) to increase their game’s experience. Whether it’s a web-­enabled app
that plays different musical timers like in Meeple Circus (2017), an app that acts as
the AI for alien invaders as in XCOM the Board Game (2015), and app where you can
use smartphone technology to pilot a virtual ship such as in World of Yo-­Ho (2016),
or an app that creates a virtual reality that you must search for clues as in Chronicles
of Crime (2018). One Night Ultimate Werewolf (2014) has a great app that doubles as
a narrator for the game. However, I prefer it when the use of an app to play a game

315

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

is optional, especially if the app is providing sound that is crucial to playing the
game—that way if I’m low on power or I’m in a noisy convention hall, I don’t need
to listen to the app to play.
As a video game developer, please be aware that making these apps is very
complicated and expensive—­you are essentially making a second game to go with
your board game. If you want to learn more about making mobile games, check out
my book Swipe This! The Guide to Great Touchscreen Game Design.

Thematic Mechanisms

tools to our game designer toolbox. There are a number of mechanisms you can add to your

Variable Player Powers and Characters
With variable player powers, each player character in the game has a unique power that (usually) matches the personality or archetype of the character. For example, you would expect a
pirate to steal something (another card, a coin, a resource), a warrior to get a bonus in combat or start the game with a weapon, and a doctor to be able to heal another player.
Variable player powers were first inspired by the character classes from role-­playing games
and were incorporated into fantasy-­themed board games like Dungeon! (1975), War of the
Ring (1977), and Magic Realm (1979) but found their way into sci-­fi games like Cosmic
Encounter (1977), OGRE (1977), and Dune (1979).

CHAPTER 9

When I was designing ALIEN: Fate of the Nostromo (2020), I gave Ripley the ability to move
other characters around on her turn, as she was the character who kept a level head and told
the other characters what to do during the movie. Lambert, on the other hand, was a very
cautious character, so I gave her the ability to look at the top card of the encounter deck and
then could choose to put it at the bottom of the deck.
When designing these types of powers, make sure to differ each power so they aren’t too
similar—­such as the frost giant that does +1 frost damage and a fire giant that does +1 fire
damage. Make every character’s power useful but distinct. Much like the characters in a
fighting video game—­like Street Fighter—­having each character play differently will entice
the player to try the other characters to see what “they feel like.”

There is another type of character found in thematic games, and that’s the enemy! This can
be any sort of adversary that prevents the player from obtaining their goal. In thematic
games, because there is often an emphasis on conflict, enemies must be defeated. Designing
enemies can be great fun—­this is often where you can get really creative. But while it is fun
to design zombies and bandits, space aliens, and pirates, you should also design the enemy’s
function first. Here are a few tips to use when designing enemies:
■■

■■

Just like with a player’s powers, enemies should be as distinct as possible. Instead of
designing a living skeleton and a living skeleton with a sword, I recommend a living
skeleton with a sword and a living skeleton with a bow. Or even better, a skeleton with
a sword and a ghoul with a bow! The bow-­wielding enemy is going to pose a different
type of threat to the player that it can hit you from a distance. Part of the fun of combat for players is when you must assess a threat and then devise a strategy to defeat it.
Enemies should have a chance to defeat the player. If an enemy is too easy, then the player
is going to get bored with combat. Combat should be exciting! I’ve seen a few games
that allow the enemy to level up just like the player can. In Massive Darkness (2017),

players draw cards to represent the monster encountered. The number of monsters
encountered increases based on the number of players. However, as the players
descend into the dungeon, the monsters get stronger too.
There are other ways to hurt players. Enemies’ attacks can temporarily remove player’s
abilities, they can knock a player back or reduce their speed, and they can steal
resources like money or cards from the player. Or they could be confused and think
that their fellow players are the bad guys!
Give enemies other things to do than just hurt the player. Giving the enemy an agenda or
objective makes them feel more like real creatures. For example, a weaker enemy might
make a beeline for a gate to let bigger, stronger enemies into the battle. Or maybe they
might try to steal a weapon away from you so that they can use it in the fight!
Finally, give the players other alternatives to fighting. Perhaps you can bribe an enemy not
to fight with money or give them a gift in the form of a card or item to let you pass
peacefully. Scare them off using some trick or spell. You could even convince them to
join your side! By giving the player a different option to resolve conflict makes the
game feel more like a story!

Asymmetric powers are the same concept as variable player powers, but with a greater difference between the roles. In Vast: The Crystal Caverns (2016), the knight, goblin, dragon, and
cave roles all have vastly different powers, abilities, and even rule sets from one another. On
the one hand, this creates great repeat playability as the player has a new play experience
with each new character. On the other hand, the player must also be familiar with all the
rules that the other characters can do to plan their strategy against them, which can be quite
overwhelming for new players.

Leveling
Another concept that comes from RPGs is leveling up. This is where your character’s statistics, powers, and abilities improve over the course of the game. Often, you will earn experience points or complete objectives to level up their character. Each time the player gains a
level, they often improve their stats, such as gain more movement or deal more damage, or
they might gain new powers and abilities. They might gain access to better equipment
or unlock more challenging enemies or objectives. Some games have a cap to leveling up or
might reset the player’s starting level with each new play session or adventure.
Designer Rob Daviau thought about how games would reset after each play session, but the
players would remember those previous games, and it would impact how they played
the game. He wondered if there was a way that a game could “remember” what happened
in the previous game and have it be reflected in the way it could be played.

There were already games that maintain the player’s level over multiple game sessions—­
