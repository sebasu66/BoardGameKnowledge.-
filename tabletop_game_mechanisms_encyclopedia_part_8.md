absurdist Win, Lose or Banana, where the player who draws the “Win” card
tries to guess which player holds the Banana card, but is the only player who
doesn’t know the disposition of all the cards. What’s notable about these
games is that the social dynamic of being the only person not in the know
creates enormous pressure, tension, and the possibility for humor—often at
one player’s expense.

This technique does not have to be used only in competitive games.
Cooperative games may put communication restrictions on one or
more players, and challenge them to convey information to other players
(STR-02). Mysterium places one player in the role of a ghost, who needs to
get the other players to correctly identify the elements of a mystery (location,
person, and weapon), but can only communicate by playing one or more
elaborately illustrated cards to the players as a “dream.”
Though hidden information not generated by player actions is everywhere,
little of it exists in classic European style games. Though we often draw the
line between these styles based on whether they employ input randomness or
output randomness, the element of having only public information also aligns
closely with the European design school.

Communication Limits

Description
Games may limit players from communicating with one another openly. These
restrictions can be absolute as they relate to certain specific pieces of information,
or they may restrict certain types of communication, such as speaking.

Discussion
Communication limits are most common in cooperative games, but they exist
in other kinds of games as well. Many games limit players from revealing
privately held cards. In Cosmic Encounter, players may openly discuss which
cards they intend to play, but the actual cards cannot be shown, in order to
preserve the possibility of a double-cross. In traitor games, identity cards are
an obvious example of communication limits.
In cooperative games or games with intra-team cooperation, communication
limits operate to make the game more difficult. Party games like Charades,
Pictionary, and Show & Tile, all ask players to communicate non-verbally,
with pantomime, drawing, or building with tangrams, respectively. These
games are all games of inductive reasoning, where the clues provided suggest
an answer. Hanabi is particularly notable in that the more players come to the
game with agreed-upon principles and conventions for how to play, the more
the game shifts from being about inductive reasoning to deductive reasoning.
Games with deduction mechanisms, in which players gain information by
asking specific types of questions—like Clue or hidden movement games like
Specter Ops—are another example of communication limits as a mechanism
to manage uncertainty, preserving enough of it for interesting play.
Returning to Hanabi, players are restricted not only in the type of
information they are allowed to provide, or the modality by which it may be

Uncertainty

229

provided, but also by frequency with which they may communicate. Players
have a limited number of clues, and if no clues are available players may
not communicate at all. Mysterium takes a similar approach, except that
communication is only limited between certain player roles. The ghost and the
mediums may only swap information through cards, but the mediums may
freely converse with one another. In Witness, players may only communicate
their information once, which leaves players unable to confirm what they’ve
heard or clarify anything they might have missed.
In the absence of specific rules of what information can be shared, play
groups are left to manage themselves. In The Game, the rules indicate that
players may not share the specific values of cards in their hands, but may say
“don’t play on that pile” or “don’t make a large jump on this pile.” In practice,
this can often lead to results very similar to players playing with open hands,
especially when players at the table have different ideas about what should and
should not be allowed. This dynamic is on full display in The Mind, where
the rules bar all communication, yet the gameplay is all about reading the
slightest and most subconscious of cues. Once again, each group will have
very different mores and norms by which they play.

Unknown Information

Description
Aspects of the game state are unknown to all players, but lie within a known
range.

Discussion
There are three categories of hidden-yet-knowable information: information
known to no players, information known to one or more players, and
information known to all but one player.
Unknown Information creates uncertainty during any given play of a
game, and creates variety in repeated plays. Event decks are a good example
of this kind of uncertainty. Players know the range of possible results, and
often the cadence by which information will be revealed, but they don’t
know the specifics, and the specifics can substantially impact strategy. In an
initial play, players may not even know the true range of possibilities, and
indeed, some game instructions encourage players to look through the deck
to familiarize themselves with the possibilities, or provide a card manifest or
similar catalog of possibilities. Pandemic’s infection deck generates enormous
tension precisely because the uppermost cards, formerly the discard pile, are
known to the players.
How unknown information will impact players on reveal can vary
mechanically too. When modeling exploration, like the face-down sector tiles
of Eclipse, explored tiles are revealed to all players. In Karuba, a new path tile
is revealed each turn but each player may use the tile differently, either adding
it to their personal board or discarding it for movement. Cards that enter a
market, like the ability cards in King of Tokyo, can be seen by all players, but
an acquisition mechanism limits and determines who can take advantage of

Uncertainty

231

them. In tile-laying games like Carcassonne, where players don’t have a hand,
the new tile drawn is known to all players, but only one player has agency
over its placement.

Hidden Information

Description
Aspects of the game state are hidden from all but one or a few players.

Discussion
Information can be known to one or more players, but not to all players. This
includes information we’ve covered elsewhere, like Hidden Roles (UNC-04),
or private hands of cards. However, in this context, we refer less to those sets
of information which are permanent elements of a player’s role in a game,
like their hand of cards. Instead, we’re considering things like the strength
of the monsters that all players can battle for victory points in Champions
of Midgard. The types of information that may be hidden in this manner
typically fall into a few categories: secret player abilities, secret goals, strength
of enemies, and the location of specific items or resources. Players might
spend actions or resources to gain this knowledge, or not. Another type of
information of this sort is specific knowledge of another player’s hand based
on deduction. If you hold the Princess in Love Letter, you can be certain
that nobody else does, but no other player can be certain about whether the
Princess is in your hand, any other player’s hand, or the draw deck.
Designers employ a variety of mechanisms and components to manage
hiding and revealing this kind of information. Cards are especially common,
as in Clue, where players respond to an accusation by showing a disproving
card only to the accusing player. Other options include face-down cards,
player screens, tokens with common backs but different fronts, and figures
with information on the bottom of their bases. More exotically, in Pikoko, a
competitive trick-taking game, players hold their hands facing out, so each

Uncertainty

233

player can see every card in hand, except those held in their own hand. Careers
begins with players selecting their own victory conditions as a mixture of
Fame, Happiness, and Money, and recording it on their personal play sheet.
These techniques can help add new layers of strategy for advanced players.
Once players understand what the range of the hidden information is, they can
try to deduce what it is from players who know it. This also offers opportunity
for bluffing. For example, paying attention to what elements players include in
a guess in Clue may give astute players knowledge of what cards other players
have been shown. But knowing that players may be looking out for that may
cause advanced players to continue to include elements in their guesses that
they think will lead their opponents to draw erroneous conclusions.

Probability Management

Description
Mechanism which allows players to influence the probabilities of certain
outcomes, but not directly determine them.

Discussion
Probability Management is intrinsic to all dice and card games. At its most
direct, players can gain dice modifier tokens that allow them to add or
subtract from the value of a die, as in Kingsburg or Sagrada. More obliquely,
in Backgammon players can move their blots (the name given to the checkers)
into positions that minimize the probabilities of good rolls for their opponents
and maximize those probabilities themselves.
Betting games allow players to assign stakes to probabilistic events like dice
rolls or card deals. However, the type of Probability Management we’ll cover
here is exemplified by deck-building games. In a deck-building game, such as
the progenitor of the genre, Dominion, players draw a hand of cards from a
private deck each turn, and play those cards to acquire other, more powerful
cards, usually from a central market. Players try to acquire more powerful
cards, and cards that synergize together. By keeping the deck tuned so that
draws consistently surface those cards, players seek to increase the average
output of their deck, in whatever terms—currency at the start of a game, and
victory point later is a typical framework. We’ll discuss Deck-Building in
depth in its own section (CAR-05).
Some games offer probability manipulation at rarified skill levels. In
Twilight Struggle, some cards leave the game after being played for their
events. High-level players are careful not to trigger cards showing their

Uncertainty

235

own events, and to trigger, in as safe a manner as possible, their opponent’s
events. Over time, the weight of the deck shifts and forces the opponent into
many difficult hand-management situations where they must trigger highly
damaging events. In Alhambra, players can draw currency into their hands,
either by taking a single card, or any number of cards adding up to no more
than 5. Players gain a bonus action when purchasing tiles with exact change,
and a great deal of the skill in this game lies in managing a hand that can
match many values. Failure to realize this aspect of gameplay results in a
substantial loss of player agency.

Variable Setup

Description
The starting game state varies from game to game, through changes to shared
game components like the map, and/or or changes to starting player setups,
resources, objectives, etc.

Discussion
Variable Setup is sometimes equated with replayability, and can certainly
contribute to it, though they are not the same thing. The line between setup
and gameplay isn’t always that clear either. But setup can have an outsize
effect on uncertainty and overall game outcomes. Catan’s rules recommend
new players play with a specific board layout, and provide rules for board
construction that ensure that no one spot is over-powered relative to others.
Players often ignore this rule, and this imbalanced setup can easily advantage
one player over the other. Similarly, the randomly dealt alien powers in Cosmic
Encounter define the game almost entirely, and shape its dynamics even more
dramatically than Catan’s setup. Dominion’s selection of ten kingdom cards is
similarly impactful—those cards can be considered the last page of the rules.
In many cases, variable setups don’t impact uncertainty once setup is
complete, because nothing that happens in the game is probabilistically
dependent on setup. After faction board tops and bottoms are selected in
Scythe, for example, there is no further uncertainty. This is as distinguished
from Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, where more interactions are
available with the loyalty deck, and the makeup of that deck can change
prior to the next loyalty phase.
Some variable setups incorporate hidden or unknown information. In
Specter Ops, the runner who is trying to evade the hunters gets to secretly select
a few equipment cards out of the available pool. In theory, hunters can know

Uncertainty

237

the complete set of equipment cards and how they work, though whether
that’s true in practice—whether players do in fact look in the rulebook to read
about all the equipment—is questionable. Designers should provide player
aids summarizing this type of information if it’s important that players know
all the possibilities.
Designers need to be careful that randomized setups don’t create balance
issues. This is particularly true in longer games. Often, having limitations on
the randomization (like redoing a setup if a certain number of the same type
of tile are placed in a row), or giving players a pregame chance to respond
to the random setup is required. An example of the latter is found in Catan,
where there is a snake draft for placement of player’s initial settlements. This
allows players to moderate the vagaries of the initial chance board setup.

Hidden Control

Description
Players have hidden influence on locations or characters, which they reveal
to perform actions.

Discussion
In a game of this kind, play is divided up between assigning influence
and either declaring or spending that influence to trigger the effects of the
character or location in question. In Mythology, players secretly assign control
points to heroes (or monsters, events, etc.) in one phase. In a later phase in
the round, any player may attempt to activate these heroes by announcing
that they are taking control. If nobody challenges that control, the action
succeeds. If another player challenges, the players engage in an auction-like
process of declaring an amount of control points that they had previously
assigned. Players may choose to reveal none, some, or all of the control points
they have assigned in an effort to take control of the hero, and the player who
reveals the most influence is awarded control.
In Kremlin, players influence politicians in the Soviet party, each of whom
can trigger certain actions based on their altitude in the party hierarchy.

Uncertainty

239

Players write down influence they assign to politicians on a secret log sheet and
then reveal some or all of the claimed influence to control these politicians.
Revealed politicians are targets for exile, or, in some versions of the game,
execution by the KGB, so players must balance the risks and rewards of
revealing control.
This mechanism can also be used as part of a traditional public influence
system. In Colossal Arena, players bet on battling creatures. The player who
has placed the highest value of bets on a creature may use its special ability.
However, at the start of the game, each player may place a secret bet on a
single creature. Timing when to reveal your secret bet to seize control of a
creature is a key tactic in the game.
This kind of revealed influence is an uncommon mechanism, perhaps
because it requires a log sheet or some other form of tracking, which can be
cumbersome. It is also fragile to player deception that is hard to discover. But,
used judiciously or with proper physical techniques, it can be compelling.
This is perhaps an area that will be explored more in digital hybrid games.

Economics

ӶӶ
In one sense, games are about gaining and using assets to achieve victory.
Maximizing efficiency, utilization, and value are all important as players strive
to win.
Many things can be considered “assets” in a game. They can be obvious,
like money in Monopoly, and goods like bricks or grain in Catan. Or they can
be capital assets, like properties or buildings that generate other resources, or
intangible, like turn order, board position, network efficiency, or hand size.
In this text we will use the generic term “asset” to represent any of these.
The term “resource” will refer to money and goods, and not structures or
intangibles.
Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. It is not
surprising that many aspects of business and economics are adapted into
board-game mechanisms. In this chapter we examine a variety of mechanisms
that derive from manipulating resources and other sources of value.

Exchanging

Description
Players Exchange a set of assets for a different set with the bank.

Discussion
While traditionally this mechanism is thought of as Exchanging similar types
of resources, for example Exchanging two sheep for a wood at a sheep port in
Catan, under the expansive definition of assets, it also covers purchasing as a
mechanism. For example, in Monopoly players exchange the asset money for
the asset property. Similar considerations apply, so they are both covered here.
Often there are fixed formulas for exchanges. Again using Catan as an
example, a Road costs a Brick and a Grain, and a Town costs a Brick, Grain,
Wool, and Wood. These types of requirements can be used to give relative

Economics

243

value to different paths, or add an arc, as different resources may be required
in different ways under different strategies or at varying points of the game.
What was valuable early may become less so later on.
Some systems feature hierarchical organization of resources. For example,
in Roads and Boats, Wood is used to make Boards, Boards make Fuel, Fuel
and Gold make Coins, and Coins and Paper make Stock Certificates. As is
typical in this style of game, each of these transformations is a one-way trip.
Another example of hierarchical resources is Century: Spice Road. In this
game, yellow turmeric cubes are the least valuable, followed by red saffron cubes,
green cardamom cubes, and then the most valuable brown cinnamon cubes. In
this case, exchanges are possible (and common) between all levels. Certain cards
allow conversion of a brown cube back into several yellow and red cubes.
Hierarchical systems give players a clear sense of value. However, if this
value is too clear, other mechanisms need to be introduced to obstruct players
from getting use out of that value. Otherwise, the resources are basically
fungible like coins of different denominations. For example, in Century: Spice
Road players may exchange cubes for the Victory Card resource. The point
value of those cards is strictly equal to the value of the cubes, from one point
for yellow cubes, up to four points for brown cubes. Although not explicitly
stated, this 1–4 valuation of colors helps players quickly determine the relative
value of the converter cards. One that turns a green (value 3) into a brown and
yellow (value 4 + 1 = 5) gives a net gain of +2. A card that turns a red into
a green has a value of +1. While the value of the cards is known, the players
need to collect cards that enable them to perform exchanges as efficiently as
possible to get the specific set of cubes required by the victory card. Thus time
becomes another resource that players must consider when determining the
value of exchanges.
Non-hierarchical systems allow players to transform resources in different
directions, laterally. The sheep-port in Catan that was mentioned earlier is
an example. At that port, any other commodity may be obtained by turning
in two sheep. Permitting lateral exchange of resources gives a system more
flexibility and allows players to specialize, as focusing on just a few resources
will not limit them from getting others they may require.

Trading

Description
Players may Trade assets with each other.

Discussion
This is a form of Exchanging (ECO-01), except that players determine the
terms of the exchange. In order for Trading to work, the resources being traded
need to have different value to different players. This is often accomplished
through the use of Sets. See Chapter 12 for full details on the supporting
mechanisms. The value also needs to be difficult to precisely determine.
Again, sets are often used to accomplish this, as players may not know exactly
which cards their opponent has. Future value can also be obfuscated, usually
based on random future events.
Games typically limit what can be traded. For example, Civilization
gives players Commodity cards, and only those may be traded. In Sidereal
Confluence, on the other hand, where a variety of types of resources may be
combined in different deals. Sometimes games will strictly require like-forlike trades (e.g., two cards for two cards).
The actual mechanism of Trading can be conducted in several ways. Most
common is a defined open Trading session, where players shout out deals and
proposals, as in Civilization, Trade on the Tigris, Sidereal Confluence, and many
other games. Open Trading is fun and chaotic but has several downsides. First,
trade phases tend to be time-consuming, as players haggle. It can also leave

246

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

out players who don’t have many things to trade or are otherwise uninvolved.
Also, players who are less assertive may suffer a handicap. For these reasons,
Trade Phases often are timed, and players may only make deals within those
windows. If players can make a trade at any point during the game, it may
lengthen the game noticeably, and also lead to odd timing effects—what if
the players can trade between a combat resolution, and removal of casualties?
Questions that are not covered by the rules are likely to arise and outright
exploits may lurk beneath the surface.
However, there are games that allow Trading at any time. Monopoly is a
good example.
Another consideration in trades is the truthfulness factor. Most games
require some level of truth on the part of the players. In Civilization, players
must tell the truth about two cards out of the minimum of three they are
required to include in a trade. They may say whatever they would like about
the others. In Trade on the Tigris, each trade card has a top and bottom half
with different resources. Players must tell the truth about the top but may say
anything about the bottom. Introducing deception elements into the trade
mechanism can add some spice and excitement, but some players will feel
uncomfortable about it, and others will simply not have a poker face.
Regardless, however, when Trading resources, the deal typically must be
performed as defined. Because of this, most games ban future promises as
part of a trade, as it is difficult to police, and requires rules for what happens
if an agreement cannot be fulfilled. This is in contrast with Negotiations,
where players often do not do what they promise (ECO-18). It is also worth
mentioning that introducing Trading gives players a tool to self-balance a
game. If one player is in the lead, others may refuse to trade with them,
or force them to accept less favorable trade. This is a soft Catch-the-Leader
mechanism (VIC-18).

Market

Description
Players may buy from or sell resources to Markets, where prices and quantities
can vary.

Discussion
Markets are a specialized form of Exchanging (ECO-01), as players are typically
exchanging stocks or commodities for money, all of which are resources.
However, there are some specific considerations for this implementation,
particularly around changing prices. Note that we are defining a Market
mechanism as one where prices change. Mechanisms like that, found in
Concordia, where you can buy or sell for a fixed value throughout the game
would fall under Exchange, even though it is called a Market.
One mechanism for varying prices is using a track as in Supremacy, where
there is a price track for each commodity, with a marker indicating the current
buy/sell price. If a player sells that commodity the price is reduced, and if they
buy it the price increases. If a player buys or sells multiple units, all units can

248

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

either be sold at the same price prior to adjustment (as in Supremacy), or it
can drop one space with each good sold (as in Crude). While the latter makes
it more difficult for players to exploit the system, it makes the calculations a
bit more complex.
Price tracks can be 2-dimensional grids, as in the 18xx series. In those
games, selling shares makes prices move down within a pricing column, while
issuing dividends moves it to another column with a different price scale. This
gives more fine-grained control to the design, and there can be special effects
when the price hits the top or bottom of a row or column.
Rather than have a marker record the current price, the actual commodity
tokens can do so. This is done by placing one commodity per space on the
pricing track. The price of the commodity is based on the farthest space up
the track covered by the commodity, or sometimes the farthest visible space.
As commodities are bought, higher price spaces are revealed, and as they
are sold, the higher price spaces are covered so the price drops. Visually, the
former method usually calls for numbers to be printed above or below the
track spaces, which takes up more room, while the latter allows the numbers
to be printed on the track spaces themselves.
This elegant track system is used in Crude, Power Grid, and others. When
players take a resource off the track, they simultaneously are adjusting the
pricing for that resource, without having to remember to do anything else.
Wealth of Nations adds a twist in that the buy and sell prices are not the same
in each space. There is a delta that creates friction in the market system.
Markets can sometimes be one-way ratchets. In Acquire, players may only
buy shares from the market, not sell them. And as the hotel chains they
represent expand, the price of the shares goes up, and can never go down. In
other cases, like Rococo, prices for thread and fabric go down throughout the
course of the turn, decreasing as each player makes purchases. This ostensibly
models the decline of prices in a bazaar as closing time approaches and is also
helpful for balancing first-player turn-order advantage.
Market systems create a lot of player interaction, as players may attempt
to manipulate the price to their advantage or deprive their opponent the
ability to gain needed resources. They also help to self-balance resource
production. If one resource is being over-produced or under-used by
the players, the price will be driven downwards, and players will adjust
accordingly. In a system where the physical resource tokens are placed on
the market track, they may even become completely unavailable if players
are hoarding them.

Delayed Purchase

Description
Items that are purchased do not enter play right away but arrive on a future turn.

Discussion
In most games, when you purchase an item, it is immediately available to
use. However, in the real world, it can take time to produce something, or
get something delivered.
Several games use this Delayed Purchase mechanic to force players to plan
ahead. A simple implementation is to place purchased items directly on a

Economics

251

turn track, and they become available when the turn marker moves into that
space. This can also be done with a specialized production or training track,
where units are advanced one box each turn. This was used in Time War,
where Teams are trained by advancing them through a schematic of a training
facility. Each turn, they move one box through the facility, and when they
reached the exit they are fully trained. However, players can remove teams
early, but then they are only partially trained, and less effective. In Star Wars:
Rebellion, ship construction is managed this way too. But various special cards
can move ships down the track, accelerating production.
Strategic wargames use this production track mechanism, but have wanted,
for realism purposes, to have different durations to produce different units.
For example, an infantry unit might take a month, while an aircraft carrier
might take a year. Because of the number of units being built, moving tokens
from box to box is unwieldy, so designers created the Production Spiral. When
units are being built, the tokens are placed by following the spiral arm out
from the current month until the matching unit type is found. The tokens
are then placed in the section of the arm. When the Month marker is moved,
all tokens in that wedge become available to the player. World in Flames is a
good example.
Another way to implement this is to place purchased items into a discard
area, as is common in deck building games like Dominion. Here the delay
before the purchases are available is randomized, since the discards are
shuffled before creating the draw deck. This can create an issue with games
with a fixed number of turns, as items that are acquired late in the game
may never see play. This can be avoided by making late game purchases just
worth Victory Points, or by having a special shuffle towards the end of the
game. Core Worlds uses that latter technique, as the discards may be shuffled
in before the final turn, regardless of whether the draw deck is depleted or
not. While not guaranteeing that cards purchased at the end will be drawn,
it does increase the chances.

Income

Description
Players gain resources at defined times.

Discussion
To foster a sense of growth and forward progress, most games with economic
elements have some form of Income, where players receive additional
resources. This is a large topic, and several specific mechanisms discussed
in this chapter fall into this category. See “Automatic Resource Growth”
(ECO-06), “Loans” (ECO-07), “Exchanging” (ECO-01), “Market” (ECO03), and “Random Production” (ECO-12). However, there are some broad
generalizations that can be discussed.
First, the designer needs to consider the timing of when Income is received.
It can be scheduled, player-controlled, or random. Brass and Eclipse are
examples of games with scheduled Income phases. They come at a definite
point in the sequence of play, and players can plan around that.
Player-controlled systems rely on players to take actions that result in Income.
Typically it is self-controlled: a player makes a decision to take a Production
action that generates resources (as in Global Mogul), or sells something via a
Market (ECO-03). However, in some systems, part of a player’s Income may

Economics

253

rely on the actions of other players. For example, in Le Havre and Caylus, a
player gains Income if other players use their buildings (ECO-14).
This increases player interaction and rewards players that consider their
opponents’ positions. However, this is typically implemented as only a portion
of a player’s Income, and not a significant one.
There are games where all, or close to all, of a player’s Income is dependent
on other players. In Container, players produce and ship containers. But other
than taking loans, you may only gain money by enticing another player into
purchasing one of your containers. As can be expected, this makes these games
a lot less forgiving, and subject to social pressures. Container in particular has
this reputation.
Income can also be random. Roll and Move games like Monopoly
typically incorporate this. Players either rely on others landing on their
property spaces, or passing Go to collect money. But there are other more
sophisticated systems for randomly allocating resources. See Random
Production (ECO-12) for details.
Games can also be Open Economies or Closed Economies. In an Open
Economy, there is a bank that pumps more resources into the game system.
In contrast, in a Closed Economy, all the resources that exist are already in
player hands, and they just move between players during the course of the
game. The vast majority of games are Open Economies. This helps foster
a sense of progress and is easier for designers to balance. An example of
a Closed Economy game is Dream Factory, which is discussed in detail
in the (appropriately named) Closed Economy mechanism in Chapter 8,
“Auctions.”

Automatic Resource Growth

Description
Resources held by a player will automatically grow over time.

Discussion
In the purest form of this mechanism one or more resources increases by a set
amount (usually one) each turn. This allows the designer to gradually ramp
up player power in a simple and intuitive manner.
A popular example of this is in the digital card game Hearthstone. The
resource Mana is used to play cards. The Mana available at each turn begins
the game at one and is increased by one at each turn until it reaches a maximum
of 10. This gives the game an arc, as the options are much more restricted at
low Mana values, and complexity and combos are gradually introduced. It
also encourages players to balance their decks. If they only select cards with
high Mana values, they will not be able to play for several turns. But if they
only select low Mana cards, they may run out of cards quickly as they play
multiple cards per turn later in the game.
A variant on this system has unused resources grow. Thematically, this can
be expressed as bank interest or as breeding animals. Agricola uses the latter

Economics

255

option. If a player has two or more of the same type of animal, they gain an
additional one. This encourages efficiency and can force players into deciding
the value of using resources now, versus having more for later.

Loans

Description
Players may take a Loan from the bank to get more money.

Discussion
Many games with money allow players to borrow. These can serve several
purposes for the design. First, they can be punishments for players who
do not manage their money properly, and exist to keep those players in
the game. But they can also provide a means to victory, giving players
resources required to jump-start their engine, or complete a big project. In
fact, some games, like Railroad Tycoon: The Board Game, essentially require
taking Loans to be a part of a winning strategy. Designers need to be careful
to frame the concept of Loans in their game to incentivize players in the
appropriate way.
There are several varieties of Loan mechanisms in games, around the way
they are paid back, and other effects they have on the game. In some games,
Loans are never paid back during the game. They simply count against a
player’s final money totals or victory points.
In other games, such as Railways of the World, players pay interest each
turn based on bonds they have issued (another way of representing Loans).
Whenever a player wishes, they may take a bond certificate and $5,000. Each
turn they must pay $1,000 per bond, and bonds may never be repaid. Players
lose one victory point (VP) for each bond they have at the end of the game.

Economics

257

In Brass, players may use an action to take a loan of $30. This never has to be
repaid, but immediately reduces ongoing income.
Wealth of Nations adds a few wrinkles to this system. Each Loan gives cash
in declining increments ($20 for the first, $19 for the second, and so on), but
can be repaid for $25. Any Loans held at the end of the game reduce the score
by 3 VPs.
In Monopoly, players may take Loans but need to disable one of their
properties to do so. Flipping a property allows the player to take the mortgage
value from the bank. While it is flipped, the player may not collect rent if
someone lands on the property. To unmortgage a property, a player must pay
the mortgage value plus 10% interest. Other than the loss of the use of the
property, there is no penalty for having a property mortgaged through the
entire game. By rule, players must mortgage properties when faced with a cost
that they cannot pay. This mechanism takes choices away from players, while
needlessly extending a trailing player’s long, slow, death spiral. Designers
should avoid this type of mechanism.

Always Available Purchases

Description
Certain resources are Always Available to Purchase, while others may not or
may be limited in quantity.

Discussion
This mechanism has traditionally been used in Deck-Building games
(CAR-05). In Ascension: Deckbuilding Game, for example, there are two
basic actions for players: purchasing an available card or attacking a card.
In addition to a rotating queue of cards in the center, there are three cards
that are always available: Heavy Infantry and Mystics are always available
for purchase, and Cultists are always available to be attacked.
Having these cards gives a safety valve for players who face a board filled
with high-level cards that they cannot afford, or early in the game when their
hands may be weak. These cards are weaker than standard cards but are a
reasonable consolation prize in case players get stuck with a low-value draw
or allows them to use excess purchasing or attack power.
Dominion does not have random cards in the center, so the cost range
of the cards is more constrained, and there is almost always something
affordable. However, this mechanism is still used in the form of coin cards.
Having these standard cards helps players develop a sense of value and gives
them a target to know what they need to do to gain the highest scoring
Province cards.

I Cut, You Choose

Description
One player divides a set of resources into different groups. Other players have
first choice of which group to select.

Discussion
This I Cut, You Choose mechanism is based on a technique that parents often
use with two children who are, for example, dividing up a bar of candy. One
child breaks it into two pieces, and then the other selects which one they
want. This ensures that the one doing the dividing is incentivized to make it
as equitable as possible, because they know the other will take the larger piece.
In general, when this mechanism is used, it is between two players. For
example, in San Marco, players are paired up each turn, and one is designated
to divide drawn cards into two stacks. Then the other player selects which
stack they want to keep.
This mechanism forces players to consider a wide variety of factors, both
present and future, to put together offers that will entice the choosing player
to pick the desired stack while giving them as little as possible.

Economics

261

Some games, like New York Slice, extend this mechanism beyond two
players. In New York Slice, one player divides a stack of pizza ingredients into
several stacks equal to the player count. Then, going clockwise, each player
selects one stack, with the dividing player getting the last one remaining. In
this multiplayer variation, it is next to impossible for four or more divisions
to have even roughly equivalent value, so it is customary for each player to
have equal turns being the divider.
For this mechanism to be interesting, the value of each division can’t
be obvious. True value for each player must be hidden or obscured. The
most common way to do this is by integrating a variety of Set Collection
mechanisms, which is the go-to method for having the same thing be worth
different things to different players. See Chapter 12 for full details.

Discounts

Description
A player can obtain an asset at a reduced cost.

Discussion
In the typical implementation of this mechanism, players accumulate
Discounts that make future purchases less expensive, these Discounts
persist, and they stack (build on each other). These characteristics make this
mechanism well suited to create an engine-building effect, where players are
able to achieve more as the game continues.
In Splendor, for example, cards are obtained by cashing in gems (ECO-01).
Many of these cards Discount all future purchases by one or more gems. As the
game progresses, it becomes easier for players to obtain more expensive cards,
as they need fewer gems once they take the discounts into effect.
7 Wonders takes Discounts to an extreme by allowing players to acquire
a card at no cost if they have the prerequisite building. This is distinct from
an Upgrade mechanism (ECO-11), as the original card is retained. It is not
converted into the new building—it merely allows for its acquisition at no

Economics

263

cost. However, these Discounts are not fungible. They only apply to the single
building specified on the card.
One of the earliest examples of Discounting is Civilization. Technology
advances (called Civilization cards) gives players Discounts towards a specific
category of Civilization card, usually the same category as the card itself. For
example, Music, which costs 20 and is in the Art category, gives a 10 Discount
towards any future purchases in Art for the rest of the game. This encourages
players to specialize in certain areas. It also helps to create a Technology Tree
(ACT-16) without actually defining any prerequisites, by having the most
advanced cards be so expensive that they realistically can only be obtained
through Discounts.

Upgrades

Description
Assets may be Upgraded to improved versions.

Discussion
Upgrades share many characteristics with Discounts (ECO-10), but with
some distinctions. Typically, they are implemented by first representing the
action or ability with a card or tile, and then replacing it with a better version,
or adding another card or element to it to show its improved status.
Implementing Upgrades can nudge players to specialize, particularly if
it is much more expensive or even impossible to go directly to the upgraded
resource without the lower-level resource. As such, this can also be used to
implement a Tech Tree (ACT-16).
A specialized form of upgrade is seen in train games such as 1830 and
other 18xx games. Early in the game, players place yellow tiles, which have
simple single-track sections. Later, they may place more complex green or
brown tiles that include overpasses and junctions. However, when upgrading
a tile all existing track must be preserved. This limits the types of upgrade
tiles that can be used and creates competition and bottlenecks for certain
limited key tiles.
Some games force upgrades through obsolescence. At certain points, the
game advances to a new stage (ACT-15), and some items may become obsolete
and be discarded. The 18xx games use this mechanism by having trains go
obsolete, constantly forcing players to reevaluate their board position and
future growth.
The physicality of the upgrade is typically done by replacing a card or tile;
however, sometimes it is done by rotating or flipping. Maiden’s Quest and Flip
City make full use of this option by having players rotate or flip cards within
a deck to increase (or reduce) their strength. While this gives designers a lot

Economics

265

of flexibility in a small space, it places a burden on players to shuffle properly
and maintain orientation. Other means for upgrading include adding a new
card or card portion. Mystic Vale does this with clear plastic cards, each of
which is populated in its top, middle, or bottom third. Layering the cards
together enables all three sections to be seen at the same time. Cards are not
the only elements that can be upgraded, nor the only way to show upgrades.
In Monopoly, a property can be improved by adding houses, and eventually,
hotels, to it. In Catan, settlements can be upgraded to cities, each represented
by a different token.
Upgrades are a common mechanism outside of the specific economic lens
taken in this chapter. From promoting pawns in Chess to leveling up characters
in a dungeon crawl, to adding a fortification to a territory or hex, Upgrades
represent a means of investment that increase player power, contribute to
narrative, and help players create connections to elements in the game.

Random Production

Description
Resources are generated from a random process and distributed to qualifying
players.

Discussion
The Random Production mechanism was introduced in Crude but was
popularized in Catan. In both of these games, players begin their turn by
rolling two dice. In Catan, the die result determines which tiles activate,
and any players with settlements or cities touching that tile receive resources.
In Crude, the dice activate both the related row and column for the active
players, and either the related column or row for their neighbor.
This mechanism keeps all players involved on other players’ turns, by
offering the possibility of gaining resources. Players must remain flexible in
their planning, since they can’t guarantee resource production, or the specific
mix of resources they’ll get. There’s also a slot machine effect, as players may
hit a small “jackpot” if they hit a needed number.
This system was extended by Machi Koro by defining special abilities that
only trigger on a player’s turn, or that only trigger on other players’ turns.
This was further refined in Space Base, where each ability card has two
sides. The blue side has an ability that triggers on your turn. If the card is
replaced, it rotates to its red side, and now triggers when an opponent rolls

Economics

267

that number. Since, in games with more than two players, there are more
opponent turns than your turns, getting cards to their red side is an important
strategy.
A weakness of these systems is that they can be susceptible to player
perception of streaky dice rolls. In actuality, given the number of dice rolls
in a typical game of Catan, it is inevitable that some numbers will be rolled
more than average, which means that some will be rolled less. This introduces
