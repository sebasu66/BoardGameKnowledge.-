incentive to collect during the game. Set collection is one of the older mechanisms found in
gaming—­showing up in older games like Gin Rummy (1909) and Monopoly (1935).

263

It’s quite popular in modern games as well. In Ticket to Ride (2004), you collect sets of cards
to lay down trains and complete routes. In Azul (2017) you collect matching tiles to earn
points. We’ve already talked about the escalating points “dumpling scoring mechanism”15
from Sushi Go (2013), which is also found in other games including Bohnanza (1997), Tokaido
(2012), Valley of the Kings (2014), Cascadia (2021), and more.
When designing set collection games, keep in mind that the individual set components can
be just about anything, as long as there are common characteristics between the set items.
“Collect green” can mean the color of the cards or the items shown on the cards such as trees,
dollar bills, or green slime monsters. This type of set collection can be done with any type of
components if they share common characteristics: cards, tokens, or dice can have the same
shape, color, text, or pattern to compose a set. You can also collect sets with no commonalities. The game of SET (1988) is a great example of all the variety that can be done with this.
Often with set collection, players can either “turn in” their collection on their turn for points
or collect sets that are scored at the end of the game.
The other type of set collection is collecting a group of thematic components that when the
set is assembled, the player receives some sort of permanent bonus—­such as if a medieval
knight were to collect a helmet, breastplate, and shield—­completing a set of armor and
receiving a defensive bonus during the remainder of the game. Or sets can be collected to
form an engine that generates resources for the player. See the “Engine-­Builder” section presented earlier for more details.

Trading/Deal-­Making
Trading and deal-­making require players to trade resources with each other. Trading can
happen on a player’s turn, like in Bohnanza (1997); it can happen on a designated trading
round as in Traders of Genoa (2001); or it can happen at any time during the game as in Pit
(1904)—­creating a chaotic flurry as bidding. However, it can be challenging to get players to trade.
Sometimes players are reluctant to trade. You must encourage them from the start of the
game. You need to encourage players using the rules of the game by creating a mandatory
trading round or have a dedicated trading round to get them used to trading. The secret to
getting players to trade is to make sure that they have a surplus of resources that are not very

Known to math nerds as a “Triangular numbers.”

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

useful or even useless to them but are useful to other players. My personal theory on getting
players to trade is this:
1. If a player has only one of something (resource, coin, etc.), they won’t trade it because
they think that they might need it, that it will have value later in the game, even if it
doesn’t have value for them now.
2. If a player has two of something, they still might not be tempted to use it because they
believe that even if they spend one thing (resource, coin) now, they might still need the
other one later.
3. But if a player has three or more of a resource, then they will be more apt to trade it,
especially if they realize that another player has a resource that they want.

Rondels
A rondel is a wheel-­shaped board on which you move a pawn in a certain direction—­usually
clockwise. The board is divided up into several actions—­like slices of a pie—­and on each pie
slice is an action. When your pawn lands on that slice, you perform the action. In games with
rondels, the player usually has a limited number of spaces the pawn can move each turn—­for
example, you can move up to three spaces.
In some games, pawns cannot occupy the same space on the rondel and are “bumped” to the
next space. This can thwart your plans, and you must wait to travel all the way around
the rondel until you can use this space. It is common for players to not be able to perform the
same action twice in a row in a rondel game.

265

266

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Good games to play that utilize a rondel include Vikings (2007), Heaven & Ale (2017), and the
games of German game designer Mac Gerdts including Antike (2005), Imperial (2006),
Navegador (2010), and Concordia (2013).

Victory Track
A victory track is a section of a board or a sideboard on which the player’s points are
tracked during the game. A victory track is a great way for you to visualize who is winning
during the game; it also encourages other players to advance along the track, giving a game
the feeling of a race.
In some games, there are bonuses given to players for reaching a space on the victory track
first, while other games give lagging players a catch-­up bonus to help them keep up with the
pack of players.

Gaming Is for Everyone
There is one more trait that has emerged from Euro-­gaming, and that is inclusiveness. The
benefit is that the more players feel welcome to your gaming table, the more players will want
to play. Many designers have realized the importance of inclusiveness—­whether it is addressing a disability or rethinking the presentation of a game’s themes and components. These are
three ways that game designers can be more considerate and inclusive with our designs:
■■
■■
■■

Color blind accessibility
Language dependency
Character diversity and portrayal

Color Blind Accessibility
Not all players perceive colors the same way, resulting in difficulty perceiving components
and information during play. To address this, I suggest the following for your game’s
graphic design:
■■

■■

Be aware of the types of color blindness. Red and green are the classic combinations,
but there are others as well. I use an app called CVSimulator to perceive colors the way
those with color blindness do and steer away from using colors that are too close to
each other.
In addition to colors, patterns, icons, textures, and words can help players distinguish
between cards. In 2017, Hasbro did just this when it released a color-­blind-­friendly
version of its card game UNO.

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

Language Dependency
If you want to sell your game in another country or if your game becomes successful, it may
be translated into other languages. But translating games requires being able to speak (or at
least write) in that language.
Rather than relying on Google Translate, consider hiring a translator to do the work for you.
It’s a worthwhile investment especially since a translator can communicate your game’s rules
and theme better—­or, even better, strive to keep the text in your design to a minimum.
Games with less words tend to get translated more often because only the rule book requires
translation.

Character Diversity and Portrayal
For decades, board games have been primarily created by male European and American
designers. As a result, most characters in board games were represented as male Caucasian
characters. There were some exceptions, but more than often that was the case.
Modern designers recognize this and have been striving to make changes throughout the
industry. This means having characters in your games that are different races, gender, ages,
and even sexual orientation (when appropriate). Representing characters of only one race or
gender, especially if your game takes place in modern or futuristic times, just doesn’t make
much sense.
Players like to see themselves represented in games, and it sends an especially important
message to your players that by showing people of all types are in your game, then all are
welcome to play your game! Board gaming thrives when all can play; don’t make your game
an exception.

Let’s Design a Euro-­Game
Now that we know the mechanisms used in a Euro-­game, let’s think about how to design a
game. Many Euro-­games are named after geographical locations, so we should do the same.
Instead of naming the game after a location in Europe, let’s use a location in America that
inspired me.
Riverside, Illinois, was the first planned community created in the United States. Created in
1869 by landscape designer Frederick Law Olmstead, Riverside is a quaint village designed to
exist in harmony with its landscape.16 Our Euro-­game Riverside is a worker placement game
where you will be building homes for points.

Components of Riverside
Let’s start by gathering and creating our components. Nothing says “Euro-­game” to me like
cubes and meeples, so let’s grab several of those! If you don’t want to take parts from an
existing game, you can buy them online at sites such as Amazon.com, The Game Crafter,
Print and Play, or Mercadi. Just look for 8mm wooden or plastic board game cubes and
16 mm wooden or plastic meeples.

We’re going to need 30 cubes—­six cubes in five different colors—­and 24 meeples (or pawns),
again, six for each player in four different colors. We’ll also need a first player token. This can
be anything from a cardboard token to a toy or miniature. It should be something that can be
easily passed around from player to player during the game.
Next, let’s make a board. First, get a black pen, and sheet of 8″×11″ paper (or A1,
59.4×84.1 cm) and draw nine squares on it like this:

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

Within those squares, we are going to designate the actions the player can take, like
Figure 8.1.
If it helps to color code the squares, then do so. You’ll need colored markers of five different
colors (red, blue, yellow, green, and brown). Sadly, this book is printed in black and white.
Next, to create a deck of cards, you will need 26 blank cards for the game. Refer to Chapter 5
on how to make (or buy) blank cards.
On each card you are going to draw the following numbers and images:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Six cards with the number 1 on them and two squares each. Color each square with one
of the five colors (i.e., red, blue, yellow, green, and brown). Do not repeat the colors.
Five cards with the number 2 on them with two squares each. Color each square with
one of the five colors. Do not repeat the colors.
Five cards with the number 3 on them with three squares each. Color each square with
one of the five colors. Do not repeat the colors.
Five cards with the number 4 on them with four squares each. Color each square with
one of the five colors. Do not repeat the colors.
Five cards with the number 5 on them with six squares each. Color each square with
one of the five colors. Do not repeat the colors.

Step 1: Create the Rules
Riverside is designed to be a simple worker placement game—­one that teaches a player the
basics of the mechanism. The following is the first draft of the basic rules for the game.

Riverside Rules for Two to Four Players
Setup
1. Place the board in the center of the table.
2. Place all the cubes within reach of all players.
3. Each player picks a color. Give each player three meeples of their designated color.
Place the rest within reach of all players.
4. Shuffle the cards and create a market of cards equal to the number of players plus one.
5. The player who is reading these rules takes the first player token.
Gameplay
1. The first player places a worker meeple onto the board to collect a resource or perform the action. Workers are placed from left to right. If there are no spaces left to
place a meeple, then you cannot place it there. When a worker is placed, collect the
resource, or perform the action.
2. Going clockwise, players take turns until they have placed all their workers on
the board.
3. Once all the workers have been placed, they are returned to their owners.
4. The first player who builds 12 points worth of buildings wins.

Step 2: Playtest the Game
Now that we have the basic rules, let’s play! Gather some friends to play! Don’t forget to try
the game with different player counts.
When I played with two players: _________________________________________
When I played with three players: _________________________________________
When I played with four players: _________________________________________
What were your playtester’s reaction to the game? Did they find it too confusing or too easy
to play? How long did it take to play? Like I’ve said before, getting an accurate playtime of the
game is important information about your game.

Step 3: Change the Rules
Riverside is a fine game, but what can we do to make it even more interesting? My biggest
issue with the design right now is that it doesn’t feel like we’re building a city. Perhaps if
there were different types of structures, then it would give the game a little more variety.
Let’s go ahead and give each of the building cards names. The 1-­point cards are “houses,” the
2-­point cards are “parking lots,” the 3-­point cards are “parks,” the 4-­point cards are “stores,”
and the 5-­point cards can be unique structures like “theater” or “post office” or “town hall.”
Now let’s change some rules.

Riverside Rules for Two to Four Players
Setup
Same as before.
Gameplay
1. The first player places a worker meeple onto the board to collect a resource or perform the action. Workers are placed from left to right. If there are no spaces left to
place a meeple, then you cannot place it there. When a worker is placed, collect the
resource, or perform the action.
2. Going clockwise, players take turns until they have placed all their workers on
the board.
3. Once all the workers have been placed, they are returned to their owners.
4. You must build buildings next to each other by lining up the cards as you build
them. However, you cannot build certain buildings next to each other:
5. You cannot build a park next to a parking lot.
6. You cannot build a store next to a house.
7. You cannot build two unique structures next to each other.
8. The first player who builds 12 points worth of buildings wins.
Following these new rules, our town might look something like Figure 8.3.

Did that make the game better or worse? Was the game more challenging or more frustrating? Don’t forget to playtest these new rules!
When I played with two players: ___________________________________________
When I played with three players: __________________________________________
When I played with four players: ___________________________________________
See if you can come up with a rule change of your own. Go ahead and write it down and
playtest it!
The rule I changed is: _____________________________________________________

Step 4: Change a Number
Let’s change something about the game. It could be the number of worker meeples the players start with. (Two instead of three? Four instead of two?) It could be the number of spots
on the board where you place meeples. What if there were only two spaces under the “build 1
building” space? What if all of the resource spaces had two worker spaces instead of some of
them having three?
Remember, when you change a number, you change the experience. Play around with these
variables. These are the “knobs” we can turn to adjust the design. Don’t be afraid to turn
things all the way up or down to see what happens and how your game breaks as a result!
Don’t forget to playtest these changes!
The number I changed was: ______________________________________________
What happened when I changed it was:
________________________________________________________________________

Step 5: Change the Objective
If I’m adding or changing an objective, I like it to still work thematically with the game I’m
making. In this case, we’re still building a town, so maybe the goal is to build a 3×3 grid of
buildings—­still using the existing placement rules. The player with the most points after
doing this, wins the game. Let’s rewrite the rules to reflect this change.

Setup
Same as before.
Gameplay
1. The first player places a worker meeple onto the board to collect a resource or perform the action. Workers are placed from left to right. If there are no spaces left to
place a meeple, then you cannot place it there. When a worker is placed, collect the
resource, or perform the action.
2. Going clockwise, players take turns until they have placed all their workers on
the board.
3. Once all the workers have been placed, they are returned to their owners.
4. You must build buildings in a 3×3 grid, placing the cards within that grid as you
build them. However, you cannot build certain buildings next to each other:
■■ You cannot build a park next to a parking lot.
■■ You cannot build a store next to a house.
■■ You cannot build two unique structures next to each other.
5. The game ends when one player’s grid has been filled.
6. The player with the most points in buildings wins.
Figure 8.4 shows what that 3×3 grid might look like.
What happened when I playtested this new objective:
________________________________________________________________________
My new objective is:
________________________________________________________________________

Step 6: Add a Mechanism
Here’s where things get interesting. Let’s change a mechanism. A large list of them to choose
from was presented earlier. I’ll wait while you go back and review them.
When adding a mechanism, you want to make sure it is something that complements your
existing mechanisms. Depending on what you pick, you might need to add components.
That’s fine if the game is light on components like Riverside is, but you want to avoid what’s
known in the video game industry as feature creep.

CHAPTER 8

L et ’ s M a k e a E u ro - ­S t y le S trateg y G ame

Figure 8.4 A 3×3 grid example

Feature creep is when you keep adding mechanisms and components to your game. It is a
common problem for new game designers to get bored with their designs or find them too
easy to play (after several playtests) and as a result keep adding elements to the game to
compensate.
There are a few problems with this. First, game designs are often a delicate balance of elements, and piling things onto your design might disrupt what is good about it in the first
place. Second, adding rules and components and mechanisms to a game adds to its
complication—­both in the rules and testing the game. These complications can add confusion for your players and length to the playtime. Third, the more components you add to the
game, the higher the cost of production will eventually be. We’ll talk more about this aspect
of game design in Chapter 10. Let’s not worry about all of that right now. We are experimenting, so don’t let reality stand in our way!
If I were going to add a new mechanism, I would add a trading mechanism where players can
trade either resources or building cards with each other. However, we might need to increase

275

276

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

the number of resource tokens or cards to accommodate this. What about you? What mechanism would you add?
My new mechanism is:
________________________________________________________________________
What happened when I playtested this new mechanism:
________________________________________________________________________

Step 7: Change the Theme
Finally, let’s change the theme. We can do this with a light touch, such as we are building
structures on Mars. Our houses become biodomes, parks become oxygen scrubbers, parking
lots are space ports, stores are trading posts, and unique buildings could be radar dishes,
hydroponic labs, and alien zoos! By just changing the names and maybe some visuals, we
have a slightly different game.
Sometimes changing the theme can change the entire game and might even necessitate
changes to objectives, components, and mechanisms! A big change like this might require us
to go back and redesign the game! You must be careful with retheming, especially if your
gameplay mechanisms are tightly tied to the theme! I once had a publisher interested in a
game design of mine, but he wanted to change the theme. He tried for a year to come up with
a different theme, but every time we playtested the game with each new theme, it just didn’t
feel the same. He eventually gave up and returned the game to me unpublished.
Don’t let that discourage you from retheming Riverside. Go ahead and come up with an interesting new theme. You could take inspiration from other Euro-­games and make it about
building a castle or a medieval town or have the game take place in ancient Egypt (of course,
you would want to build your cards in the shape of a pyramid!). Go ahead and write your new
theme down here.
My new theme is:

Carcassone is a tile-­laying game that popularized the term meeple. There are dozens of
expansions and variations including The Ark of the Covenant (2003), Mists over
Carcassone (2022), Carcassone Gold Rush (2014), and Carcassone: Star Wars (2015).
Ticket to Ride designed by Alan Moon has players completing train tracks to connect
cities. Like Carcassone, it has lots of great expansions and a variety of maps to play.
Stone Age is another great gateway game that uses the worker placement mechanic. It’s
easy to learn and quick to play and very thematic for a Euro-­game.
Pandemic is a cooperative Euro-­game where players race against the clock to prevent
the global outbreak of disease. The game can get very tense! Expect not to win!
7 Wonders has players drafting decks as they build the wonders of the ancient world.
It’s a little more complex than the previous games, but it’s a good game to introduce
the concepts of resources, engine-­building, and card drafting.
Wingspan is another good engine game with some lovely production values (art and
components). If you like birdies, then you might like this!
Lord of the Rings by Euro-­game designer powerhouse Reiner Knizia (who has more than
700 published games to his credit!) doesn’t always design thematic games, but this one
is a doozy. It captures the race to Mt. Doom and the pursuit of Sauron so well that it
hardly feels like a Euro-­game, and yet it almost single-­handedly introduced cooperative
gameplay to the industry. A classic.
T’Zolkin the Mayan Calendar might come off as gimmicky—­a worker placement game
that plays on a series of rotating gears that double as rondels—­but not only is it a
crunchy game but a beautiful one.
I liken Karuba to Indiana Jones meets Bingo. It’s a fascinating game in which all players
are given the exact same resources, but what you do with them is what matters.
Flamecraft is a charming worker placement engine-­builder designed by my pal Manny
Vega. From its charming artwork (by Sandara Tang) to its “You help me, I’ll help you”
gameplay to its adorable components (buttered toast meeples! So cute!), this game is
a delight.
The Quacks of Quedlinburg is a fantastic bag-­builder where you push your luck to draw
potion components without busting. It’s fast to learn and addictive to play. If you get
the opportunity, upgrade the tokens with the resin ones sold at BoardGameGeek
.com. You’ll never look back!

LET’S TALK ABOUT Eurogaming’s older cousin—­the genre known as thematic games
also known as American-­Style games but most commonly known as Ameritrash. I know
that the term Ameritrash sounds insulting, but only if you don’t know it’s fascinating history.
Despite its title, Ameritrash descends from the convergence of no less than three different
genres of tabletop gaming, two of them European in origin: the English parlor game, the
German Kriegspiel or war game, and the American role-­playing game.

A History of Thematic Games
We’ve seen that before the 1800s, most board games were thin on theme. Senet, Chess, and
Hounds and Jackals have what is called representative theming, where traces of theming
are present, but it doesn’t permeate the entire game. The rest of classic board games like
Backgammon and Nine Man’s Morris fall squarely into the abstract game category.
Things changed in 1800 when George Fox published The Mansion of Happiness: An Instructive
Moral and Entertaining Amusement. Using a “track-­style” board layout like Snakes and Ladders
(and what you created earlier in this book!), The Mansion of Happiness structured its gameplay
around a narrative—­in this case, a 66-­space spiral track depicting virtues and vices—­with
the player’s goal being to reach heaven at the track’s end. The game was later published by
American game makers Parker Brothers in 1894, where it became a popular game played in
American homes. Milton Bradley’s version of the game, The Checkered Game of Life, is later
reinvented as the Game of Life (1960).

282

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Games like The Mansion of Happiness and The Checkered Game of Life created the foundations
for American board gaming: a track-­style board, pawns representing players, and a spinner or
dice to randomly determine movement through a thinly themed journey-­style narrative.
This model served as the foundation for the American board game until about the 1960s.
Board games of this type were published with admittedly pasted-­on themes such as Uncle
Wiggly, Candy Land, Buck Rogers, Huckleberry Hound, James Bond, and Batman. Even to
this day, this style of roll-­and-­move game is what most Americans think of when they are
asked to describe a board game.
Meanwhile, over in Prussia, Lieutenant Georg von Reisswitz created his version of the
German war game KriegSpiel. Invented in 1780 by German mathematician Johann Hellwig,
KriegSpiel was an attempt to simulate warfare on the tabletop in a more detailed manner
than Chess provided. In his excellent book It’s All a Game,1 author Tristen Donovan explains
how von Reisswitz creates a three-­dimensional play environment—­a sandbox if you will—­
that better simulates the terrain of a battlefield.

to demonstrate his creation. Von Reisswitz upgraded his game into a sturdier version featuring highly detailed and painted porcelain miniatures and modular plaster terrain pieces that
could be reassembled in a variety of ways to represent any battlefield. The game became the
favorite pastime of the king and his sons and inspired them to utilize maneuvers first developed on the game board in real battles.
The young princes continued to improve upon the game, adding dice to determine artillery
effects and replacing the tiles with actual military maps. By the fall of 1824, KreigSpiel had
become part of Prussian military training, and clubs dedicated to the game existed all across
the kingdom.
KriegSpiel proved to be a successful tool in Prussia’s battles against France, and it was soon
adopted as a military training and a planning tool by other nations. The commanders of
World War I and II rely on tabletop simulations to plan their battle strategies.
Meanwhile, a Lighter Version of Kreigspiel was being played in Victorian parlors—­complete
with miniature towns and cork shooting pop-­gun cannons. Victorian authors Robert Lewis
Stevenson and H.G. Wells enjoyed playing this game. Wells penned the first war gaming rulebook entitled Little Wars: A Game for Boys from Twelve Years of Age to One Hundred and Fifty
and for That More Intelligent Sort of Girl Who Likes Boys’ Games and Books. Despite these codified rules, the miniature game outlined in Little Wars remained a niche hobby.

In 1957, French film director Albert Lamorisse invented a faster, lighter version of KriegSpiel
that he called La Conquête du Monde or The Conquest of the World, which Parker Brothers
bought and retitled Risk (1959).
Traditional war gaming picks up again in the 1950s, thanks to Jack Scruby and his War Game
Digest, a quarterly publication aimed at war gamers. The community of war gamers grew
around the digest including manufacturers of miniatures. In 1962, publisher Avalon Hill
started its own war gaming periodical called The General and attracted the interests of a
young Wisconsin war gamer and writer, Gary Gygax, who created gameplay scenarios and
several articles for the magazine.
Traditionally, KreigSpiel focused on the Napoleonic wars between France and Europe, but war
gamers of the 1950s and 1960s started to introduce other conflicts onto the tabletop such as
the American Revolution, the American Civil War, trench warfare of WWI, and the campaigns of WW2.
Despite all this variety, Gygax and his fellow war gaming friends burned out on these historical battles and turned their attention to the European medieval period of knights and castles.

The Adventure Is Yours
Gygax, a long-­time fan of science fiction and fantasy, concluded that if there were knights on
the battlefield, why not magic-­using wizards like Merlin? Why stop there? How about adding
a dragon or giant like those found in medieval fairy tales? Gygax and Jeff Perrin teamed up
to create the fantasy gaming system Chainmail (1971).
Meanwhile, Gygax’s war gaming friend David Arneson concocted a scenario for his own
medieval-­themed war gaming group—­a siege against a castle. The party entered the castle
through the dungeon but ended up having so much fun battling the guards and exploring the
twisting hallways that they didn’t want to leave!
The real breakthrough came when Gygax and Arneson realized that their players especially
loved the story-­telling aspects of their games where they became the heroes of their own
story. Their players demanded that they play the adventures several times a week. The two
designers transformed Chainmail into a new set of rules that focused even more on storytelling and character-­building. It ended up being equal parts KreigSpiel and the fiction of Robert
E. Howard, J.R.R. Tolkien, and H.P. Lovecraft. They called it Dungeons and Dragons (1974).

Dungeons and Dragons, or D&D, hit the gaming world like a bomb. Gygax created a company,
Tactical Studies Rules (TSR), to sell the hit game. As D&D started to heat up the tabletop
gaming world, Dave Meggary, one of Arneson’s players, noticed that Arneson was doing all
the work as the dungeon master while the rest of the players were having all the fun. He
designed a streamlined board game version of the Dungeons and Dragons experience called
Dungeon! (1975).
Dungeon! was the first of a new breed of board game; it bears resemblance to the roll-­and-­
move games of old but incorporates the combat and strategy of KriegSpiel and the storytelling and character advancement of D&D. It’s also the world’s first dungeon crawl game!

Dungeon crawlers is a subgenre in which a party of (usually) fantasy heroes explore an
underground complex—­often a network of caves or the hallways of a castle dungeon—­in
search of treasure. More often, they encounter horrible monsters, deadly traps, and head-­
scratching puzzles that bar their way.
This subgenre has become incredibly popular over the years. Notable dungeon crawl games
include DungeonQuest (1985), HeroQuest (1989), Descent: Journeys in the Dark (2005), Arcadia
Quest (2014), and Massive Darkness (2017). There are non-­fantasy-­themed dungeon crawlers
too including DOOM: The board game (2004), Level 7: Omega Protocol (2013), Shadows of
Brimstone: City of the Ancients (2014), and Star Wars: Imperial Assault (2014).
My favorite dungeon crawler is: _______________________________________

Meanwhile Over in England
Jon Peake, Ian Livingstone, and Steve Jackson ran a board game store called Games
Workshop when they discovered D&D and became obsessed. They started a mail-­order service to import TSR’s games and publish their own board game version of D&D called Talisman
(1983), a dice-­rolling, track-­moving fantasy board game with a snarkier edge, distinct artwork, and wicked take-­that gameplay. Many consider Talisman to be the first modern
Ameritrash game. . .despite it being created in England! Games Workshop has since published some of the most Ameritrashiest games: DungeonQuest (1985),2 Blood Bowl (1986),
Chainsaw Warrior (1987), Space Hulk (1989), and the Warhammer series. Thanks to the success of TSR and Games Workshop, the tabletop market expanded, and soon game stores
were popping up across the United States and the United Kingdom.
American board game publisher Milton Bradley bought the rights to several previously
published independent games and republished them in ultra-­deluxe editions called the
Gamemaster series. The highly thematic strategy games in the Gamemaster series were all
bangers: Axis and Allies (1981), Broadsides and Boarding Parties (1982), Conquest of the Empire
(1984), Shogun (1986), and Fortress America (1986). Each game was a lavish production that
included scores of plastic miniatures, illustrated maps, and plastic scenery models, all packed
in gigantic “coffin”3 boxes.

DungeonQuest was an English-­language reprint of the Swedish game Drakborgen (1985).
Gamers would joke that the boxes were so big that they could be used as a coffin.

CHAPTER 9

The Gamemaster series titles are considered prime Ameritrash—­especially Fortress America,
a strategy game with a theme clearly inspired by the plot of the 1984 action movie Red Dawn.

The Secret Origin of Ameritrash
Ameritrash games filled the mass-­market shelves in the late 80s through the early 2000s.
Dark Tower (1981), Fireball Island (1986), Thunder Road (1986), HeroQuest (1989), and The
Omega Virus (1992) found their way into the homes and hearts of young gamers. These gamers soon found their way onto the Internet, which had become the place to discover, discuss,
and debate board games. In an early Internet thread entitled “Dog Eat Dog” posted on
January 8, 2000, on Google’s gaming forums,4 poster Kaspian first mentioned the term
Ameritrash.
In the same thread, Robert Hutnik writes, “I think [this] is a reason why I dislike most games
produced in America. Why is it, [as] a rule, they are bound to produce games run amok with
randomness, and the old Parcheesi method of dice rolls governing movement on a track-­like
structure? Come up with a novel game theme and then slap it on the same old brain-­dead
game mechanics.”
The term Ameritrash then turns up again in Robert Martin’s geek list on BGG: “A Tribute to
Ameritrash.”5 In it, Mr. Martin makes a tongue-­in-­cheek list of the traits that make up an
Ameritrash game: dice, fantasy/sci-­fi/horror/military or sports theming, excellent titles, millions of chits, insane rulebooks, chrome, plastic minis, slews of cards, franchise tie-­in, nukes,
gadgets, garish artwork, guns, player elimination, conflict, and randomness. It’s worthwhile
to note that these are all traits found in either the Gamemaster’s or Games Workshop’s published titles.
While the term Ameritrash is used in Kaspian’s post as “American games are trash,”
Mr. Martin uses it in a more tongue-­in-­cheek manner, as a play on the term Eurotrash, which

288

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

was a popular term in the early 90s. Eurotrash first referred to a certain style of techno-­pop
music that originated in Europe but later was used to refer to the fans of that music—­rich
European socialites, especially those living or working in the United States. It was never a
term of endearment.
To the Ameritrash fan, the title is not an insult but rather a celebration of over-­the-­top theming, the excessive “chrome” found in the game, the tons of miniatures, the gimmicky gameplay elements, and the unpredictable randomness that creates high moments of drama
during the gameplay. The Ameritrash community has embraced the term in the same way
that garage rockers of the 1970s embraced the insulting term punk and made it their own.
Unfortunately, not all gamers view the term this way. They find it insulting or even distasteful. In 2006, on BGG’s forums, the discussion came to a head as the user boards were
inflamed by a series of debates about which was better: Eurogames or Ameritrash games.
Things got emotional, feelings were hurt, and members were banned. Since then, the two
groups generally decided to leave the other alone to their own style of games.
Others have attempted to create alternate classifications for the genre such as Amerigame,
Amerithrash, dramatic game, but I like the term. I think of Ameritrash as a term of fondness,
in the same way that friends will sometimes jokingly insult each other. Ameritrash captures
the spirit of excitement and trashiness of the genre in the same way as “grindhouse” movies
and “trashy” novels.
I find that the term thematic game captures the same spirit without sounding like an
insult to the game or its creators. What would you call them?
I call them _____________________________________________________.
No matter what they are called, the best distinguisher between Eurogames and thematic
games is that Eurogames are about managing resources, whereas thematic games are
about managing chance. Recently, modern board game designers have been merging the
two genres. Are games such as Fearsome Floors (2003), Terra Mystica (2012), The Voyage of
Marco Polo (2015), and Blood Rage (2015) considered Eurogames or thematic games?
Who’s to say?

BGG user Sphere writes, “. . .people are forever trying to assign games to clearly defined
­buckets. Thankfully good designers are cleverer than that and borrow from one another, and
in doing so blur those lines. A sensible approach would be to stop worrying about which
camp lays claim to which game and enjoy each on its own merits. . . .”

Sounds like good advice to me!

Traits of Thematic Games
Let’s take a closer look at the traits that make thematic games so different than all other
game genres. It stands to reason that if you want to design a thematic game, you first
need a theme.
I find theme to be a funny word. Not ha-­ha funny, but odd in its usage. According to the dictionary, theme is defined as “a unifying or dominant idea, motif, etc., as in a work of art.”6
Examples of theme are “good versus evil” or “greed is good” or “absolute power corrupts.”
Many board games have these kinds of themes, but the term theme as it is most used by the
board gaming industry and community is as a replacement for “topic” or “subject matter” as
in “the theme of this game is space pirates.” I sometimes use the term story genre (as compared to game genre) when referring to theme, but since theme is the commonly used
term, let’s stick with it.

As you remember from earlier, themes are a shorthand to help classify games. They inspire a
designer when making creative design decisions. Theme helps players remember the rules.
They let players play pretend. They help a player choose which game to play or buy. The
themes of thematic games are often geeky subject matter like the following:
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Fantasy—­Games dealing with fantastical worlds and creatures such as found in
Dungeons and Dragons or The Lord of the Rings.
Science fiction—­“Hard” sci-­fi like The Expanse or Star Trek or “soft” sci-­fi like Star
Wars or Warhammer 40K
Horror—­Creepy, spooky, or frightening games including favorites like Zombies and
Lovecraftian horror
Adventure/pirates—­Games that allow you to be characters such as Indiana Jones
or Jack Sparrow, or at least unlicensed versions of them
Superheroes—­Games that emphasize action and combat, which makes superheroes
a great subject matter for thematic games
War—­A genre that might be dwindling, but in the earliest days of thematic gaming,
this was the most popular theme of all with its focus on war and war-­related topics

What theme are you most interested in? ____________________________________
What theme do you dislike the most? _______________________________________
There are many, many more themes than are in this tiny little list. Some general themes like
horror or science-­fiction have subgenres like slasher or cyberpunk. You can even combine
themes to create a hybrid theme like sci-­fi horror!

Intellectual Property
Some board game companies pay big money (up to hundreds of thousands of dollars) to
license intellectual property (IP). Many game designers want to make games based on
their favorite IP. I have seen unlicensed game prototypes created by fans, but since they
don’t own or have access to the IP, those games will probably never get published.
But how do you design a game with an IP? There are a few ways to approach it.
If you have an idea for a game that is based on an IP, you can only pitch it to a publisher who
has the rights to that IP. You’ll have to do your research to find out who owns the rights to
the license.
This isn’t commonly found information, but you can intuit who has what rights by seeing
which publishers are publishing licensed games. Some IPs are treated as multiple licenses
that are sliced up like bread—­with different parts of the license going to different publishers.
One publisher might hold the rights to card games using an IP, another to board games using
an IP, and yet another might have the rights to make a miniatures game using the IP. The
older and more established an IP is, there might be different versions of the same license! For
example, DC Comic’s Batman is divided up in the following ways:
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

Batman from the comic books
Batman the animated series
Batman from the movies (each movie is usually treated as a different license)
Batman ’66 (the old TV show)
Batman appearing in the Super Friends cartoon
LEGO Batman (which is a dual license that requires working with and paying two
licensors!)

Since I don’t work with DC Comics, I’m sure there are other sublicenses that I’m not aware
of. These sublicenses only allow the publisher to work with the elements from those specific
licenses. For example, if you were making a Batman the Animated Series game, you probably
couldn’t use a Batman villain from the comic like the Killer Moth because he never appeared
on that show.
Have you ever wondered why so many board games are themed to zombies and the Elder
God Cthulhu? That’s because these monsters are in the public domain. That means no person or company owns the rights to these characters.

291

292

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Anyone can make a game using these public domain characters. Characters in the public
domain include the Lovecraftian Elder Gods, Dracula, Alice in Wonderland, Robin Hood,
Zorro, Sherlock Holmes, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Wizard of Oz, characters from fairy
tales, and the heroes, gods, and monsters found in various mythologies.
However, you must be careful which version of a character to use. You can use Alice and the
characters found in the Wonderland books, but you cannot use the version of the characters
from the Disney animated film or live-­action movies as they are still protected by copyright. Being protected by a copyright doesn’t mean you can’t make games using those characters, but this intellectual property must be licensed from their copyright holders.
For example, Ravensburger had the license to the movie ALIEN. I was contacted by their
creative director and asked to submit a pitch based on the ALIEN movie license. I didn’t
“own” the license, but I was asked to design something using it. Other designers had been
contacted and (presumably) submitted their own pitches, but it was my design that was good
enough to “win” the deal.
If the IP that you are pitching isn’t held by a publisher (there are still a few out there), you can
always try to get the rights yourself. To do this, you can each reach out to the license holder
and ask them how much the license costs. This could be an expensive process, but it is doable. If you have thousands of dollars to spend (or hundreds of thousands depending on the

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

license), there’s nothing stopping you from securing an IP on your own, but it helps greatly
to have a publishing partner. The IP holder wants a guarantee that the game will come out as
well as be good (in that order).
Another way to gain access to an IP is to directly reach out to the IP’s creator and form a partnership. I’m working on a design with an artist friend of mine who holds the rights to his
comic book creations. I’m designing the game, and he is doing the art.
However, if you really must design a board game about Batman but you don’t have access to
the license or have connections to the publisher that holds the rights, then I suggest you
create your original superhero character instead. Or create your own Legend of Zelda. Or your
own Star Wars. That’s what the designers of Tokyo Sidekick (2018), Tiny Epic Quest (2017), and
Rayguns and Rocketships (2017) did! Once you do that, now you are the IP holder. Perhaps
there will be a game designer who will want to make a board game about your intellectual property!

Any Theme Can Be a Game
What I love about board games is that they can be about any theme, no matter how mundane, nerdy, unusual, or bizarre. Here are just a few more examples:
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■
■■

Romance: Marrying Mr. Darcy (2014)
The fashion industry: Prêt-­à-­Porter (2010)
Quilting: Patchwork (2014)
Beheading royals in the French Revolution: Guillotine (1998)
Standing in line: Kolejka (2015)
Being a frog that eats galaxies: Cosmic Frog (2020)

I always try to reinforce the theme of my game designs using mechanisms. You can create
some powerful moments in your game when you let your theme guide your design and game
mechanisms. For example, one of my favorite thematic mechanisms in all of board gaming is
the Haunt roll from Betrayal at the House on the Hill (2004).

293

294

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Every time a player reveals a new haunted item, there is a chance it will trigger the Haunt—­a
bad event in which one of the players might be revealed as a traitor who tries to kill the other
players. When the Haunt item is revealed, you roll dice. If the number of Haunt cards in play
is larger than the number rolled, then the Haunt is triggered.
What’s so great about the Haunt Roll is that it will eventually happen, but players don’t know
when it will happen. This mechanism perfectly simulates the tension and dread when searching through a haunted house.
This is a great example of the mechanism being tied to the theme. The gameplay should
match the theme in a thematic game. If someone is playing a fantasy game, they would
expect there to be dungeons and dragons and wizards. A player would expect to find magic
swords and treasure and to level up.

CHAPTER 9

L et ’ s M a k e a T hematic S trateg y G ame

If a game doesn’t match your expectations, then you might experience Ludo narrative dissonance.7 This is the feeling you experience when a game “doesn’t feel right” or a mechanism “doesn’t make sense” because it conflicts with the theme. One way that this can happen
is if the game’s theme is “too weird.” I have a theory called the triangle of weirdness8 that
states this:
