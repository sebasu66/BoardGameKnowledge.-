We can graphically represent various player life goals, and how metagame features
connect their achievement to the underlying game, by drawing circles for the goals
and connecting lines for the supporting features (thicker lines represent stronger
support for those features) (figure 7.2).
Note that depending on the limitations of the game, it can be hard to support some
of these things. There is not much call in a game like roulette, say, for rating systems,
professional leagues, or strategy guides.6 On the other hand, a richer game like soccer
has enormous scope for supporting almost any goal a player might have (figure 7.3).
Or, directly comparing the metagame strengths and weaknesses of the Pokémon trading
card game and the Pokémon GameBoy cartridge, see figure 7.4.

much thought.

Status and money are better supported by a card collection than by a cartridge collection or even the collection of Pokémon creatures in-game. On the other hand,
during gameplay, the fantasy of owning and caring for creatures exhibited in the
cartridge game is stronger than the one presented in the card game. Socialization is
best supported by the face-to-face play of the card game; achievement and knowledge
are well supported in both games.
It can be useful to detail as completely as possible the metagame potential of a
game. Along with the thickness of the arrows, one can consider how expensive the
various metagame aspects are to produce for the game’s publisher. For instance, a
player’s desire to achieve money or its equivalent might be efficiently satisfied in a
trading card game by making sure price guides are published and well distributed.
Perhaps the underlying skeleton of the trading card game can be changed, for example
by increasing the relative rarity of certain cards, in order to facilitate this. Caution
must be exercised because changing the basic skeleton of the game might alter the
metagame in many ways. The above change to card rarity could potentially make
the game less amenable to the goal of personal achievement if it nudges the game
away from one of skill for the average player and toward one of initial monetary
commitment.
Of course, none of these diagrams comes close to listing all the features that support
the various goals (and many features support multiple goals, so a perfectly accurate
diagram would be an impenetrable thicket of arrows). Any value the diagrams have
comes more from the process of making them and thinking consciously about which
features support which goals and how, rather than in the end result.

Characteristic: Conceit/Motif

When we speak of a game’s conceit, we take conceit in the sense of an extended metaphor. Some games are purely abstract, such as go, Tetris, or poker, but most nonsports
games are at least metaphorically “about” something. Games with a conceit might

Figure 7.5

Superstructure

213

have a very light one, in the sense that chess is vaguely about medieval warfare, or
they might have a more elaborate conceit, in the way that Starcraft is about science
fiction warfare or Tomb Raider is about swashbuckling archeology. If the game also
tries to model its (possibly imaginary) conceit, it is to some degree a simulation: PanzerBlitz surely qualifies, Tomb Raider probably doesn’t, but Counter-Strike probably does.
In any case, a game’s conceit can provide a great deal of motivation and explanation
for the action: imagine, for example, how much less compelling Clue would be as a
purely abstract boardgame.
Many games (e.g., almost all computer role-playing games) have stories, which
are a special kind of conceit. We don’t use the word story to refer to conceits in
general, though, because chess and Monopoly don’t have stories, but they do have
conceits. Conceit for us carries a similar meaning to what is often called “motif” or
“theme.”
Sometimes people talk about the “intellectual property” of a game, meaning something similar to what we mean by conceit. We’ll only use the term intellectual property
when the conceit is something licensed or licensable—that is, something ownable. So
a Star Wars RTS has Star Wars as its IP, but chess does not have an IP—its conceit,
medieval warfare, is in the public domain.7 Note that even a game not in the public
domain can have a conceit that is public, and thus not “IP” in the sense that we use
the term. For example, the game Squad Leader is not in the public domain, but we
consider it a game whose conceit is not intellectual property, because World War II
(which is Squad Leader’s conceit) is in the public domain—you can’t own World War
II or license it out (although you could license the Squad Leader name itself).
Sports, and many older boardgames and card games, have no real conceits. But
from around 1900 on, most deliberately designed games have had conceits. There have
been a few exceptions, such as Scrabble, Pente, many party games, Othello, Sorry, and
Uno (note, however, that many of these are repackagings of classic games). But there
are far more games that do have conceits. Some examples, just to name a few at
random, include Clue, Doom, Risk, Battleship, Starcraft, and the various Final Fantasy
games. One of the early examples of a conceit that was added on top of an existing
game mechanic (in this case, the race boardgame) was the Royal Game of Goose, which
dates back to the sixteenth century.8 Today most games have conceits added to them—
7. Note that from a legal point of view, intellectual property includes things like trademarks and
copyrights, and (controversially) even the code itself in a computer game. We don’t use the term
in this way (or in any legally sound way—we aren’t lawyers), and when we say IP we just mean
“the ownable part of a game’s conceit.” Our apologies to those with legal knowledge; our use of
the term IP, while doubtless quite odd to a lawyer, is very common in the game design
community.

sometimes in a manner that is tightly integrated with the game mechanics, but sometimes simply to give the game more flavor.
The same game can come in different versions, one with a conceit and one without.
For example, Uno has no conceit, but Doctor Who Uno does.
In some cases, particularly with sports, an abstract game almost becomes its own
conceit or even its own IP. Think of baseball, say: the rules are public domain, and
the game has no conceit in that it is not a specific representation of something else
in the way chess is a representation of medieval battle. But there is a whole world
around professional baseball: history, legends, heroes, customs, and so on. And in fact
Major League Baseball itself is owned, and people can and do license it. Similar comments apply to most popular sports, and to a few other games like poker as well (to
some extent, they apply to almost any game that’s played professionally, such as chess,
Magic, or Starcraft). Perhaps the right way to think of this phenomenon is as an IP for
the metagame more than for the game itself.
Note that very generic conceits, ones that are in the public domain or at least are
well known to the players,9 provide to the players a lot of information about how to
play the game. For example, in Magic, you know to expect that a dragon is more
powerful than an ogre, which in turn is more powerful than a goblin; you have a
rough idea what to expect from a card named Fireball or Lightning Bolt; if a card is
named “Sword of X” or “Shield of Y” you’ll know it somehow helps attack or defense
respectively. Similarly for chess: you know that the king is the most important piece,
followed by the queen, and that the pawns are least important (the middle pieces are
vague, though, and you may be surprised by the weakness of the king). If you create
a unique, nonstandard IP for your game, you have the advantage of something that’s
easier to own from a legal standpoint, but it will be harder for people to understand
how to play your game, even if the mechanics are no more difficult: this is what makes
Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri, for example, harder to wrap your head around than Civilization II. In particular, abstract games (those with no conceit at all, such as tic-tac-toe)
need to have very simple rules10—playing a purely abstract game with the complexity
of Civilization II or World of Warcraft would be all but impossible. One way to view all
this is as an example of standards—conceits provide standards that help players know
what to expect, but the information is coming from the real world (or well-known
fantasy worlds) rather than from the world of game rules.
9. Examples of conceits that are not in the public domain, but that have fairly general cores and
thus are very familiar to the players, are the generic fantasy conceits of Dungeons & Dragons and
of Magic. Although these worlds are rich in detail, the basics—goblins, dragons, ogres, knights,
and so on—are known to everyone.
10. Note that although it must have simple rules, the game itself need not be simple—go is
perhaps the ultimate example.

Superstructure

At an extreme, there are simulations: games that have a conceit and attempt to
model it very closely. The more rules that are in the game not for pure gameplay
reasons but because “that’s how it works in real life,” the more the game is a simulation. In Uno, there are no rules that model “real life”; in Civilization or World of Warcraft
there are quite a few; in Squad Leader there are an enormous number. Full simulations
tend to be very complex, and thus tend to have fairly small audiences. But games that
are partially simulations are much more common. For games that are not in any way
a simulation, worries about realism are not an issue—no one complains that Uno is
“not realistic,” because it is not trying to be. But once a game begins to simulate reality,
the issue of how far to go in that direction rears its head. Partial simulations often
have issues revolving around the compromises between “realism” (modeling the world
they simulate) and optimizing the fun of the gameplay. Different players will have
different ideas of where the game should fall. For example, different editions of Dungeons & Dragons have been more or less focused on simulation, and versions that have
made D&D more like an abstract game have sometimes been met with dismay by those
who want the game to be more of a simulation of a fantasy world.
When a game is highly realistic, those who don’t like realism tend not to complain,
but simply go elsewhere. As an extreme example of realism over gameplay, there are
hex wargames that model one-sided historical battles in such a way that the forces
that won historically are essentially guaranteed to destroy the opposing forces during
the course of the game (the player controlling the losing side “wins” by staving off
defeat for a longer time than would normally be expected). Such a game, with its

built-in loss for one side, would be unsatisfying to many, but those who desire accurate
simulation will accept the odd gameplay logic.
Licensed Games
Many boardgames and computer games have for their conceit an intellectual property
that they have licensed from someone else. This is a modern phenomenon and thus
is not found in classic games (in their original forms) or sports. A game that uses a
license has the advantage that it can get started more quickly—it comes with a builtin potential audience. However, when the licensed property dies, so does the game.
Also, the game is unlikely to be successful with people who do not care for the IP;
people rarely buy a Babylon 5 boardgame if they don’t like Babylon 5 (although they
might buy a generic merchant trading game or an Egyptian-themed boardgame just
because they like boardgames, even though they don’t care for mercantilism or
Egyptology).
As an example, in 1965 Milton Bradley released a card game based on the TV show
and movie Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. It was based on Crazy Eights. It’s long since
forgotten. Six years later, another game based on Crazy Eights was released, but it did
not have a license, or indeed any conceit at all. It was called simply Uno. The two
games were not identical, and it would be wrong to assume that the difference in
licensing was the only cause of the differences in the two games’ fortunes. But
although being nonlicensed is by no means a sufficient cause for achieving classic
status, it is close to a necessary one.
So using an existing license usually means gaining some initial success at the cost
of breadth of appeal and potential for longevity. If you’re the first to market with a
new and exciting kind of game (e.g., you’ve invented the first-person shooter or the
trading card game), you might want to avoid licensing and have a fairly generic conceit
(which might evolve into a real IP over time, as with Warcraft). If the market is already
crowded with games like yours, you might want to license a popular IP to help you
stand out. However, even in a crowded market one can sometimes be successful with
a nonlicensed game and perhaps have a long-run hit; licensed games will almost never
be long-run hits.11
Note that if a conceit gives a great deal of added value to the consumer, to the
point of being one of the main reasons for buying the game, that conceit is almost
always a licensed IP. Being able to interact with that IP is one of the rewards for playing
the game. You buy a Battlestar Galactica game because it’s about Battlestar Galactica.
You don’t buy Fallout because of the Fallout IP; even with a very powerful property
11. Computer games are rarely long-run hits anyway, due to technology (although there are
exceptions like Tetris and Starcraft), which might be a factor pushing more computer games
toward licensing.

Superstructure

like Warcraft, not many people are buying it for the Warcraft IP (they might be buying
it because of the Warcraft name, which they feel represents quality, but that’s a different matter).12
In general, games are not the best format in which to get people to like a new IP—
something else had to get you to like Battlestar Galactica before you bought the
boardgame. Books, movies, and television are all much better, probably because they
are better at telling stories, and stories are what make people love IPs.
Licensed games are often not very high-quality,13 perhaps because goodness is not
why people buy those games, so why spend money making them that good? There
are of course exceptions—for example, there are several good Star Wars computer
games. Perhaps the reason is that the Star Wars license is worth so much money, and
costs so much money, that you can afford to spend some cash making the game good
as well; perhaps it’s because there are enough other Star Wars games out there that
you have to compete; or perhaps it’s because the Star Wars license is long-lasting
enough that you can hope to have your game last longer, so that making it a good
game is a better investment.
Sometimes an IP is deliberately designed to fit together with a game. This is fairly
common for (nonlicensed) computer games, but less so for paper games. One notable
group of exceptions includes a number of Japanese trading card games: Pokémon, Yugi-oh, and Duelmasters, for example.14 These games are also notable in that there is a
game inside the IP itself, with the game the player plays being a mirror of the game
the characters in the IP play. Done right, the presentation of the IP in various ways—
books, comics, TV, various toys, and perhaps multiple games—can become powerfully
reinforcing. Oddly enough, the dynamic here is not that different from the dynamic
of sports, where a person who likes a sport might play, watch, and follow the “backstory” (personal lives of players, personalities of coaches, and so on), with all of these
activities potentially supporting one another.
One tension between many licensed IPs and the games that use them is the socalled Batman problem:15 if you have a game that uses the Batman IP, who gets to be
Batman? Many strong IPs have just one or two main characters, and most have a rela12. Also, while not many people may have bought existing Warcraft games for the IP, it’s imaginable that significant numbers of people might buy the next Warcraft game for the IP, because of
the power of World of Warcraft. It’s possible that MMORPGs (or RPGs generally) do a better job
of getting people to fall in love with an IP than other kinds of games.
13. Granted, as Sturgeon’s law says, 90 percent of everything is trash. But licensed games seem
to do even worse than average.
14. People think of the Pokémon IP as being designed for the original Pokémon GameBoy game,
but in fact it was designed with both the handheld game and the trading card game in mind.

tively small number (which is what makes for good stories). Games, however, often
call for more characters, and they may need more flexibility with those characters
than the story allows. So making such a game involves some tough choices. If, in your
Batman game, the user is not allowed to be Batman, it probably will not feel much
like a Batman game. You might have Batman appear in cameos throughout the game,
but then the player will not feel very important or heroic in comparison. On the other
hand, if the player is Batman, you are pretty much locked into a single-player game
(unless you want multiple Batmans running around), and if the game has its own
storyline, it will be constrained to some degree (both by the licensor and by player
expectations). These restrictions can all be fine for a platformer or a single-person FPS,
but become very problematic for a paper RPG or an MMO. This is yet another example
where a single-player game’s requirement to satisfy only one person at a time is a
powerful advantage.
Story/Narrative
Story or narrative is often part of a game’s conceit, but it does not have to be. Chess,
for example, has a conceit but no story. Story in games is a fairly new phenomenon,
and almost exclusive to the computer world. Traditional boardgames and card games
never have explicit stories, and newer ones very rarely do. Even computer games rarely
if ever had stories in the early days (e.g., Space Wars, NetHack). Now almost all computer games have significant story elements, and the exceptions tend to be confined
to certain genres, such as rhythm games, simulations (including sports), and puzzle
games.
Although many computer games have stories, those games may take the story more
or less seriously. At one extreme, Doom and Quake lead programmer John Carmack
has said that “story in a game is like a story in a porn movie; it’s expected to be there,
but it’s not that important.”16 And in Doom, this statement is arguably true—but the
many fans of the Final Fantasy games, well known for their stories, would probably
not agree with Carmack’s viewpoint. Some players who enjoy games like Doom gnash
their teeth in frustration at the many cut scenes that games like Final Fantasy use to
tell their stories, and yet there are players who enjoy both types of games. Even games
like Doom or Diablo that have fairly minimal stories can get good value out of them,
in terms of setting player expectations, helping to make mechanics more understandable, and providing some extra motivation for gameplay goals. Such basic stories,
however, are a far cry from the ones that the best of the story-rich games create, stories
that create truly memorable characters that players care about.
There are a few examples of story in noncomputer games, such as paper role-playing
games, choose your own adventure books, and murder mystery games like How to Host
16. Kushner, Masters of Doom, 128.

Superstructure

a Murder. However, these are exceptions rather than the rule, and they are all fairly
modern.
Why are detailed stories so rare in precomputer games? Part of the reason is that a
simple conceit can provide much of the help a game needs, in terms of adding interest
and flavor to a game and helping the player understand more complex rules. So story
is not absolutely necessary. And before the computer, options for presenting story in
a game were very limited: mostly pure text, which many players might not want to
stop and read during the play of a game. Reading chapters of Le Morte d’Arthur between
turns of chess, for example, would not make a very satisfactory game experience.
Another factor is that story is hard to present in multiplayer games—whatever method
is used to present it will require time, and some players will be more inclined to spend
that time and others less so, leading to problems with downtime. Since single-player
games were less common before the computer era, that may have left less scope for
story. Lastly, there is some difficulty in combining story and game generally.
There is a certain tension between some of the elements that make for a good game
and those that make for a good story. Playing a game involves choices, and those
choices can go in different directions; repeated plays of the game will be different.17
These different outcomes are all equally valid (or at least many of them are). But with
a good story, the outcome will feel in some way inevitable—other alternative outcomes
will not represent as good a story. And a good story can be read again and again, even
though it is the same every time. If a game plays the same way every time that is
usually not a good thing—games rely on uncertainty in outcome in order to work.
When a strong story is included in a game, it can sometimes make the game less
replayable—a game like Final Fantasy VII, with strong story elements, may be less
appealing to play again (you know how the story will come out) than a game like
Diablo that has a weaker story.18 All that said, the powerful visual and audio presentations possible in a computer game make presenting story very enticing. Many highly
successful computer games rely heavily on story, and much academic work examining
the role of story in computer games has been done.19
17. As Chris Crawford puts it in The Art of Computer Game Design, “The difference between [stories
and games] is that a story presents the facts in an immutable sequence, while a game presents
a branching tree of sequences and allows the player to create his own story by making choices
at each branch point” (p. 10). This book is available online at http://pdf.textfiles.com/books/
cgd-crawford.pdf.
18. Adventure games, such as The Longest Journey, are inherently less replayable due to their
puzzle-solving nature. Thus they make a natural home for a strong story, since any lessening of
replayability due to story does little harm.
19. The interested reader might wish to look, for example, at some of the essays in Salen and
Zimmerman’s The Game Design Reader as well as at their Rules of Play, chap. 26; Wolf and Perron’s
The Video Game Theory Reader; and Crawford’s On Interactive Storytelling.

Characteristic: Spectation

Two games might be equally fun to play, but one is much more enjoyable to watch
than the other. This characteristic of a game—how amenable it is to watching—we
call “spectation.”20
Spectation includes everything from a TV audience for poker, to fans at a baseball
game, to people at a bar casually watching a game of darts, to family members at home
watching a game of Monopoly that they’ve decided to sit out of. Variables include the
size of the audience, the formality of the viewing (e.g., purchased tickets to a sporting
event versus watching a game between friends), and the game itself (watching chess
is different than watching soccer). Normally people think of sports when they think
of people watching a game, but in fact almost any game can be watched.
Sports do, however, generally have very good spectation. The initial demands
placed on the viewer in terms of specialized knowledge tend to be fairly low: a fiveminute explanation could be enough for someone to watch a soccer game. Imagine
watching a chess game after a five-minute explanation. And yet the watcher of a sports
game will still gain considerable extra enjoyment by being highly knowledgeable—
sports do no worse than nonsports games in this regard. As we will discuss below,
sports tend to have relatively few impediments to spectation in other areas as well.
In general, single-player games are not as good for spectation as multiplayer ones.
Much of the enjoyment of the spectators comes from watching the human drama of
competition. So even if a single-player game is easy to follow—think, say, of card
solitaire—it may not be as exciting to watch as a head-to-head battle. Even for singleplayer games, though, spectation still matters, because it is a big part of how new
players are brought into the game. If it is easy to watch someone else play, understand
20. We will also use the word spectation to refer to the act of watching a game. Context should
make the intended meaning clear.

what they are doing, and imagine oneself having fun doing the same, the game is
more likely to spread. So even a game that will never become a spectator sport can
gain from spectation as a form of marketing. In the digital world, on average, arcade
games do best here, followed by console games, with PC games in last place—this rank
order is natural enough, given the physical environments (and in particular, the availability of spectators) where each of these game types is found.
If one thinks of games as evolving and competing organisms, in the sense that they
change over time and become more or less prevalent, it’s clear that good spectation
is a big bonus for a game. Players will usually feel better about their choice of game
knowing that people want to watch it. An audience may inspire them to want to play
better, which in turn may make them spend more time playing and practicing so as
to improve their skills. Members of the audience are in some sense participants in the
game, and some of them may decide to become players later on.
Spectation After and Before the Game
Spectation does not even have to happen at the same time as the game itself. Watching a game can be interesting even if one knows the outcome. A newspaper article

222

Chapter 7

written about a game that happened the previous day is an example of delayed (and
filtered) spectation—a friend describing the game to you is another.
Games that have distinct highlights rather than a more or less continuous stream
of action tend to do better here, because they are easier to recount in a condensed yet
still interesting form.21 In this sense, football is probably better than soccer, which is
still better than basketball, and a marathon is worse than any of them. Another reflection of how easy it is to condense the events of a game can be seen in the amount of
information that can usefully be given in something like a box score. Poker as commonly played at home is decent in terms of how well it can be recounted—many
roughly similar hands are played, but there are often some big wins and losses to talk
about—but tournament poker is even better, because players can be eliminated on
single big hands.
Games can be interesting to talk about or watch even before they happen: witness
the pregame shows so common in sports. These can vary widely in content, from
human-interest stories (the troubled home life of the big star who is about to play) to
very detailed analyses of game strategy. Note that this variation is, like so much else
that we discuss, both agential (How much does the intended audience know about
the sport? What will they be interested in hearing?) and systemic (there is more to
say about different plays to execute in football than there is about different ways to
run fast in a sprint).
Impediments to Spectation
One way to think about spectation is to consider what factors impede it. Agential
impediments tend to revolve around the amount of technical knowledge required to
watch the game. Must I be a player to watch effectively? Must I be a good player? Can
expert commentary make up for lack of knowledge on my part? Can I even understand
the expert commentary if it’s provided?22 How much attention do I have to pay to
enjoy the game—can I take breaks?
21. This is a sense in which narrative construction is extremely important for all kinds of games,
including ones not thought of as having a narrative. Usually when people discuss narrative in
games they mean something much narrower: a story that is contained within the game, such as
the plotline of an RPG. As discussed above, there are pros and cons to story in games in this
narrower sense, but in the broader sense of being able to talk about what happened in a game,
story is an entirely positive feature.
22. Note that camerawork can be thought of as a kind of commentary: a selection for the viewer
of some subset of information out of all the possible information available. Anyone who remembers the atrocious camerawork in the early days of televised soccer in the United States will know
what a difference it makes. Both commentary and camerawork can help or impede spectation,
either because of quality or because of the level of audience knowledge they assume.

The amount of attention one must pay is not entirely systemic—it depends on how
the game is presented and on what the viewer knows—but some systemic impediments are important. Obviously the overall complexity of the game is a big factor. It’s
more work to watch and understand a game of chess than a footrace. Even at the same
complexity level, though, the amount of game state information in a single moment
is a big factor. Poker is a complex game, but between hands the state information is
very simple: How many chips does each player have? Someone who stops watching
and then starts again is at no great disadvantage. Chess is a lot worse, but at least
all the state information is directly visible, if not easily comprehensible. An RTS is
horrendous: a highly complex visible state, plus much state information that may
not be visible at all (e.g., unseen areas on the map, or how far into each tech tree a
player is).
Most sports tend to have a very simple and easy-to-understand state: there is just
one really important thing to know, namely the score.23 Other things might also be
important, like who currently has possession, but they are quickly gleaned from
looking at the game by someone whose attention has wandered (or who has just
returned from the restroom). Football is somewhat of an exception: one wants to know
the current down and the number of yards to go until a first down. It is not a disaster
if one loses track, since a viewer can simply wait until the next first down, at which
point she again has complete state information. But television spectation in football
made a big leap forward with the introduction of the strip at the bottom of the screen
listing the down and yards to go (not just the score), and another step forward with
the electronic colored line showing the location of the line to gain the next first down.
So presentation improvements can make up for systemic difficulties.
Spectation relies on the viewer’s understanding not just of positional heuristics but
strategic ones as well. What is a good move? What is an amazing one? Sports have an
advantage here again due to people’s innate understanding of real-life physics. A brilliant move in an RTS may return only blank stares from all but the most hardcore
spectator. A Dr. J dunk from the foul line will be seen as amazing by everyone. Similar
situations occur with a diving catch or with the thunderous roars and amazing speeds
of racecars.
Systemic impediments are often visual. How easy is it to see the game from a distance? Is it easy to use cameras and microphones to good effect? Are the results of
player actions clearly visible (computer games often score especially badly here—think
of a player using hotkeys to build something in an RTS)? Is there important hidden
information in the game?
23. Arguably, two things: score and time remaining. The latter can be at least roughly estimated,
though, even by someone who has otherwise lost track of the game state.

PC games often fare poorly at spectation, with small screen sizes and little use of the
spectators’ physical intuition. Contrast this state of affairs with sports, where the “screen
size” is very large, and much activity is easily understandable due to the spectators’ unconscious understanding of physics. The spectation problems of PC games are not necessarily
critical given that opportunities to view other people’s games in progress are often limited
anyway. Coin-op arcade games, however, give better opportunity to view others’ games,
and enhanced spectation can lead directly to increased revenue due to the ease of impulse
purchases. Taken together, all these facts imply a higher value to ease of spectator understanding for arcade games. Perhaps the emerging dominance of fighting games with
humanoid characters and motion-capture technology appears more predictable from
looking at spectation than from looking at any other gameplay characteristic of the progenitor of these games, namely Karate Champ.

Spectation and Hidden Information
Hidden information’s impact on spectation is perhaps worth a few more comments.
Here we are considering the common case of a game with multiple players, each of
whom has access to her own private information. In general, the more information
is hidden, the worse the game’s spectation—draw poker is less interesting to watch
than stud poker. Audience members don’t necessarily want to follow the game from
the point of view of a single player, but revealing information belonging to multiple
players for the benefit of the audience can annoy the players. Both of these facts can
be seen in the common occurrence of the bridge kibitzer who stands behind each of
the players in turn. However, if the problem can be solved in some reasonable way,
such as the hole cam in televised poker, the audience may find the revelation of secrets
quite appealing, leading to good spectation.
Computer games often do badly on spectation due to hidden information. The
standard setup of each player having his own screen, with information that only he
knows, creates an enormous amount of hidden information. Indeed, there may be no
public information at all, at least not in a systematic way—just hidden information
that both people happen to have at a given moment (such as the progress of a specific
battle in an RTS while both players are watching it). However, arcade games or splitscreen console games avoid the hidden-information problem, and of course singleplayer games (whatever other spectation problems they may have, such as lack of
drama) avoid it as well.
Improving Spectation
To make a game’s spectation better, the most basic thing to do is make the game better
in general. Most things (but by no means all, e.g., adding hidden information) that

Superstructure

225

would make the game more enjoyable to play would make it more enjoyable to watch.
Special emphasis should be placed on heuristics, especially beginner heuristics (since
watchers typically have lower levels of skill than players). Good, and very simple,
positional heuristics make it easier for viewers to understand the state the game is in,
which is especially important since the viewers are typically paying less attention than
the players and may even be absent for a time. Good directional heuristics let viewers
say “I would have done that differently!” and thus become more involved in the game.
Removing specific impediments can help. It’s important to limit the knowledge
burden for the viewer: either systemically, by keeping the basics of the game simple
(which goes back to beginner heuristics), or agentially, by presenting the game to
viewers with helpful commentary or summary lines of key information. Another
important point is visual: making sure that hidden information is revealed where
appropriate, that player choices are clearly visible in results within the game, and that
important game events visible to the players are made visible to the spectators as well.
In addition to designing games with spectation in mind, a game can be designed
specifically for spectation—Roman gladiatorial combat and TV game shows spring to
mind—or modified after the fact for better spectation. Sports appear once again as
examples in this latter case: modifications like the shot clock in basketball, tiebreakers
in soccer and tennis, and the instant replay rules in football are all designed in greater
or lesser part to improve spectation. An older and more extreme example of adaptation to spectation comes from Tokugawa Japan: the annual go games played before
the shogun were eventually played out entirely in advance, the players sequestered to
prevent knowledge of the results from leaking out, and then the games replayed before
the shogun, all to prevent the games from lasting too long for the spectators.24 The
shining modern example is the use of instant replay in football. The rule change
occurred not mainly because of the increased accuracy of calls, but far more importantly so the game watched more closely equaled the game officiated.
Exercise 7.15: Choose a game and describe its spectation. What could be done to
improve it? Would it be worth it, or would it be a net loss for the game as a whole?
Exercise 7.16: Consider computer games. Break them up by genre (or according to
some other grouping that seems helpful). Which categories have good spectation?
Which don’t?
Exercise 7.17: How did lax rules on steroid testing and punishment help the spectation of baseball? How did they hurt it—or did they?

poker?

Characteristic: Game Customization

We have mostly been thinking of players as choosing a game that meets their needs,
or even adapting themselves to the needs of the game. Often, however, players adapt
a game to their own needs, by customizing that game in some way. On the narrow
end, this can be the very mild customization of choosing to emphasize one part of
the game over another, as when a chess player memorizes only very aggressive openings and always opts for an attacking style of play. On the broad end, sometimes the
entire game is built around player customization, as with trading card games or role-

Figure 7.7

Superstructure

227

playing games. When the scope for customization is very great, the original game may
feel more like a family of games than like a single game, with each customization
representing a different member of that family.
Sometimes the players are customizing the game as a whole—for example, when
a group decides to play Monopoly with money going to whoever lands on Free Parking.
Sometimes each player customizes his own play—the aforementioned aggressive chess
player, or a person making his own character in World of Warcraft. In the former case,
the customizers are taking on (perhaps unconsciously) the role of game balancers, by
choosing a modification that they feel makes for a fun game. In the latter case,
though, each customizer is trying to make a choice that will benefit herself in some
way (often, though not exclusively, by making her win more often), so game balance
gets quite tricky. It is very hard to make a system that allows players to make all kinds
of individual choices but still ensures that all possible choices are balanced in the
end.25
The customization may take place outside the game, in a preparatory period (building a Magic deck, deciding on a house rule). Or it may take place during the game
(building all air units in Starcraft, getting as much +Strength gear as possible in WoW).
We’ll break game customization into three rough categories:
Personal style Favorite chess openings, or always rushing in Starcraft
House rules Playing by some variant set of rules
• Built-in customization Where the game allows individual players to choose specific
rules or game pieces for themselves, as in Magic or World of Warcraft
•
•

Afterward, we’ll also discuss one particular type of rule variant: handicap systems.
Personal Style
Almost any reasonably complex game allows players to develop some kind of personal
style. In chess a player might be more or less aggressive; in go a player might choose
to emphasize territory or power. In either game a player might choose to memorize
some openings rather than others. More explicit choices might be built into the game:
an FPS might allow a player to be a medic, sniper, or heavy weapons specialist; an RTS
might allow choices of different races, and surely will allow choices of different units.
If a player makes only light use of these kinds of options—perhaps attacking aggressively when he sees an opening, but playing a very positional game otherwise—it may
not be clear where personal style ends and simply trying to play well begins. With
heavy use—say the player always plays a medic no matter what—it starts to look like
the kind of built-in customization an RPG might have.
25. In practice, for highly complex systems, it is essentially impossible. But often, enough of the
options can be balanced for the game to still work.

228

Chapter 7

House Rules
Another common customization option is for players to play some variant of the game
given to them, whether for variety’s sake or as a way of fixing perceived flaws. Sometimes the variants are given within the game (as optional rules or alternate scenarios).
But sometimes the players simply make them up. The Monopoly variant where players
get money for landing on Free Parking is perhaps the most famous example—this
variant is so common many players don’t realize it is not an official rule.
Some games are meant to be modified: informal games such as “playing house” or
(fictionally) Calvinball, or more structured games such as Eleusis, Icehouse, Fluxx, or
dealer’s choice poker.
If the variants are different enough, the new “homebrew” is essentially a new
game built from the parts of the old game. Paper RPGs tend to attract this kind of
attention. More recently, computer games are often built with an open architecture
allowing fans to build all kinds of mods, from minor tweaks to so-called total conversions. These mods may look somewhat like the original game, or they may look wildly

different: a new Quake level might be quite similar to other levels, Counterstrike is
fairly different from Half-Life, and Defense of the Ancients is wildly different from
Warcraft III.
Some game structures are so much of a whole that it is difficult to modify them.
For example, it is hard to see how to change a game like go without just having a
completely different game. Chess, on the other hand, has a basic structure (move your
pieces to checkmate the opposing king) plus many pieces with different characteristics,
lending itself to countless modifications: just create new pieces!
Built-in Customization
Some games have built in the opportunity for players to customize their own individual experiences. This can be thought of as a form of personal style, but much more
than that. Allowing players to customize at this level can lead to a very strong attachment to “my character” or “my deck,” but at the price of greater complexity and more
difficulty in game balance.
Basic customization would include a choice of character type in an FPS, a race in
an RTS, or the different player abilities in Cosmic Encounter. More serious customization
tends to be found in RPGs (paper or online), trading card games, and miniatures
games. However, the concept has been experimented with in many other genres—for
example, in the RTS Impossible Creatures players bring to each game their own army
design, created in advance of the game much like a Magic deck.
Games with heavy player customization are much harder to design and balance.
As mentioned before, letting every player have some of the power of the game
designer, but with personal goals rather than game-level goals, puts enormous pressures on balance. Also, players are likely to expect a stream of new content, to keep
the game fresh, in a way they would not with a less customizable game such as a
standard boardgame.
The player skills involved in customizing a game are often quite different from the
ones involved in playing the game, and players may choose to specialize: some players
may become quite good at building decks or characters, and others might choose to
simply use those builds rather than make their own. Occasionally this state of affairs
can become discouraging for players who would like to make their own custom game
experience, but are intimidated by all the expert templates running around. To help
protect such players a bit, it is often a good idea to balance choices based on templates
people will want to play (for flavor reasons, say) so that they are within striking distance of choices built purely for power.
Games that allow a lot of player customization also tend to have a lot of
scope for personal style and house rules—D&D and Magic both have lots of game
variants and different play styles. Even when the technology does not seem to allow
house rules, as with an MMO that does not allow modding (player modifications to

230

Chapter 7

a game), house rules nevertheless may crop up: that, after all, is what guild rules (such
as DKP26) are.
These types of games have structures that allow a rich metagame experience to
develop around the player desire for creativity and personal expression. It is easy to
be aggressive in a game that gives you explicit choices to do so as a standard variant
in your play. The rewards of self-expression present in-game tend to be magnified in
the metagame. Players can buy and paint miniatures representing their characters,
post blogs about their RPG adventures, or publish their favorite TCG decks to fan
websites.
Handicaps
Handicaps are a kind of rule variant, but one deserving of separate discussion. They
may be made up by players on the spot, or there may be an official handicap system
as part of the formal rules of the game or metagame. The goal is almost always to take
an uneven player matchup and make it more even, so that the outcome is not a foregone conclusion. Examples include golf and go.
Since the purpose of the handicap is to give both players a chance to win, games
with a lot of luck don’t need a handicap system as much. Handicaps are usually found
in low-luck games.
Even if a game could use a handicap system, it is not always easy to give it one. If
the game has some uniform resource, you can give a player more or less of it without
