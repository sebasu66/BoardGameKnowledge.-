shuffling and dealing, or setting up the pieces on the board. Rounding the bases after
hitting a home run is busywork, but most people would say they enjoyed doing it,
and it provides nice pacing and underlining for a big game event. But busywork by
definition does not feel like the core activity of playing the game, it doesn’t involve
any decisions or skills, and it cannot be done better or worse (as far as the player can
see).20 Too much busywork will usually be seen as an annoyance.
Usually when we use the term busywork, we mean that there is enough of it for a
player to notice (perhaps negatively). Strictly speaking the act of rolling the dice and
moving one’s piece around a (nonbranching) track is busywork, but it is rarely seen
as onerous.
Types of Busywork
Busywork can be divided into three basic types, the third of which is only barely
busywork (or arguably not busywork at all, although it may be perceived by the players
as such):
20. An interesting borderline case is painting miniatures in a game like Warhammer. For many
players, this is a core part of the game (or, more properly, the metagame)—both enjoyable and
significant. For some, though, it’s an annoying thing one is sometimes forced to do in order to
play (either because other players demand it or tournament entry requires it). One might think
that painting doesn’t affect the game directly, and can’t be done well or badly from the point of
game victory, thus pushing it toward busywork. But some tournament rules do allow painting
to have an impact, at which point perhaps painting is better viewed as a subgame.

Player Effort

1. “Pure” busywork Completely mechanical operations that must be performed
according to some deterministic algorithm. No choices of any kind are involved. Shuffling and dealing, setting up the board, making change, or looking up results in a
table.
2. Incomprehensible busywork Actions that involve gameplay choices that are completely opaque to the players and are made essentially randomly. Logically these are
quite different from pure busywork, but the effect on the player is much the same.
These are actions that must be performed for the game to continue, but that don’t
involve any meaningful choices and cannot be done better or worse,21 and hence seem
like work unrelated to the play of the game.
3. Very low reward/effort ratio activities Not strictly speaking busywork, these sorts of
activities might seem close to busywork to some players.
Note that incomprehensible busywork is particularly agential, and depends very much
on the heuristics of that particular player (players will, however, often agree as to what
constitutes “pure” busywork). For a beginner, some choice may seem quite arbitrary,
and thus amount to busywork, even though the choice might be meaningful to an
expert player. To a very expert player, the choice might seem logically determined,
and thus busywork again. Some examples:
Dots & Boxes Initial choices seem completely arbitrary to all but an extremely expert
player (see the discussion in section 1.3), so the opening phase of the game has a
busywork feel. To an expert player, the late phase of the game is deterministic, hence
is busywork (although it can simply be skipped and the score counted).
• Chess
The opening seems somewhat arbitrary to the beginner, but probably not
enough to qualify as busywork. To a more advanced player, though, if a standard
opening line is chosen, making the moves in that line is simply playing through the
opening and could be considered busywork.
• Go
A beginner is often so at sea in the opening moves that they may seem like
busywork. A strong player might find it to be busywork to play through a known
opening, but choosing which opening to use in which corner22 based on the situation
elsewhere on the board is definitely not busywork. A really expert player might be
•

21. Note that simply saying “involves no (meaningful) choices” is not enough, since running
quickly in a footrace may not involve any choices, but it is certainly not busywork—it’s what
the race is all about.
22. Opening patterns in go are typically patterns played out in a given corner rather than wholeboard openings as in chess. In fact, there are two words for “opening” in go, one meaning the
corner openings (for which there exist dictionaries like the opening dictionaries in chess) and
the other meaning whole-board opening strategy (for which books also exist, but focused more
on general strategic principles than on specific fixed sequences of moves).

essentially rederiving and modifying an opening sequence as he goes, thus making
the play of even a standard opening no longer busywork.
• Nim
If you don’t know how to play, the majority of the game is all incomprehensible busywork. Once you do, it’s deterministic, and thus busywork again (or simply
not a game at all).
Exercise 6.12: Briefly discuss three to five other games in terms of busywork. Some
possibilities:
Tic-tac-toe
A European boardgame
A highly complex computer game
A sport
A game of your choice
In the extreme, the general pattern that occurs is something along the lines of
(incomprehensible) busywork becomes interesting play becomes (pure/deterministic)
busywork. The first and last phases are obviously unfortunate. Avoiding the first is a
matter of having good beginner heuristics; avoiding the last is a matter of having good
expert heuristics.23
Busywork and Game Evolution over Time
In general, games (and game genres) tend to evolve over time to reduce busywork.
Some noteworthy examples:
Backgammon Originally one began with the pieces off the board and had to bear
them on (move them on as part of game play). Later, the pieces started on the board,
and later still they started on the board with the opposing pieces interspersed in an
immediately interesting position (as they are today). The addition of the doubling
cube early in the twentieth century, although it did many things for the game, can
partially be thought of as reducing the busywork of finishing an almost certainly won
game (see also section 2.1 on player elimination). In each case, the game underwent
an increase in popularity.24
• Chess
Increased movement of the pawns, castling, and more powerful pieces like
the queen all reduced the “busywork” of early forms of chess where the opening moves
consisted of a great deal of pawn pushing. (Other forms of chess solved this problem
•

23. Again, “good” in the sense of “good for the game,” not “strong/powerful” or “good for the
player who uses them.” In this case, the designer wants the beginner heuristics to be strong
enough to provide at least some guidance, and the expert heuristics not to be so strong as to be
deterministic.

Book.

in other ways, with Chinese chess opening its pawn structure and Japanese chess
allowing players to use captured pieces as paratroopers.)
• MMOs
An increase of questing over grinding and a general increase in the
ease of leveling are part of what made World of Warcraft so popular, producing features likely to dominate the genre. Moving around the virtual world is also a form
of busywork or downtime, and newer MMOs (or even later versions of the same
MMO) tend to have more ways of moving around quickly (teleporting, various
mounts).
• RTS games The initial build patterns (once they are discovered by the players) are
often seen as “busywork.” Later RTS games seem more likely to have various ways
around them: starting with some basic buildings and units in play, automated worker
management, or no workers at all. Build queues, rally points, and hotkeys can all be
thought of as ways to reduce busywork.
The trend toward decreasing busywork is by no means absolute and one-directional,
however. To take one interesting example, consider inventory management in computer RPGs. Before the advent of graphical RPGs, one’s inventory was a simple list,
and managing it involved relatively little busywork. Once graphical interfaces became
common, the typical interface was a large box showing what one could carry, and
individual items took up more or less space, introducing the busywork of arranging
one’s items in order to use the space efficiently. Arguably the new interface made
designers reimagine things from scratch, and since the evolution from more to less
busywork is often unconscious, they did not realize the costs of the new way of managing inventory—or perhaps they were seduced by the lure of greater “realism.” In
any case, over time the graphical interfaces had less busywork, first with the addition
of buttons that autoarranged one’s inventory, and later with the simple expedient of
making every item take up one inventory slot, regardless of how big it “really” was.
Additional inventory space (especially in banks), easier mailing to one’s “mule” characters, and increasing stacking of items all pushed toward reducing the strains of
inventory management. Ironically, though, these very things that make inventory
management easier also encourage people to keep larger and larger inventories, worsening the problem again—whether the end result is a net decrease in inventory busywork is anyone’s guess.
On average, busywork seems relatively low in sports and classic boardgames and
card games, somewhat higher in newer boardgames and card games, and highest of
all in computer games.25 This is, perhaps, further evidence of a tendency for busywork
to be evolved out over time—the older the genre is, the less busywork it has.
25. Interestingly, although computer game players are relatively tolerant of busywork, they are
highly intolerant of downtime.

Chapter 6

Ways of Controlling Busywork
In general, there are many methods of reducing or eliminating busywork depending
on the details of the busywork in question. Some have been mentioned above, such
as converting a large amount of marginal busywork into a small amount of pure
busywork in the case of backgammon setup, or automating certain busywork processes
in computer games in the case of the inventory autoarrangement button.
Sometimes busywork can be reduced by assigning it to a third party. This is especially common in sports, where referees do a certain amount of busywork (like moving
chains in football) in addition to their primary duties. A more straightforward example
is that of the ball boy or ball girl in tennis. Examples in the worlds of paper and
computer gaming are rarer, but they do exist: Chinese gold farmers in an MMO are
one. In general, if large-scale farming out of busywork makes a big difference in how
players enjoy the game, it may be a sign the game design needs further attention to
ways of eliminating that busywork.
If busywork is farmed out to a third party, it often means that the player who would
have had the busywork now has downtime instead. Less commonly, busywork can
become downtime when marginal busywork is converted into pure busywork, which
is then done by another player: the bridge dummy being the classic example.26
Exercise 6.13: Choose a game that has all three types of busywork, and explain how
it has each type. Are there activities in the game that some players see as busywork
and that others do not?
Exercise 6.14: How does the player elimination common in many games (e.g.,
Monopoly) affect busywork?
Exercise 6.15: Is traveling in an MMO busywork—is it busywork to walk from place
to place? The first time? The tenth time? The thousandth time? How might an MMO
deal with these changes over time in busywork?
Exercise 6.16: Is “grinding” for experience in an RPG busywork? How might an
RPG deal with these changes over time in the busywork associated with a repetitive
task?
Exercise 6.17: Would you expect beginners or experts in chess to resign earlier?
Why?
Exercise 6.18: Why might computer games have relatively more busywork but relatively less downtime compared to other kinds of games?
26. It is arguable whether dummy’s play (if required to be performed in the normal fashion)
would really be boring enough to qualify as busywork, but it would almost certainly be less
interesting than the play of any of the other three hands. So, since someone needs to go get
more drinks, declarer’s partner seems like the best choice.

Player Effort

189

Characteristic: Reward/Effort Ratio

Things that players do in an attempt to win a game will typically require some
amount of effort, either during the game (e.g., counting cards played in bridge) or in
preparation (practicing your basketball foul shots again and again). That effort may
be mental or physical. Any given effort will yield some amount of reward. Players
will tend to prefer doing things that give a high amount of reward for a small amount
of effort.
Choosing to engage in a certain effort is executing a heuristic (“in thus-and-such
a situation, do this activity”) but the effort itself may not be: it may be a calculation
(counting cards), a purely physical activity (running as fast as possible, or throwing a
ball through a hoop), or some other kind of activity (grinding in an MMO).
We wish to examine the relationship between the amount and kinds of effort
players exert, and the reward they get for that effort. In general, the reward we’re
focused on here is that of doing well at the game (and whatever other rewards, such
as prestige or money, might stem from that), but of course players can make greater
or lesser efforts directed at any of the rewards a game might have to offer.
Sometimes the ratio of reward to effort is low enough that the players don’t wish
to do the effort, and they will say things like “it’s just too much work.” Of course, the
most competitive players will seek every advantage they can, but depending on where
they fall on the casual-to-competitive scale, some efforts that players may reject
include
•
•
•
•
•
•

Counting cards played in trick-taking games
Memorizing openings in chess
Diving for the ball on a muddy field
Extensive physical drill in team sports
General physical conditioning
More generally, any outside of game training (“I just want to play”)

Many games will or won’t work for a certain audience based on their perceptions
of the reward/effort ratio for the common activities in the game. At a very general
level, people who find physical things easy and are good at them will enjoy being
rewarded with victory in physical games, and will be more likely to play them, while
their more cerebral and less athletic counterparts may prefer boardgames over sports.
But even among boardgame players, many will avoid games like chess because activities like memorizing openings or reading out complex lines of play seem more like
work than like fun.
The reward/effort ratio is of course agential in that how much work is too much is
a player perception. But it is agential in another perhaps more interesting way: different playgroups will have their own ideas about which heuristics are worth the effort,

Player Effort

191

which will affect a new player joining the group. If the group is very casual and feels
counting cards (or diving for the ball) is not really worth it, a new player who wants
a relaxed game will be content. If the group counts cards on a regular basis, the new
player may feel obligated to do the same. Even if he does not, he may suffer increased
downtime from the players who do, decreased chances of winning, and a generally
less relaxed atmosphere. The group is pushing him toward an escalated level of play
that is less enjoyable than the more casual experience would be. If the new player is
instead more serious than the group, she may be encouraged to “relax” or “take it
easy” as the group tries to preserve the style of play they enjoy and to avoid having
to engage in what they see as unpleasant activities just to stay at the same level of
winning.
Calculations
One type of effort common in many nonphysical games is calculating. We use the
term here broadly, to mean mental efforts that are particularly formulaic, efforts where
having a computer or even just paper and pencil would be a help. Examples include
Counting cards or memorizing other game data
Playing a memorized opening in chess27
• Reading out a series of moves (“if she goes there, and then I go there, and then she
goes there, then I go there, and then she takes my rook”)
• Actual calculations in the mathematical sense (e.g., calculating the odds in poker or
blackjack)
•
•

Calculations tend to be particularly unappealing to players. Fortunately they usually
have decreasing returns to scale. In hearts, for example, there are a number of things
a player might keep track of, such as
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.

Has the queen of spades been played?
Have the ace and king of spades been played?
How many spades have been played?
Is someone out of a suit?
Which key cards are outstanding in some particular suit I care about?
Who has taken a heart?
Have any cards I’ve passed been played?
How many cards of each suit have been played?
Exactly which honors have been played?

27. Note that calling this a “calculation” is overloading the English definition of the term, but
it makes sense to include these sorts of activities in our discussion at this point. Strictly speaking,
perhaps it is better to think of executing the opening as busywork and the “calculation” as the
memorization work involved in learning it.

192

Chapter 6

10. Exactly which of the lowest cards (say 2–4) have been played?
11. Exactly which cards have been played?
12. Exactly which cards have been played, when, and by whom?
Only the last step means the player has all the information he could possibly need,
and few players would go that far. Keeping track of just the queen of spades gives a
big payoff. Keeping track of the high spades, or the numbers of cards played in various
suits, or who is out of each suit, all give a good payoff. Keeping track of every single
card played and who played which one when—immensely more effort—gives only a
modest payoff beyond that. Games where each additional effort in calculation gives
a smaller marginal return will give experts something to do, but those more advanced
calculations won’t be absolutely required for beginners to keep up.
Returns to Effort
If we graph the reward a player receives for a given amount of effort (whether
from calculation, from study and preparation, or from some other source),
decreasing returns to effort would mean we would expect a graph something like the
one in figure 6.6.
Learning the first or the second technique gives a lot of reward for relatively little
effort. Learning the third or the fourth technique gives somewhat less reward, and
so on.
Graphs of this sort are very rough, and are meant only to provide a guide to one’s
intuition. Effort should be taken to include both effort spent in game and effort spent

out of game (say by memorizing strategies, studying books, doing practice drills, or
working out in the gym). Reward here represents an increased chance for the player
to win, as compared with a player of his own level.28 At the level of abstraction we
are using, the graphs may equally well be thought of as graphs of returns to skill (see
section 5.2).
For another example, think of chess. There are great returns to being able to read
out sequences of moves. These advantages are enormous if you compare being able
to look ahead a move or two versus not looking ahead at all. But the difference
between looking ahead four moves and looking ahead five or six is perhaps not so
great. And given that looking ahead five or six moves is vastly more difficult, the gain
per unit of effort in looking ahead five or six moves instead of four is very small indeed
when compared to what you gained looking ahead one or two moves (although still
large enough, perhaps, to matter in a game like chess without overt random elements
that decrease payoffs to skill).
In fact, it is quite natural that effort should have decreasing returns to scale in
general. Players, as they attempt to improve their skills, will tend to look for the way
to gain the greatest improvement with the least amount of time and effort. So if two
different calculations are possible, each involving the same amount of effort, the
player will naturally choose first to make the one that has the biggest payoff. Thus,
because of the order in which players choose to learn their skills, there will naturally
28. In other words, one can think of rewards as being measured in Elo points.

194

Chapter 6

Reward/Effort Ratio and Randomness
As discussed in section 5.2, the payoff to skill goes down in the presence of randomness:
a given amount of skill (or effort spent to acquire skill) will not yield as high a winning
percentage in a game with a lot of randomness. Figure 6.8 shows chess and hearts, but
the diagram comparing chess and die-rolling chess would have essentially the same form.
One can look at the ability of beginners to play with experts in games with randomness
using these diagrams. Let’s pull apart the two curves above for chess and hearts. Imagine
a game like hearts, poker, or Monopoly with large amounts of randomness. There, the
returns to effort are modest, so an expert gains only a limited improvement in chance to
win over a beginner (figure 6.9).
However, for a game like chess or go, the additional effort put in to become an expert
yields a very large payoff in increased winning chances. This larger spread means beginners
and experts are too far apart to play together (if one wishes for both to have a reasonable
chance to win) (figure 6.10).
Although it’s a natural impulse to want effort to be rewarded as richly as possible, the
game designer needs to be cautious: Who is her intended audience? How will her players
be finding opponents? Will all the players who want to play be able to have a good
experience?

be decreasing returns to effort in most cases.29 This may not hold, though, if logic
dictates that certain skills need to be learned before certain others—see the discussion
below on the need to learn basic techniques in sports.
In general, additional rewards to calculation decrease with effort. Sometimes,
though, games may have calculations where the rewards increase as you go up the
difficulty scale. Such games severely punish beginners. Increasing returns to calculation may happen when reading out a series of moves, where the returns to being able
to read out to the end of a sequence, or to be able to read just a little bit further than
one’s opponent, can be quite large.30 This sets up a sort of arms race where players
feel they have to be very good at calculating to be able to play, and that will drive out
many players (again, think of chess or go). That said, certain people are definitely
attracted to games with no overt luck and no hidden information, and in such games
reading out the game tree will always be an important element. In general, though,
games with lots of calculation for a big reward are at a disadvantage, since most players
don’t like calculating.
Aside from the reading out of moves, another place where calculations can be
powerful occurs toward the end of many boardgames with a point-based victory condition. Early on, rough estimates are a reasonable guide to play, and these estimates
can be heuristic-based. Toward the end, one can see exactly how far other players are
based on the score, calculate exactly how each possible play will modify that score,
and choose one’s plays accordingly. One sees this problem in go and in many European
boardgames.31
Heuristics can to some extent limit the need for calculation. Any chess heuristic is
an example—with perfect calculation, chess heuristics would be irrelevant because one
could simply follow the game tree. Or, in hearts, the heuristic “play the highest nonwinning card” offsets a good deal of calculation and memorization. Good heuristics
can move a game from “lots of calculation gives a big payoff” to a state where lots of
calculation gives a diminishing payoff.
29. For the mathematically inclined, if R gives reward as a function of effort, then because further
effort generally gives further reward, we expect R′ > 0. Since in general the size of that reward
will decrease, we expect R′′ < 0. In other words, R is typically rising but concave down.
30. For example—admittedly an extreme case—in tic-tac-toe or Nim, a player who can execute
exactly the perfect strategy has an enormous advantage over a player whose ability falls just short
of that. More realistically, being able to read to the end of a life-and-death problem in go is very
useful, but being able to read four-fifths of the way through it is of relatively little use.
31. Really this is just a special case of reading out the game tree. In go, it’s probably fine, since
the game is heavily reading-based anyway. In European boardgames, it leads to an endgame that
may not be appealing to the sort of audience that most of the gameplay appeals to. For one
possible solution, see the last section in this chapter.

Chess reconsidered—rewards for opening study

All other things being equal, players will enjoy a steep reward-for-effort curve.
That is, they will like it if it is readily apparent that extra effort is yielding strong
results. In the abstract, this is true for both casual and competitive players—a highly
competitive player focused on a game’s rewards will appreciate the extra effort being
a clear differentiator. The problem is that while steep curves in isolation are enjoyable, so is winning. Thus games are saddled with the problem that steep curves
are not casual-friendly. Single-player games break this unfortunate situation with a
player pool that is matched to the effort of a casual player and that doesn’t care
about its win percentage—namely computer AIs. Thus casual single-player games can
have very steep reward-for-effort curves that multiplayer casual games in general
cannot.
Further Examples of Reward for Effort
Although returns to effort typically get smaller and smaller for the reasons discussed
above, there can be exceptions. For example, one arguably gets a relatively large bump
up in chess skill when one begins studying openings. Occasionally this phenomenon
causes problems in playgroups, when some people in the group embark on this study
and others do not, with the end result that people cannot continue to play together
satisfactorily.32
32. Of course, this separation of player skill more often happens simply because some people
just start putting in a lot more effort than others.

Begin to learn new swing

Effort
Figure 6.12
Tiger’s new swing

In general, effort in a game improves performance, or why would players make the
effort? But occasionally a player may make an effort that sacrifices short-term performance in the hope of a long-term gain. Fundamental technique adjustment in games
requiring physical skill can fall into this category. For example, if a skilled golf pro
like Tiger Woods changes his swing, he very well may be worse for a while until the
new swing is perfected. At a less advanced level, any beginning console fighting game
player may find that, when first transitioning from simple button mashing to deliberately trying to perform combos, there is a temporary decrease in performance. Other
techniques that might at first make a player worse include starting to learn openings
in go (unlike chess, it’s possible to choose the “wrong opening” in a given situation),
memorizing almost all the cards in hearts, or learning a new race in an RTS game.
Of course, when a player tries a new technique, she cannot know for certain if it
will improve her situation. Perhaps the new technique is worse than the old one! (See
figure 6.13.) Some games, simple slot machines for example, do not reward effort, or,
if you like, there is simply no effort to be made (figure 6.14). Progressive slots, it turns
out, can offer very slight rewards after a great deal of study. Of course, if those rewards
take you from 49 percent against the house to 51 percent, they can be quite exciting
to some (figure 6.15).
Another exception to the general rule of decreasing rewards per unit effort can
occur in games where there is a big startup cost. This is especially common in sports.
If you are learning tennis, snowboarding, or bicycle riding, you spend a lot of effort
in the beginning for essentially no reward at all—you can hardly do the activity at all

yet! But none of the more rewarding intermediate techniques can be learned before
you learn the basics, so you must spend the time and effort on these low-reward
activities first (figure 6.16).
Note that it is not hard to learn twenty new boardgames a year, but hardly anyone
learns twenty new sports a year. This upfront cost is why.
Controlling Low Reward/Effort Ratios
Particularly frustrating for players are game activities that they see as having low
reward/effort ratios, but that they feel they must perform anyway to be good players.
Calculations, like counting cards or memorizing chess openings, often fall into this
category. If one is designing or modifying a game, there are various ways to deal with
this problem.
The simplest in principle is to eliminate the activity entirely. One might wish for
this solution, say, with grinding in an MMO. But replacing all the grinding content
with some more interesting way to level would require either an MMO game design
breakthrough or a much larger budget for content generation (more quests, more boss
fights, more zones, and so on), and so many MMOs have at least some amount of
grinding in them.
Occasionally one might want simply to increase the reward. If the effort is not
unpleasant, but does not seem to provide enough return, making the reward worth
the effort might be all that is needed. Beware of this method when the effort is intrinsically unenjoyable, though: if grinding in an MMO is not fun, giving it greater XP

Sports—some rewards come slowly at first

rewards does not fix the problem. It just makes it worse. The underlying principle is
that the most fun way to play a game, and the way that is “best” in the sense of
helping you win the most, should be the same. If playing in a boring or unpleasant
fashion is the best way to advance in a game, that game will become unenjoyable for
many players. Some players may be able to ignore the efficient but boring playstyle
and just play to have fun, but others will feel the pressure to “play correctly” and then
eventually quit the entire game in disgust.
One can look at the effort involved and find some way to decrease it. One example
is in card games where the discard pile may be freely examined: such a rule means
that memorization of cards played is less necessary. Now any decision based on
knowing what cards have been played requires less effort. However, this lessening of
effort may have the unfortunate side effect of slowing the game down as players look
at the discard pile frequently. The game designer has to balance the positives and
negatives of that decision.
Oddly enough, the dangers of decreasing the effort or increasing the reward suggest
another way to improve the situation: increase the effort, or decrease the reward, to
the point where very few people will engage in the activity. For example, in some
European boardgames where players need a certain amount of gold (or some other
game resource) to win, the amount that each player has is kept secret from other
players. This prevents the unenjoyable activity of players counting everyone’s gold
before taking any important action near the end of the game. Of course, players could
try to memorize how much gold each player has earned during the course of the game.

Chapter 6

This problem is sometimes addressed by having some money be earned secretly (e.g.,
by being written on a card that a player earns during the game without ever showing
it to other players),33 thus decreasing the reward for the activity of memorization. If
done properly, tweaks like this can take unpleasant activities—that is, ones with a low
reward/effort ratio—and largely eliminate them from the game. If done improperly,
they can take unpleasant activities and make them even more unpleasant. Which
result you get depends as much on the audience for your game (at what point do they
decide to just not engage in the activity?) as on the tweaks themselves.
Further examples of decreasing returns from calculation include the randomness
of die rolls in miniatures games (without the die rolls, such games might have the
same rewards from calculation that chess does) or random damage in an RTS (without
it, memorizing exact break points on damage and hit point upgrades would become
a much greater memory burden). A reverse example is the dummy in bridge: here, the
revealing of dummy’s hand increases the rewards from calculation in the exact play
of the hand. In general, randomness and hidden information tend to decrease calculation rewards.
Sometimes the heuristic or activity can be disguised with randomness. This has the
effect of decreasing the rewards, and probably increasing the effort of discovering the
heuristic as well, both of which will mean that players will feel it less necessary to
engage in it.
Exercise 6.19: Why would someone find their overall reward/effort ratio decreased
when learning a new golf swing?
Exercise 6.20: What would you expect of the player audience for games with a (low)
horizontal asymptote34 in a reward/effort graph? Why? Can you give examples of such
games?
Exercise 6.21: What would you expect to happen to the chess player audience at the
point where the study of openings begins (i.e., how many chess players are there who
inhabit the points just before and just after that point on the reward/effort graph)?
Exercise 6.22: How might the reward/effort graph of Magic have changed over time?
For example, how might the graph have looked on release compared to how it looks
now?
33. Note that this also relies on randomness: if the amount of money on the hidden card is
completely predictable, it can hardly be secret.
34. An asymptote is a line in a graph to which the graph gets closer and closer without ever
quite reaching it.

A great deal of what matters in a game takes place outside of or alongside the gameplay
proper. There may be preparation before the game, crowds of people watching it,
stories told about it, modifications made to it, or behavior that goes against the official
or accepted practices of the game. In this chapter, we discuss various phenomena that
might be thought of as somehow “outside” the game. This is in no way meant to be
a value judgment, but merely a way of grouping content—many of these phenomena
are just as important, if not more so, than the ones “internal” to the game.
We begin with a general discussion of the metagame: all those activities relating to
the game that aren’t part of the play of the game itself, such as preparation for the
game. We then talk about game conceits: themes that give the game cohesion and
identity, even if they aren’t included in the rules directly. Sometimes these themes are
story-based, especially in computer games, but very often they are not. We follow with
a discussion of ways players can customize games, and then we look at ways players
may violate expectations: whether by actually breaking the rules, or by breaking norms
of “acceptable” behavior. Finally, we examine some factors that influence how long a
player wants to keep playing the same game—does the game seem infinitely replayable, or does it at some point “run out” of content?

Characteristic: Metagame

The metagame is the “game outside the game.” It includes all the activities connected
with the game that aren’t part of playing the game itself, such as tournament programs, online forums, magazines about the game, training and preparation players
might do before the game, or even daydreaming about the game or staring lovingly
at game equipment. If the game is the skeleton, the metagame is the “soft” structure
outside the game, linking the game with other life goals such as status, self-expression,
gaining mastery, money, socialization, or collecting. Many of the rewards for gaming
come in whole or in part from the metagame, not the game itself.

The term metagame isn’t that common outside of hardcore gaming circles and is
almost never used, for example, when discussing sports. So typically people will use
the term game to discuss both the game proper and the metagame. But we will generally try to distinguish the two: if you are on the field trying to score a goal during a
game, you’re taking part in the game of soccer; if you are practicing penalty kicks, or
you are buying cleats, you are taking part in the metagame of soccer.
Hardcore gamers often use the word metagame in a narrower sense. If a game allows
very specific preparation before the match, like building a deck in a trading card game,
the “metagame” is the current environment resulting from all these preparations (e.g.,
perhaps people are playing a lot of fast red decks at the moment, and not many people
are playing slow blue ones). With this usage, “metagaming” is game preparation done
to prepare for the current environment (perhaps you’ll choose to put anti-red cards
in your deck, or cards that will slow down a fast deck).1 We won’t use the word
metagame in this more narrow sense.
1. Note that special preparations because of a specific game environment, although especially
common in games such as trading card games, exist in many other games as well. One might
study specific chess openings to prepare for a certain opponent, or field a slightly different starting football team when the weather is very bad.

The (broader) metagame is an extremely complicated subject, but an important one
for a game designer or game critic. A great deal of the enjoyment of a game, and thus
of its success or failure, comes from factors outside the game. For example, one can
take a crowd of adults who would not normally enjoy rock-paper-scissors, put a tournament structure around it, and turn it into an entertaining experience.2 Given all
the possible structures that can be added to a metagame, knowing where to put one’s
effort—which structures are worth adding and which give little or no benefit—is
extremely important.
2. One of the authors actually did this experiment at the annual Game Developers Conference
several years ago.

Player Communities
Different players will have different preferred styles of play. The most obvious distinction is casual versus serious, but communities may have preferences around rule variants, formats, times and places to play, and so on. Unless a player is playing a
single-player game in complete isolation,3 she’ll be influenced by some sort of community. One can think of these different communities as forming different game
environments or player microclimates—environments that may vary enough as to be
almost different games. A player may very well be happy in one microclimate but not
enjoy another microclimate at all, for reasons that may be social or conveniencerelated, or that may stem from the style of play the group prefers. Sometimes a player
is unaware that her enjoyment or lack thereof is coming from the microclimate, and
may say “chess is great” or “chess is boring” when really it is the microclimate that
is great or boring, and a different environment might lead to the opposite reaction.
So for a player to enjoy a game, finding the right player community is very important. At the most basic level, it’s finding the right opponents: ones who aren’t too
much stronger or weaker, and whose approach to the game is similar enough to be
congenial. If you play Ultimate Frisbee, say, you will probably want to be with people
who are not too much more or less dexterous than you are. If you don’t care to dive
into the mud to catch the Frisbee, you will not want to be with people who will berate
you for that choice—if you do go all-out, though, you may not want to play with
people who “aren’t trying.”
For games that take place in the physical world, communities are dependent
on physical location. You may not have a wide choice of different Ultimate Frisbee
leagues where you live (indeed, you may not have any). But for popular sports, there
are often multiple leagues, often in a fairly organized way: A leagues and B leagues,
leagues separated by age or gender, leagues where the teams are formed around the
workplace, and so on. For boardgames and card games, the choices aren’t as wide,
and often not as formalized. But enter any game store and look at the postings for
role-playing groups and you will see players trying to sort themselves into the right
microclimates.
Online, there are bulletin boards, guild websites, wikis, and other player communities. But when it comes time to play the game itself, since geography is not a limitation, players are often thrown into one big hopper, and then some kind of player
matching occurs. Perhaps players deliberately select people they already know to play
with; perhaps they look at a list of games and choose to join one. More and more,
though, some sort of algorithm is used to match people, although these algorithms
currently use far fewer kinds of information than players use in offline matching.
3. Note that many single-player games have communities, such as online bulletin boards that
trade strategy tips, or a group of people at the office who are obsessed with Tetris.

When looking at a metagame, one thing to watch out for is how much it fragments
player communities. Many games have deliberately built in choices about how you
play them: different player settings (e.g., game speed, or starting money) when spawning a game in an RTS, different PvP battles available in an MMO, different formats to
play Magic. Each new format choice is appealing, because it lets players customize their
experience that much more, and there is always someone who wishes you could tweak
this or that setting, or play on some new map. But too much of that, and there is the
risk that none of the different formats will succeed: players will not be able to find
the choice they want, or the minimum number of people required to join the game
won’t be available. Smaller game communities—often physical ones—are especially
vulnerable. If twelve players show up at your store to play Magic, you can run a tournament. But if half of them want to play sealed Magic, and half want to play constructed, and you need at least eight people to start a tournament, you may have
nothing. And then next week they won’t come back. So it is important that there be
a balance between having enough options for players to find something they like4 and
having few enough options that players can make a choice and expect to find someone
else to play with. Newer games, games that take place in the physical world, and less
popular games have to be most careful about having too many formats; established
games, online games, and very popular games have more leeway.
Metagame Support for Player Goals
Features of a game and its metagame can support different player goals in a variety of
ways. For example, in an MMO socialization is supported in-game with chat and guild
systems. Apparently simple features like the ability to create a custom chat channel
(and how the channel is moderated, and whether it is persistent through logoff, and
so on) can make a real difference in how well players can socialize. The basic gameplay
structure of an MMO supports socialization as well: there is a lot of downtime, such
as while waiting for a raid to form, and not much to do during it. That downtime has
a real negative side, as lengthy downtime generally does, but the socialization benefits
are large (whether it is a net win is hard to say for certain—it’s almost certainly agen4. Keep in mind that most players will prefer to have their second choice actually happen
than have their first choice on offer but fail to take place. And for some minor format tweaks,
players won’t miss them if they aren’t there—the choice to build all possible variants into a game
under the theory that “it can’t hurt to have it available” and “someone might like it” is generally
misguided. If your RTS has a dozen binary settings, letting your formats be all of the 212 possible
ways of playing is not a good choice. Better to carefully pick three or four choices from the 212
possibilities and have those be your formats. Now your players can figure out which of those
three or four choices they prefer, and they can hope to find a game that matches their
preference.

tial). Out-of-game, there are forums, informational websites (both official and fancreated), guild websites, and so on.
Exercise 7.1: For various sports, give some examples of game features and metagame
features that support socialization.
Exercise 7.2: Pick a game you know with a lot of downtime that players use to socialize. Is the downtime a net benefit or a net loss? Why? Would more downtime be
better? Would less?
Human beings certainly like accumulating stuff, and again there are both in-game and
out-of-game ways to support that. Some games have collecting as part of the gameplay
itself (e.g., the Pokémon handheld games), which is not a metagame feature per se.
Some games (Magic, golf, bicycle racing) have a great variety of equipment available
for players to collect—the equipment is useful in-game, but collecting it is a metagame
activity and, for some people, can become an end in itself.5
Games can have monetary benefits as well: playing for money (poker, backgammon), tournament prizes (many games), professional play. Even the dream of such
rewards can be enticing for many players—certainly far more players are inspired by
the idea of making a living playing basketball than can actually do so. If professional
play is out of reach, players can still make money in the metagame: repairing bikes
for other people, or trading for Magic cards and then selling them on the secondary
market.
Besides money, other prizes may include goods useful in ordinary life, items useful
to play the game, and of course trophies. Although trophies are strictly speaking a
physical good, they are really more about status than wealth. Any prize, though, can
help fulfill a player’s desire for status. Wealth is powerful in this way, since saying you
have won a large sum of money is more convincing to most people as a sign of
achievement than almost any other prize (especially people outside of the game’s
community—many a game player has finally gotten some sort of understanding and
respect from his nonplaying relatives by winning a tournament with a large cash
prize). Ratings, rankings, and titles are another way for players to gain respect, although
of course such achievements are better understood inside the game community than
outside of it. If the game has any kind of media coverage, that will increase status as
well.
5. If that is all those people care about in regard to your game, and they stop playing the game
itself, then you have the odd situation that they are players in your metagame but not players
in your game. One might think of retailers as being in this category, but kids who collect Pokémon
cards but do not play are probably a better example. These people are not necessarily bad for the
game—thinking about ways to convert them into players is probably a good idea, but trying to
chase them off entirely is usually a mistake.

If a player can develop signature moves, a unique play style, or even a notable
personality, that can enhance his status. Poker players and sports figures do this a
great deal, but it is part of almost any gaming community. These sorts of reputational
benefits also provide self-expression, and sometimes gameplay benefits (e.g., intimidation) as well. Distinct player styles can arise out of the richness of the game itself if
there are enough different ways to play (basketball does well here, but sprinting, say,
does not). Sometimes features can be put into the game deliberately to support player
expression and style, as with special titles or visible armor in an MMO.
