generally make things more fun!
You could create a game that is totally dependent on a device or prop to play. You can’t play
Musical Chairs without the titular chairs. Watch Ya’ Mouth (2016) just isn’t the same without
a plastic mouthguard. Wavelength (2019) is useless without its spinner dial; and what would
Don’t Step In It! (2017) be like without the simulated doggie poo made from “molded compound”? On second thought, maybe don’t answer that question. Regardless of what kind of
prop you use, the key is interaction.

The Sixth P Is for Player
Of course, you need players to play a party game. What type of interaction those players have
with each other makes a big difference in how the game plays.
First, players can be organized either as individuals or as teams. There are distinct advantages to both setups. In Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition, Beer Pong, and We’re Doomed, individuals are trying to compete for points or position to win. It gives players a chance to feel smart,
keep a secret or exhibit a talent that might get overlooked when participating as a team.
Teamplay benefits from multiple minds working toward a common goal. Having many players allows knowledge gaps to be filled and fosters cooperation. The game Codenames thrives
from this. However, it can also back­fire! I have seen a group of players determine the correct
answer through group-­think, only to talk themselves out of it minutes later! This causes delicious tension for both the players and the clue-­giver!
Another factor to keep in mind is how players congregate in a room. This can be impacted by
the type of party game they’re playing—­a thinking game or an action game.
Thinking games are much more leisurely and require less interaction between players. Players
can spread out around the room and don’t have to be congregated around a central location.
Action games, on the other hand, benefit from the players being in proximity or even contact
with each other. The type of space your party takes place in can make a big difference in how
a game is played.
Finally, consider the rules of your game. Are they chaotic or lawful? If a mistake happens,
can the players “go back” and re-­adjust or redo, or are they stuck with the consequences of
their actions?
Ultimately, keeping things fun is the most important thing! It’s a party after all!

Party Game Mechanisms
As we’ve seen, party games thrive on interaction, and there are several mechanisms that
designers can use to create that interaction. Let’s review them!

Knowledge
Knowledge is the key to winning and designing any trivia game. Ask a question, and if you
answer it correctly, you score! The trivia found in these games can be broad as in the general

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

topics9 found in Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition or very specific as in Trivial Pursuit: Classic Star
Wars Trilogy Edition (1998). These targeted trivia games can be great fun if you and the other
players are die-­hard fans, but not so much if you don’t know your Ponda Baba’s from your
Mowma Nadon’s.
This genre of party game tends to be popular as they are simple to design; just be sure to
include plenty of cards! I find that you should have a minimum of 300 cards but preferably
closer to 1000. Players also enjoy trivia games as they make the player feel smart. I always say
that a good game makes a player feel smart, powerful, or rich—­preferably all three!
However, if you don’t know the answers, it can get frustrating. This is why people either love
or hate trivia games. These games are also very populous on today’s market, so you’d have to
come up with an original take on a trivia game to get modern publishers interested in making one. But that hasn’t stopped some designers. In fact, there are some games like The Wrong
Game (2006), Best Wrong Answer (2020), and So Wrong It’s Right (2021) where you win by
answering questions incorrectly!
Trivia isn’t the only way to use knowledge for game play. The game Carnelli (2007) has players
creating associations between two words (such as a book, movie, or song title). For example,
you could connect the TV show Star Trek with the book Baby and Child Care. Only by knowing
something about these two titles would you know the connection.10 Six Degrees of Kevin
Bacon (1997) also relies on knowledge of films and their contents to create connections. Even
your knowledge of spelling can be turned into gameplay as in the classic game Hangman
(17th century) and its modern equivalent Hangman (1976) and card games like Quiddler
(1998) and Wordical (2013) and Snippets (2016).

Word Play
Language has been the inspiration for parlor and party games since the 1800s. In Our Granny
Doesn’t Like Tea (circa 1800) you must say alternative foods or drinks for Granny in five
seconds but words that contain the letter T are forbidden. The Minister’s Cat (circa 1800) has
players listing adjectives that start with the same letter, as long as no two players repeat the
same answer.
Classics of the genre persist in today’s market. Scrabble (1948), Boggle (1972), and Scattergoires
(1988) are easily found both in stores and online. Newer word games continue to be made
such as Wordsy (2017), Letter Jam (2019), and Wordle: The Party Game (2020).

Dabble (2011) and On the Grid (2015) have you creating as many words as possible from a
selection of letters. Dictionary also known as Fictionary (1984) and Balderdash (1984) has
players make up definitions for an obscure word, and you must guess the real definition.
While a game like this relies upon knowledge, it also requires some creativity to think of a
convincing and deceptive answer.
Many of the same ideas and mechanisms found in word-­centric party games work for regular
word games. I’ll be talking much more about word games in the next chapter. Stay tuned!

Guessing
While guessing leads to answers, it is a different way to get there than knowledge. Sometimes
the act of circling around an answer by guessing aids the clue giver as the players try to narrow down the answer. I find it fun when guessing becomes a stream of consciousness and
absurdity ensues.11 This is a phenomenon that I have witnessed when playing games such as
Charades, Head’s Up Party Game (2013), and Pictionary. Guessing games lend themselves to
creating a loud and rambunctious atmosphere, which is often what you want from a party
game! Your choice, as a designer, is to decide how many guesses the player gets and what
happens if they happen to guess wrong. Or what happens if a player guesses when it’s
another player’s turn!

Memory
In the days before smartphones, more party games relied on memory. After all, you had to
remember which movies Kevin Bacon appeared in before you could connect another actor to
him! Memory games can be based on remembering what another player previously did or
said as in games like The Copycat (2016).
When designing a game based on memory, make sure all players set aside their connected
digital devices to prevent temptation. You could even make the phone part of the prize—­
make a player answer trivia question without using their phone to “win” it back!

11

I guess it would be too ancient to make a “baby fish mouth” reference here, wouldn’t it?

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

Acting
The most famous party game that uses acting is Charades, but there are many variations that
have been created over the years. Some are variations on traditional Charades like Cranium
and Guesstures (1990), while others have taken a different approach. For example, in Moods
(2000), you say a word in a way that conveys the mood found on a card, and in Spontuneous
(2010) players sing to gain points!
Acting can also be used to enhance the theming or experience of a party game. Acting “in
character” during a game of Werewolf, Mafia, Snake Oil (2010), or Pitch Storm (2018) can
enhance a game’s fun. Other party games don’t just encourage play acting but demand it! The
How to Host a Murder series recommends or even includes props and costumes for the players to wear during the game.
Party games have started to combine storytelling and word guessing mechanics. Once Upon A
Time: The Storytelling Card Game (1993) has players create a cooperative story while emptying
their hand of cards. When I Dream (2018) has players acting as “spirits” who give words to a
blindfolded player who must weave the words into a story. As role-­playing games become
more popular and commonplace thanks to video conferencing and podcasts, I predict that
we will see more of these story-­centric party games in the future.

Drawing/Creating
Another popular mechanism is drawing. It doesn’t have to be drawing; it can be artistic
expression of any kind, whether it’s sculpting with clay or towers of junk. These games
scratch your itch for creativity and give you a chance to show off a little! In a drawing game,
players might draw clues as in Pictionary or Telestrations, or they might draw a communal
image like in Exquisite Corpse. Often, the results are hilarious! Don’t let “not being an artist”
get in the way of your fun!
When designing a drawing game, keep things loose to allow for a variety of interpretations.
Always include drawing implements. Consider using a dry-­
erase board in lieu of
pads of paper.

There are many different drawing games available including Draw Something Party Game
(2013), Scrawl (2016), Drawing without Dignity: An Adult Party Game of Uncensored Sketches
(2016), and A Fake Artist Goes to New York (2011), which is my personal favorite. A Fake Artist
Goes to New York has an incredible title, plus the game plays like the deduction game Spyfall
(2014)—­in which one player is the fake artist who is trying to help the other players draw a
picture cooperatively without knowing what the subject is. The other players must deduce
the identity of the fake artist. It’s a great example of how a drawing game can be combined
one from with another genre.12
Much like with acting or trivia, some players get embarrassed or sensitive about having to be
creative in front of others. I’ve already relayed the story of how I replaced drawing with
colored cards in my design for Pantone the Game to reduce this embarrassment factor. If players see that others are having fun drawing regardless of talent, perhaps it might ease the

12

You deduced that it is social deduction, right?

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

stress for them. The goal is to make the player feel as comfortable as possible when playing
the game. Drawing in the game should be fun, not stressful!
Some party games require the player to write—­that’s kind of like drawing, right? The Game
of Things (2002), Just One (2018), and Herd Mentality: The Udderly Hilarious Party Game
(2020) require players to write down clues for other players or answers to score points. Be
aware that some players might be able to differentiate one player’s handwriting from another’s, giving them a possibly unfair advantage. You might also want to avoid using different
types or colors of writing implements if you don’t want the identity of the author to be known.

Betting
We’ve talked about betting in the previous chapter, but betting can really spice up a party
game because of the excitement it creates, as seen in Wits and Wagers (2005) and Ready Set
Bet (2022). There are three factors to be found in betting games:
■■

A way of generating unknown information. This can be decided upon by a player
or generated. This can be a player selecting an answer that is bet on, a randomly drawn
card, or a dice roll that when combined with a few knowable factors creates a result.

■■

■■

A central event that you bet on. This can be “the pot,” where the players reinforce
their belief (or bluff) in the strength of their position. It can be an event, such as a race
as used in Circus Maximus (1979), Winner’s Circle (2001), or Camel Up (2014). Whatever
it is, the state of that central event is constantly changing and, with it, the state of the
things you are betting on. Also, players can blame their misfortune on the event rather
than themselves. It helps keep things a little more lighthearted, and everyone comes
away feeling better in the process!
Multiple rounds of betting to create tension and allow you to create evolving strategies. Playing a single hand of Poker is fine, but the game gets much more
interesting the longer the players play, and the pot of bids grows and shifts during play.

Be aware that sometimes players might feel like they are getting “ganged up on” when other
players bet against them. Additionally, if that player loses several bets, that “take that” aspect
of the game can really turn them off from playing.
However, the risk/reward of betting games is a big draw. Betting games often have big
swings of fortune, and it is more exciting to come back from a losing position than having a
foregone conclusion. That dopamine rush that you get from winning is what keeps players
coming back for more.

Another fun mechanic to add to a betting game is a zero card—­a betting card or token that
is worth nothing but still allows you to participate in the betting round of the game. It’s a
great mechanism for promoting bluffing in your design.

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

Bluffing
There are some who say that every party game is a bluffing game. However, bluffing can be
used as a significant part of your game design. Classics like Liar’s Dice (1800), Two Truths and
a Lie (circa 1980), and Mafia are probably the most well-­known bluffing games (especially,
when you are the werewolf), but there are newer entries in this genre such as Skull (2011),
Sheriff of Nottingham (2014), Secret Hitler (2016), and We’re Doomed (2019).

My friend and game designer James Ernest (Kill Dr. Lucky [2006], Tak [2017]) says that a
bluffing game is not just about deception, but deduction. In a bluffing game, every player has
a secret that they are trying to prevent from being discovered; if the other players were to
discover it, they would gain an advantage. There needs to be ways for you to determine what
other player’s secret is—­whether through process of elimination, contextual clues, or ways
to gain information. James warns that bluffing games should not be too complex. They
should be short on rules and long on choices.
James even suggests that the players should be able to make poor decisions during the game
on purpose—­partially to defend their own secret, without breaking the rules of the game or
destroying their chances of winning. He recommends that the designer ask themselves,
“When I make a decision, what is my range of freedom and what information does that convey? Can I make the ‘wrong choice’ as an act of concealment and does that have the potential
to benefit me even more than making the right choice?”13 Again, it comes down to giving the
players choices, especially meaningful ones!14

Repetition
A common trait that you’ll find in a party game is repetition, small repeatable actions, or segments of play. This helps the players understand the game quickly and over just a few rounds
of play. Word play party games also thrive on repetition, to the point where they transform
into memory games, as seen in the folk games King Elephant15 and tongue-­twisting game
Rigamarole.

Movement
Party games centered around physical movement date to the parlor days and earlier with
classics such as Blind Man’s Bluff, Musical Chairs, and Pass the Balloon/Orange/Tennis Ball/
Water Bottle. Modern versions of these games include Twister, Throw Throw Burrito (2019),
and Yogi Guru (2019). Players must quickly or carefully execute an action, race to a location,
or avoid another player, commonly known as “it.” These types of movement party games can
be quick or slow. These types of games are often known as dexterity games.
Slow party games require precise movements and actions to be successful. Careful aim is
required for PitchCar (1995) and Tumblin-­Dice (2004). A steady hand is needed for Beasts of
Balance (2016), Meeple Circus (2017), and Junk Art (2016). Fast-­paced party games like Spoons
(1972), Cranium Hullabaloo (2003), and Cat in the Hat: I Can Do That (2007) will keep players
moving! Just remember to remind players to play these games in a clear space; that way
nothing or no one will get banged and bumped during the game.
There is another classification of party games that is focused on drinking,16 preferably alcohol. Games like Quarters, Beer Pong, King’s Cup, Never Have I Ever, and Thumper are either
dexterity or memory games—­two attributes that become impaired the more drinking you
do. The “fun” of these kinds of games comes from watching other players screw up trying to
do somewhat simple tasks while under the influence.
I personally advise against drinking to excess, so testing these types of games can be challenging. If you see that your playtesters are overdoing it, then take responsibility and cut the
session short. As the person running the playtest, you should also provide a way for your
inebriated players to get home safely so that they don’t have to drive themselves.

Observation
In observation games you must closely watch other’s actions or listen for words over the
course of the party. Classic examples include I Spy (1889), Kim’s Game (1901), and Auto

Also known as Elephant King and Animal Kingdom.
They also say that any game can be a drinking game. Who is this mysterious “they,” and why do they have so
many opinions?

15
16

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

Bingo17 (circa 1965). Observation games can last a short, predetermined period or may last
hours or even days depending on circumstances!
Observation might also be combined with other games such as with the Little Girl role in
Werewolf. The Little Girl player may peek to see if they can spot the werewolf players, but if
she is caught by the werewolf players, she is eliminated.
Another great example of this mechanism is found in designer Sid Sackson’s The No Game
(1969), which has party guests receive a ribbon upon arrival. When another player hears a
guest say the word “no,” they collect all the ribbons they have. The last player to collect all the
ribbons wins!
Whatever type of observation-­based game you design, make sure that everyone engaged in
the game has an opportunity to observe it. We want our players to feel like they have an
equal and fair chance to win!

Judging
Judging games are games in which a player is designated as a judge and must pick a winner
from the other player’s entries. Apples to Apples, Cards Against Humanity, Dixit (2008), and
Judge Your ‘Friends’ (2021) all use this mechanism.
Judging is not my favorite mechanism. It’s too driven by personal tastes. In some cases, a
judge might give in to nepotism or favoritism, which skews the game’s outcome18 and generates sore feelings.19 Swapping the role of the judge over the course of the game such as during
each turn or over the course of several rounds helps to elevate this problem.

Let’s Make a Party Game
Now that we have all the tools to make a party game, let’s (finally!) make one!
The first step in designing a party game is to gather the components. Hmmm. Do we really
need many components to make a party game? It depends on the type of party game you
want to design. Do you want to design a complex party game that uses cards or some other
component or do we want to create a simple game, that is light on components?
I want my design to be (circle one):

17
18
19

SIMPLE

Also known as Interstate Highway Travel Bingo, Road Trip Bingo, and Bingo Travel.
This can get particularly bad when playing with couples or families.
It’s not that I’m still mad about not having my clever answer chosen. Honest.

For the game we will create here, I chose simple, so let’s make a party game about wordplay
and memory.

Step 1: Create the Rules
As we’ve done with previous games, we need to create our first draft of rules:
Memory Party Game Rules for Four or More Players
1. All players assemble in a circle around the room, the table, etc.
2. The first player says a single word related to a topic (food, school, work, games, animals, etc.) Example: “Cat”
3. The next clockwise player says a new, but different word related to the topic, as well as
the previous word said. Example: “Cat, Dog”
4. The next player does the same (say a new different word) but must also say all the
words that preceded it. Example: “Cat, Dog, Elephant”
5. Play continues around until one player makes a mistake or repeats the same word as a
previous player, and then the game ends.

Step 2: Playtest the Game
When playtesting a party game, you should playtest with variable groups of players. If you
can get them, playtest in groups of 4, 6, and 8, and if you can get enough players in the same
room, use 10 or 12 playtesters. It can be a challenge to find that many players to playtest at
once, so if you can attend a party or some other social event where you can playtest your
game, take advantage of it!
The number of players can also change the dynamic of the game. For example, in a game like
this, if there are fewer players, a player might be able to remember more words more easily,
especially since each player has come up with more of the words. It might get harder when a
player must remember someone else’s words.
Playtest our Memory Party Game with a few groups of players to see what differences happen
with larger player counts. Log the differences you see here:
When I played with 4 players: _________________________________________
When I played with 8 players: _________________________________________
When I played with 10 players: ________________________________________

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

Step 3: Change the Rules
This party game is fine, but what can we do to spice it up? Let’s make things more complicated.
Memory Party Game Rules for Four or More Players
1. All players assemble in a circle around the room, the table, etc.
2. The first player says a phrase that is longer than one word. Example: “Sally sells seashells”
3. The next clockwise player says a new but different phrase that is related to the topic
and continues the theme but includes the previous phrase. The player can use conjunctions (and, but, or) to connect their phrases. Example: “Sally sells seashells” and “I
hate sand”
4. The next player does the same (say a new different phrase) but must connect it to all of
the phrases that preceded it. Example: “Sally sells seashells” and “I hate sand” and “a sandwich is a sandwich, but a Manwich is a meal.”
5. Play continues around until one player makes a mistake, and then the game ends.
Changing the rule from a player saying a single word to a longer phrase gives each player an
opportunity to trip up the other players. Tongue twisters, movie quotes, advertising slogans,
nonsense phrases—­anything is fair game!

Step 4: Change a Number
Next, change a number related to the game. We should first revert to our original rules,
where each player says one word, but now with each new word, the next player must repeat
it the number of times that it is in the progression.
For example, if the first player says “cat,” the second player has to say “cat, dog, dog.” Then the
third player says “cat, dog, dog, elephant, elephant, elephant.” What could be fun about this
design is that the longer the repetition goes, the more absurd the repetition becomes. Plus,
this version gives the players three ways to mess up: accidentally repeating a previously said
word, messing up the order in which they occur, and not repeating the word the proper number of times.
Playtest this new version of the game and record what happened here. If you can, playtest
both versions (or all three!) and see which one your playtest group liked the best!
What happened: ___________________________________________________
The version they liked best was: ________________________________________

187

188

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Step 5: Change the Objective
No matter how many times you play this game and no matter how many players you play the
game with, this memory game is going to end the same. Someone will forget a word, get
tongue-­tied, or mess up the number of times they say something.
But what if there were a different way to win? How could the winning condition of the game
change to make it a totally different game?
What if the goal of the game was to get someone else to mess up? What if we added player
elimination to the game? With player elimination, when someone screws up, they are out.
The goal of the game becomes who can survive the longest. Playtest the new version of the
game and log the changes you see:
The result of that change was: ________________________________________
Now you come up with a different objective change! Playtest it!
My objective change is: _______________________________________________
The result of my change was: ________________________________________

Step 6: Add a Mechanism
Add a mechanism from the list presented earlier in this chapter. Memory and repetition are
already being used in the game, so let’s add. . .acting! Have each player write several names of
famous personalities with distinctive voices (Morgan Freeman, Lady Gaga, Frankenstein’s
monster, etc.) and put them in a hat (or cup or bowl or whatever). Now, whenever the player
must list all the phrases, they must do it in the “voice” of whichever character they’ve selected!
Maybe acting’s not your cup of tea. Okay, what mechanism would you add to the game?
I’m adding: __________________________________________________

Step 7: Change the Theme
Up until this step, our party game has been pretty themeless. That’s fine, but sometimes a
theme helps the players understand why they are doing an action or activity. So, let’s change
that! What if all the players were waiters/waitresses in a diner or fancy restaurant and all the
words or phrases had to be food items? Essentially, the players would be repeating orders for
the customers (to an invisible chef, I guess), and if you screw up the order, you don’t get a tip!
The player who collects the biggest tip (lasts the most rounds) wins the game.
See how just by adding a theme can help guide the gameplay?

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

Order Up! A Memory Game for Eight or More Players
1. All players assemble in a circle around the room, the table, etc.
2. The first player says the name of a food item followed by the phrase “Order Up!.”
Example: “A plate of Spaghetti! Order up!”
3. The next clockwise player says a new and different food item but must also repeat everything said by the previous player. The player can use conjunctions (and, but, or) to
connect their phrases. Example: “A bowl of hot soup and a plate of Spaghetti! Order up!”
4. The next player does the same (say a new different food item) but must connect it to all
the phrases previously said. Example: “Four and Twenty Blackbirds baked in a pie, a bowl
of hot soup and a plate of Spaghetti! Order up!.”
5. Play continues around until one player makes a mistake either by forgetting a food
item or by forgetting to say, “Order Up!,” at which point the game ends.

Now it’s your turn to add a different theme! Rewrite the rules to reflect your new theme and
how it changes your gameplay.

Ten Party Games to Play
Well, look at that! You’ve just designed your very own original party game! Nice work! While
you are thinking of your next party game design, you should gather your friends together
and try some of my favorites. Perhaps they’ll spark some new ideas!

The Minister’s Cat: A classic word game where you name words starting with the same
letter until someone says the same word as a previous player or is stumped. Play continues around the alphabet.
Exquisite Corpse: A parlor game from the 1800s in which you take turns drawing a figure onto a folded sheet of paper. When the paper is unfolded, a strange, shared creature is revealed.

In The Game of Things: In this game, players write down their answers to statements
like “Things you should never put in your mouth.” You then must guess which player
wrote what answer.
Pictionary: This is a charades game, but with drawing. Players have a limited time in
which to guess what the active player is drawing.
Werewolf: I talked at length about Werewolf, but it really is a wonderful game that can
accommodate many players. You should play it at least once.
Wits and Wagers: This is a game that doesn’t care if you know the right answer or not,
but whether you can guess which answer will get the most votes.
Codenames: This game casts the players as spies who attempt to give one-­word clues
that allow their teammates to guess as many cards as possible.
Just One: Players of Just One provide one-­word clues to a guesser; however, if more
than one clue is the same, the matching clues are disqualified.
Wavelength: This is a game that uses a unique dial that helps players narrow down their
guesses between two choices.
Captain Sonar: This game simulates submarine warfare, like a multiplayer game of
Battleship. Communication is key to winning this eight-­player game!

L e t ’s Ma ke a B o ard Game
WITHIN THIS AND the next two chapters, you will be learning how to make games that
use a board. We will focus on three types of board games in particular: an abstract strategy game, a European-­style strategy game, and a thematic strategy game. First let’s
talk about board games in general.
While you’ve been reading this book, I suspect that you’ve been wondering: what’s the difference between a tabletop game and a board game? The difference, of course, is the board!

According to game historian David Parlett,1 the word board is from the word that originally
means “plank” or “table,” as in any flat surface such as a table or the floor. You need that flat
surface to play a board game, unlike a card game or a party game, which can technically be
played anywhere.

Parlett is the author of the other great book on board games. You should read The Oxford History of Board Games
(Oxford Press, 1999) once you’re done with this one.

The board might be the single most recognizable component in all of gaming, especially the
distinctive black and white squares of a Chess board. And other than dice, the board is one of
the oldest components discovered by archeologists.2

A board represents an important part of a game’s play experience. It is the player’s focal
point. Remember the central zone of the six zones of play? It’s the game board. A board’s
dimensions and limitations help create the magic circle we talked about earlier. It is (metaphorically) a portal to another world, the realm of the player’s imagination. The board is a
place where things are instigated and happen in the game. Most importantly, it is where the
players interact with each other and with the systems that you create!

Board Games of Antiquity
The use of boards in games is old. I mean really, really old. Before modern civilization old.
Before written history old. Maybe even before spoken word old. We don’t know exactly how
old they are, and we definitely don’t know who designed them.3 As many modern abstract
games evolved from these games of antiquity, let’s take a look at some of the more
famous ones.

The only component discovered that is older than a board is dice, but that’s because dice are made from bone or
stone, while boards were made from wood, which rotted with age!

Mancala
Even before there were boards, gamers dug holes in the sand or wore out holes into rocks
that were used to play games like Mancala. Evidence of Mancala “boards” have been found all
over the world—­from ancient Egypt to the Hawaiian Islands—­that date all the way back to
the Neolithic period.
This ancient game4 uses a rectangular board with 14 holes (depressions/indents)—­6 on each
side of the board and 1 larger one at each end. Four beans (or pebbles or seeds) are placed
into the six holes, and the end holes are left empty. On a player’s turn, they pick up the contents from one hole and then, moving counterclockwise, deposit one bean at a time in each
consecutive hole. No more than four beans can be in any one hole. If a bean drops in an
empty hole, it is the end of the player’s turn. If it drops into a hole with other beans in it, the
player captures those beans for points. The large spaces on the end are where the player
stores their captured beans. When the board is down to four beans, the player with the most
beans wins.

This is the variation of the game known as Wari.

The Royal Game of Ur
Archeologists discovered intact boards and components for another board game at a royal
cemetery in the ancient Sumerian city of Ur, near the modern Iraqi city of Nasiriya. This
Royal Game of Ur (also known as the Game of Twenty Squares) dates to around 2,500 BC. The
rules to the game were unknown and thought lost for centuries until a cuneiform tablet was
translated by Dr. Irving Finkel of the British Museum in the 1980s. The tablet explained a
complicated version of the game, and Finkel was able to backward engineer the simpler version of the original game.5
Finkel discovered that the Royal Game of Ur was a race game, where the players move down a
track to their destination, like the Game of the Goose or Candy Land or the Game of Life or
Magical Athlete (2002) or hundreds of other games it inspired after it. These ancient Ur
boards were often inlaid with precious stones and shells and were mostly owned by royalty—­
the people of the ancient world who actually had leisure time to play games.

You can learn how Dr. Finkel discovered how to play the Royal Game of Ur at academia.edu/15173145/On_the_
Rules_for_the_Royal_Game_of_Ur/, and you can watch him play the game at youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I&t/.

Mehen
Another board game from antiquity is Mehan from about 2650, which has a distinctive board
in the shape of a curling snake. This copy of Mehan was found in the Egyptian tomb of Hesy
at Saqqara.
Parlett describes the game as having 3 pieces that represent lions, 3 that represent lionesses,
and 12 spheres but “how they were used is a mystery, and it has to be said that none of the
surviving pieces are small enough to fit on the individual spaces of the board they are associated with.”6
In the 1920s, British colonial administrator Reginald Davies noticed the similarities between
Mehan and a game called Lib El Merafib or The Hyena Game. Noting the similarities between
the two games, Russian game historian Dmitriy Skiryuk created his own rules for Mehan,
which involve traditional throwing sticks (that work as dice) and rolling the balls to the head
of the snake and then returning to the tail with the help of a lion, who eats any opponents in
his way!7 Whether this is the way the game was meant to be played, you have to admit that it
sounds pretty cool!

Senet
Senet is a more well-­known game than Mehan thanks to copies of the game found in Egyptian
tombs. The boy king Tutankhamun had several copies of the game, one of which was a miniature “travel-­sized” version!
Senet is a race game, like The Royal Game of Ur, but it is laden with religious symbolism. It is
said that those who mastered playing the game could navigate their way down the treacherous path to the afterlife! As exciting as that game sounds, player interest in Senet died out
around 500 BC in favor of more playable and less preachy games.

Nine Man’s Morris
The term Morris come from the Latin merellus or game piece.8 There are many variations of
this game, including Three-­, Five-­, Six-­, and Twelve-­Man’s Morris, and Cowboy Checkers. You
might know this ancient game if you’ve played the Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag video game.
It’s a game that dates to back to Egypt around 1400 BC where players add, move, and capture
stones on a nine-­point grid to be the last one standing. It became exceedingly popular in
Europe. The game is even mentioned in one of Shakespeare’s plays!9
A fun fact is that gaming archeologists believe that when the game was incorrectly10 played
by gamers who placed their stones inside the spaces instead of the connection points on the
lines, they created the game Naughts and Crosses or Tic Tac Toe. This capture-­the-­space gameplay evolved into games such as Hex (1940), Twixt (1970), and Connect Four (1974).

Chess
It’s Chess! Who doesn’t know Chess? Do I really have to explain Chess? You have 16 pieces per
player on an 8×8 grid. The pieces—­king, queen, bishop, knight, rook, and pawn—­have different movement types. The goal is to capture your opponent’s king.
Chess is arguably the most known of all board games. Its pieces are iconic. The game has been
the poster child of board gaming for more than 1,000 years in the Western world. No game
in human history has been more analyzed, scrutinized, and revered. There have been entire
books, plays, documentary films, and TV shows dedicated to the game,11 and its popularity
doesn’t seem to be slowing down.

The original name of this ancient game is Merels or Mills, which is a corruption of Miles, which is Latin for “soldier.”
That would be A Midsummer’s Night Dream from the 16th century.

Or was it purposely? You know how gamers love to come up with their own house rules for games!

Chess historians claim that the game evolved from Chaturanga, which was invented in 7th
century Persia. The game spread across the Middle East to Europe during the Crusades,
where it dominated Western board gaming for the next 1,422 years. It also spread to Asia
where it evolved into Xiang-­qi (China), Chaggi (Korea), and Shogi (Japan) among others. Its
cousin, Draughts or Checkers, evolved not from Chess, but rather from Alquerque, an 11th
century game.

Backgammon
Backgammon in its modern incarnation first evolved from the 6th century game Nardshir. By
the 17th century, the game was worldwide and maybe even more popular than Chess. Did you
know it’s the national game of eight Middle Eastern countries? Did you know that archeologists discovered two medieval manuscripts each depicting a couple playing a game of “strip-­
backgammon”? Did you know that the liquor manufacturer Seagram and a deposed Russian
aristocrat mounted a million-­dollar campaign in the 1970s to promote the game? It’s all true.
A big part of Backgammon’s popularity is its simplicity. Each player uses dice to move their
pieces around to the other side and off the board. The player who gets all their pieces off first
wins. Opposing pieces can land on your pieces during movement, sending them back to the
beginning—­much like in Senet. Protecting your pieces as you move them is a major strategy
of the game.

Hnefatafl
Another exciting game from antiquity is Hnefatafl (pronounced “Nef-­a-­Ta-­ful”) is a grid-­
based board game that originates from medieval Scandinavia. In this two-­player game, one
plays a Viking clan that is outnumbered by a larger army. The army tries to capture the king
by surrounding him, while the Vikings protect the king while eliminating the army’s soldiers.

Snakes and Ladders
From the 13th century, 13th century India’s Gyan Chauper (The Game of Knowledge) was later
called Snakes and Ladders. Snakes and Ladders is a metaphor in board game form for the ups and
downs of life as the players try to climb the board’s 100 squares to reach spiritual enlightenment.
With the colonization of India, Snakes and Ladders came to Britain where it was almost
immediately patented and sold. American game publisher Milton Bradley rebranded Snakes
and Ladders as The Checkered Game of Life (1860), launching his board gaming empire.

Ancient Games Are Still Around
It’s amazing to realize how old many of these games are and the fact that you can go into your
local store and still buy many of these ancient games. As a game designer, it’s a sobering
thought to realize that these games of antiquity are still your competition as a game designer.
It doesn’t matter how cool or awesome or innovative your new game design is, you are still
competing for shelf space with game designs that are hundreds, if not thousands, of years old!
If you want to learn more about the history of these ancient games, I suggest reading Parlett’s
book as well as watching this great lecture given by Quintin Smith of the Shut Up and Sit
Down YouTube channel (youtube.com/watch?v=Gov-­qrjvOTc). Smith covers several thousand years of history in less than 40 minutes, and he’s quite entertaining too!

Types and Elements of Game Boards
Up until now, we’ve been designing games that don’t necessarily require a board to play, but
there are reasons and distinct advantages to having one in your design. Let’s examine the
different types of boards, what makes them different from each other, and how you can use
those elements in your design.

The board carries the information about the game’s location, the player’s interactions, and
their choices. The layout of a board can be simple like Pictionary (1987), complicated like
Shadows Over Camelot (2005), or wildly complex like Kanban EV (2020). It can be a variety of
shapes from square to rectangular to a circle.

CHAPTER 7

L e t ’ s M a k e a B oard G am e

Game Board Grids
A grid indicates all the places that pieces can be placed or moved onto. The series of crisscrossed lines of a game board can be a simple 8×8 grid like in Chess or a large 19×19 grid as
found in Go.12 Depending on the rules, pieces can be moved on the spaces between the lines
such as in Checkers or along the lines like in Nine Man’s Morris.
While a simple grid is often a great place to start when developing a new game design, many
game publishers believe a chess-­like grid to be “too basic” for modern players.
I’ve seen too many games by amateur designers who have created “a new version of Chess”—­a
concept that I personally don’t find very interesting. If the last 40 years of game design have
proved anything, it is that there are so many more types of games to be made than just
another rehash of a centuries-­old game.

Game Board Tracks
A track, or racetrack, is a path on which players move along or race to a destination. A player
might just go around and around the track for the entire game. A track is found on some of
the earliest board games from the Royal Game of Ur to The Game of Life (1969).
Board game tracks are divided into spaces (or squares) that the player travels along, moving
one space at a time or sometimes more often determined by a roll of a die or by action points.
In Candy Land, the player’s movement along the track is guided by whatever colored card the
player draws. Most of the time, the player moves forward toward the end of the track, but
sometimes they might go backward!
12

They can also be ridiculously large like with Shogi’s 36⋅36 board!

203

204

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Track games are sometimes considered by some publishers to be too “old fashioned” for
modern gameplayers. However, I refuse to believe that as there are many modern game
designs that use or even improve on this element, games such as Jamaica (2007), Great
Western Trail (2016), Flamme Rogue (2016), and Heaven and Ale (2017).
Space

Line

Game Board Spaces
The space is a place to be filled, where the line is something to be followed. This philosophy
about these two board elements can be used to influence the direction of your design. Boards
with lines are faster paced—­think of the long slides in Chutes and Ladders (200 BC) or long
swooping lines of Tsuro (2005). Compare that to the slower (even exploratory) movement
found in the game Clue (1947) or Nemesis (2018).
Unlike lines, spaces can be filled with information, special rules, and situations that impact
gameplay. Think of them as mini cards that are permanently (but not always; we will talk
about that later) set in the game.
There are two types of locations on a game board: a shared space and a unique space. A
shared space is some place that multiple players can take advantage of or might have a
resource that all players can access. A unique space is available to only a single player or component at a time. Gameplay often revolves around trying to gain control of that space. Let’s
examine the different types of spaces available to us as designers.
■■

■■

Information spaces are spaces on a track that can be used to display text, colors, or
images/icons that represent information. This information might change the game’s
rules or add special cases or temporary rules.
For example, in the Royal Game of Ur, if you land on a flower space, you are protected
from getting “jumped” by your opponent. On the track found in Candy Land, there are

L e t ’ s M a k e a B oard G am e

spots with candies such as a peppermint, gumdrop, etc. When a player draws a card
with that image on it, they move directly to that space.13
When making these types of spaces, be sure to use clear fonts and colors (avoid white
or red text on black, for example) and that your artwork/icons are distinguishable
from a distance. Your players are going to be looking at them from across the table, so
don’t make them too small to see!
Worker spaces are spaces on a board where a worker (represented by a pawn, token,
or meeple) is placed to collect a resource or gain an advantage. We will be talking more
about worker placement games in detail (and even making one) in the Chapter 8!
Resource spaces are spaces where resources are kept and collected—­whether it is
coins, wooden resources, or tokens. This location doubles as an organizational space
(think of it like a bank) and a space for players to collect the resource like in the previously mentioned worker space.
Make sure to use text or visuals to indicate where the resources are placed. You can also
use symbolic imagery such as coins being placed in the bank, apples being placed in the
orchard, etc.
In ALIEN: Fate of the Nostromo (2020), icons on the board correspond with icons found
on the cards that were generated. This helps the players see where the resources are to
be placed. You can never provide enough information to help players find things
quickly and speed up gameplay.
Card spaces are where decks of cards go. It helps if the space is sized to the actual card
size. You might also want to put the image on the card back on the space to help guide
the player during setup.
Spawn spaces are spaces that spawn components such as enemies, resources, etc.
The icon should be distinct from all other game images, and the space should be clearly
marked so that players can place the components quickly during the game. Enemy
spawn points should never be the same as a player spawn point. It’s no fair for a player
who is returning to play to have to immediately deal with enemies as well. . .unless you
are designing a difficult game!
Art spaces are spaces that feature artwork to keep the game board track from looking
too boring or empty. However, when creating an art space on your board, be careful
that the art doesn’t look like a space that has a function in the game. For example, if
your game has players creating and placing little houses onto spaces on the board,
