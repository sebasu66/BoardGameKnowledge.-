break the tie. This can be exciting but time-consuming. For certain
tie-breakers, most notably if players are tied at the end of the game,
breaking the tie randomly will be unsatisfying for players.
• Secondary Values: Components have a unique secondary value that
is used to break ties. For example, in Libertalia, the role cards have a
number on them that says when in sequence they should be played. For
example, the Monkey card is #2, and is executed before the Cabin Boy
which is #5. If two players both play a Monkey, they both have #2 on
them. However, to resolve the tie, there is a smaller Flag number on each
card, which is unique between all players. For example, one player has a 3
Flag on their Monkey card, while another has a 5, so the 3 would go first.
The flag numbers are distributed so that on average each player will win
the same number of ties. This gives a quick and simple way to break ties.
The procedures described above, like in Libertalia and Rising Sun,
determine which player wins the tie. However, some games award a tiebreaking ability to a specific player, who then decides which player is chosen.
For example, in A Game of Thrones, the player that wins the auction for the
Throne gains the ability to decide who wins all ties. This immediately brings
Negotiation elements into the game, (ECO-18) as players can lobby the
player who resolves ties.
It is also possible to not have a tie-breaker. For in-game resolutions, ties
may be resolved as friendly or unfriendly. A friendly resolution means that all
tied players gain the benefit of the action. If the leader in a particular category
scores ten points, for example, if players are tied, they all score the ten points.

154

In unfriendly ties, tied players receive a reduced award or no award at all.
Either way all players are treated equally.
For final victory, some games do not offer tie-breakers, and have the
players share in the victory. This may or may not be acceptable to players
depending on the likelihood of ties and the length and seriousness of the
game. If possible, tie-breakers for final victory should reward the players who
have had a harder route to win, for example by going last in the turn order,
by acquiring a harder-to-obtain resource, or by using fewer resources overall.

Dice Selection

Description
Player rolls multiple dice and selects one based on a rule.

Discussion
In this Dice Selection mechanism, players roll a set number of dice and choose
one of them to represent the result. The most common implementation of
this has players roll two dice and select the highest or lowest. Dungeons &
Dragons uses this system and refers to the two states as “advantaged” and
“disadvantaged.” An alternative is for players to roll three dice, and to choose
the median die.
A High/Low selection is a way for designers to skew single die results fairly
significantly towards the high or low end. Conversely, a median selection
system makes extreme results unlikely.

The table above shows the chances of rolling different numbers with a
standard die roll, rolling 2 dice and selecting the highest (or lowest), and
rolling 3 dice and selecting the middle value. Rolling 2 dice and selecting the
highest almost doubles the chances of a result of 6, and a result of 1 is 80%
less likely than with a standard die roll. Selecting the middle out of 3 dice
emphasizes results of 3 and 4, while cutting the chances of a 1 or 6 in half
compared to standard roll.
Root presents a related system, where 2 dice are rolled for battles, with the
Attacker taking the higher roll, and the defender the lower. This encourages
aggression.

Action Speed

Description
Actions are rated for a speed or initiative. Faster actions are executed first.

Discussion
This system is most commonly used in Simultaneous Action systems
(TRN-09). In Critical Mass, each player selects an action card from their
hand and plays it simultaneously. Each is rated for speed, and faster actions
go sooner than slower ones.
Critical Mass uses numeric speed ratings. Some games use descriptors,
which can be as simple as Fast or Slow, as in The Ares Project, or more thematic,
like First Strike in Magic: The Gathering.
While this often represents the speed of an action, it can also be more
abstract. In Libertalia, characters have a priority rating, and operate in order
of priority, from lowest number to highest.
Typically if actions have the same speed, they are resolved simultaneously,
although a tie-breaker may be used (RES-18). Each card in Libertalia, for
example, has a unique number on it as a secondary tie-breaker.

158

Speed ratings give players a clear indication of the order of execution of
actions, and the designer another resource to use for balance purposes. Faster
actions can be weaker, while slower actions can be more powerful, but more
likely to not take effect.

Rerolling and Locking

Description
Dice may be rerolled, or may be locked, preventing rerolling.

Discussion
Many people are first exposed to the idea of Rerolling through the classic
game Yahtzee. After rolling, the player may choose to reroll any number of
dice, and may do this twice, for a total of three throws. Yahtzee illustrates
some typical characteristics of reroll systems:
• When dice are rerolled you must take the result (you can’t go back to
the first result)
• You can reroll dice regardless of whether they were rerolled or not
There are variations on this, of course, but this is typical.
From a simplistic perspective, where you are interested only in how high the
number rolled is, assuming the player rerolls anything that is less than a “4,”
the reroll will add, on average, 0.75 to the final number. While it is similar in
result to a +1 modifier, rerolls are experienced differently by the player. First,
the player is choosing whether to reroll or not. This gives them finer-grained
control and gives more tactical nuance to the act of rolling than just gaining a

160

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

set modifier. Also, rolling dice can be inherently exciting, and rerolls make that
happen more frequently. Finally, modifiers (as discussed in RES-02), even +1
modifiers, add to player cognitive load. Just looking at the die result is simpler.
However, unlike modifiers, rerolls can result in the final result being worse
than the initial roll. Whether this is desirable for the experience is a decision
that needs to be determined by the designer.
The opposite mechanism to rerolling is Locking. In a Locking mechanism,
certain die faces cannot be rerolled. They are stuck on that face for the
remainder of the turn. Having a combination of rerolls and locks brings a
Push Your Luck mechanism (UNC-02) to the table, as players need to risk
improving their result with locking more dice. Zombie Dice is one of many
games to implement this combination, as shotgun blast results are locked, and
getting three shotgun blasts in total ends your turn with a bust.
Escape: The Curse of the Temple uses locked dice in a real-time dice rolling
game to force players to interact with each other (to help unlock the dice of
other players), and in general to disrupt the players’ flow and force them to
make some tough decisions.

Kill Steal

Description
Players contribute towards completing a task, but only the player who finally
completes it gets a benefit.

Discussion
This Kill Steal mechanism originated in video games, which is where the term
came from. In tabletop games, it is most frequently seen in combat games,
where the player scoring the last hit to kill a creature gains the experience,
treasure, or other reward.
In Cutthroat Caverns, players are trying to defeat creatures to reach and
defeat the final boss and win the game. If all players are killed, they all lose,
but if at least one survives, the player with the most points wins. See SemiCo-Op (STR-05) for more details about this type of game structure. But

162

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

while all players collectively battle creatures, only the player that lands the
final hit that kills it gains the points. This adds a lot of interesting dynamics
as players maneuver to land that final blow.
Similarly, in the purely competitive games Dungeon Run, Wildlands, and
Space Freaks, as players attack, if monsters or other players are not defeated,
the damage they suffer carries over. Whichever player actually reduces the
health to zero gains the reward.
This mechanism is easy for players to understand and work with, but
it does make things more contentious and raises the stakes, as if you are
performing an attack that should defeat an enemy, but you get unlucky and it
doesn’t, other players can swoop in for the kill, and your efforts are for naught.
Some conflict games, like Adrenaline, avoid Kill Stealing by giving points to
all players who contributed in defeating that opponent, but at the expense of
additional bookkeeping to track who caused what damage.
This mechanism is not limited to combat. It has been used in an economic
game like Valparaiso, where players construct buildings in districts, but the
player who constructs the final house gets a bonus, or an abstract like 6
Nimmt, where players place cards into rows based on their number, and the
person who plays the sixth card takes the whole row (although taking rows is
a bad thing, so perhaps this is better classified as a Reverse Kill Steal).
There are echoes of this mechanism in Gating and Unlocking (ACT-15), as
many games have tracks that players advance on, but the first player to reach
a certain space gets a one-time bonus.

Game End and Victory

ӶӶ
Two characteristics that separate games from other activities are having a
goal and a defined end-game point. Even in a role-playing game (RPG),
which may not have a formal end-game point, a campaign or narrative arc
reaches a climax, and though the characters may continue on to the next
adventure, goals still exist. Achieving goals, or achieving them better than
other players, defines who wins the game. Goals and end-game points are
frequently intertwined in games, so we are exploring them together in this
chapter. The first section primarily features ways of determining the winner,
and the second section contains triggers for ending the game. We conclude
this chapter by looking at several ancillary considerations for these topics.
The first few mechanisms detail different aspects of Victory Points (VPs).
Giving points to players is a straightforward way to determine who wins a
game. Indeed, any victory system can be expressed as VPs. For example,
Snakes & Ladders, which is a Race game (VIC-07), could be treated as having
points. Rather than reaching square 100, players have points based on the
square they are on. The first player to get 100 points (exactly) is the winner
and ends the game. This is a trivial example, but designers should be on the
lookout for other ways to define victory that better meet the theme of the
game. For example, in many business or economic games, the victory goes
to the player with the most money, or the one who surpasses a monetary
threshold.
Many games allow players to collect points from several different activities.
Thousands of years ago, Go allowed the players to score points by both
surrounding territory and capturing enemy stones. Having multiple ways to
gain points gives players multiple strategic approaches and allows players to
judge the relative values of actions.

Victory Points from Game State

Description
An event causes the Game State to be evaluated relative to some scoring
condition. Players earn points based upon how that state matches the
condition.

Discussion
In most points-based games, players manipulate the Game State and then
gain points based on that State. In some games, like 7 Wonders or Agricola,
points are only tallied at the end of the game. However, there are a variety
of ways scoring can be triggered, which can be grouped broadly into three
categories: Scheduled, Player Action, and Random systems.
In Scheduled systems, there are predefined intervals for when scoring will
happen, and players know when they are approaching. For example, in El
Grande, scoring happens three times during the game, after a set number of
rounds. Regardless of which actions the players take, scoring will happen at
exactly those intervals. In Galaxy Trucker, players score at the end of each run,
when a fixed number of hazards are encountered.
In a Player Action system, players are the ones who trigger scoring.
Sometimes this is completely at the discretion of the players, and sometimes
the precise timing falls within a band of possible values. For example, in
Twilight Struggle, players that are dealt a Region Scoring card must play it
sometime during that hand. However, the exact timing is dependent on a
Player Action. The Expanse Board Game is more open-ended, as players can
draft a scoring card any time one is available. They do not have to do it within
a certain time frame.

Game End and Victory

165

In a Random system, there are scoring cards or tokens that are mixed in
with other items. When these are drawn, scoring occurs. In Airlines, Scoring
cards are shuffled into the deck. As each is drawn, scoring happens. The
drawing of the last card also ends the game (VIC-12). In practice, truly
random scoring systems are rare. Frequently, scoring cards are shuffled into
the bottom third of the deck, or some similar range. Other random triggers
involve seeing two, or even three more of the same type of card, as in Incan
Gold, where the second hazard of the same type drawn ends the round, or
Ethnos, where the third dragon drawn ends the age. These systems are random,
but their likely outcomes fall within a predictable range.
Games that score just one time, at game end, can fall into any of these
categories depending on how the end of game is triggered.
Many systems are a blend between these categories. Twilight Struggle has
elements of all three, as Scoring is under player control (somewhat), must
occur by a definite point in the game (Scheduled), but it is also Random in
that it is not known in which round the Region Scoring cards will be in play.
Rather than seeing these differences as categorical, we can say that scoring
systems have some or all of these characteristics.
Area Majority (ARC-02) and Economic games (Chapter 7) in particular
tend to use the VP from Game State mechanism. Area Majority games are
very concerned about board state, and their core concept is maneuvering
your resources to be able to obtain the most majorities when scoring is
triggered. Similarly, in Economic Games, where money is often a proxy for
VPs, businesses can pay out based on the state of the boards and markets.
Power Grid, for example, pays out money based on connected cities at the
end of each turn.
A Scheduled trigger is best suited for more strategic games, as it allows for
long-term planning. Random triggers are excellent at creating tension but
can reward players who simply happened to be in a superior position when
scoring occurs. Player Action triggers can be highly strategic or quite tactical,
depending on implementation. Players can plan and trigger scoring when it is
most beneficial to them, leading to interesting choices. It can also add tension
as other players try to take advantage of another player triggering scoring,
particularly in games where the possibility of a scoring option is hidden (as
in Twilight Struggle).
While Scheduled trigger systems are more strategic, they can also lead to bad
edge effects. An “edge effect” is a distortion of gameplay when it approaches a
boundary. If players know exactly when scoring will occur, the final actions
leading up to scoring can be subject to over-analysis and game-lengthening

166

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

delays as players attempt to optimize their scores, particularly if there are
no hidden elements. Depending on the nature of the game, this can impact
players’ enjoyment.
Some Schedule-based systems put scoring at the end of each player’s
turn, like Small World and Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization. Because
of the proximity of the player’s actions to when scoring occurs, this blurs
with Victory Points from Player Actions (VIC-02). It is worth noting that
sometimes these systems award points at the start of a player’s turn, not the
end; King of Tokyo is an example. This means that players need to maintain
their state as the other players take their turns and can lead to interesting
interactions.

Victory Points from Player Actions

Description
Players earn points by performing actions.

Discussion
In contrast with Victory Points from Game State, this mechanism gives players
points based on discrete actions which may be very local. An example would
be capturing stones in Go, where each stone is worth one point. Surrounding
territory in Go, the other way of scoring points, is only evaluated at the end of
the game, and until that point can be invaded, shrunk, or expanded.
Eclipse and Kemet offer Victory Points (VPs) for winning battles. Many
games, like Lords of Waterdeep, Nexus Ops, or Splendor, have players take
actions to complete or claim private or public goal cards (VIC-11), which are
worth points.
The relationship between the Action that you perform to gain VPs and
how that affects your position and the game state has an important impact
on the flow of the game. In some, like Lords of Waterdeep, completing quest
cards is the main point of the game, and doesn’t aid or hinder your ability to
perform other actions in the future.
However, in games like Dominion and Splendor, taking Victory cards can
hinder your ability to gain more Victory cards. In Dominion, the point cards
become part of your deck, but they have no purpose if drawn. They simply
clog things up. In Splendor, purchasing high value cards does not give you as
much of a “bang for your buck” for getting gem bonuses as purchasing lower
cost cards. In these games, the players need to choose between building up
their engine or economy and cashing in on it. It creates what we call a “pivot,”

168

where players need to transition between building and scoring. This can be
an interesting puzzle for players to work through.

VIC-03 Temporary and Permanent Victory Points

Description
Some Victory Points (VPs) are never lost. Others depend on the game state
and may be lost if that state changes.

Discussion
This mechanism is typically used in games where the ending condition is a
player reaching a certain number of VPs. For example, in Catan the game
ends when a player reaches 10 points. In Kemet it ends when a player reaches
8 points.
Gaining permanent VPs is important to help drive the game to a conclusion.
If all points are temporary, it encourages players to try to take down the
leader, and pull them further away from winning, which can lengthen the
game. Munchkin, where player level is a proxy for VPs, has this issue, as do
Dune and Cosmic Encounter, which require players to hold a certain number
of spaces.
Having a mix of temporary and permanent points is a good way of dealing
with this issue, as it both drives the game towards a conclusion and offers
opportunities for players to make a sudden grab for victory or move their
opponents away from victory if they have a lot of temporary points.
Kemet is a good example of this technique. Permanent VPs are gained
through winning battles, controlling temples, certain Power cards, and other
means. Temporary points are gained by holding special regions on the board.

170

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

So, if a player has a bank of VPs but is a few points shy of victory, he or she
can launch attacks on spaces to try to gain those last few points and win. This
can lead to dramatic moments in the game and can also incentivize players to
over-extend themselves and take a chance, which increases tension.

Victory Points as a Resource

Description
Victory Points (VPs) may be spent as a currency to impact the game state.

Discussion
Economic games, where money represents victory, are the primary examples
of this mechanism. Having players spend and invest money to make more
money is at the core of business and finds representation in many business
games. This forces players to think about valuation and Return On Investment
(ROI) as key drivers in their decisions. What is the expected payback on the
available options?
This mechanism is also used outside of economic games as well. Small
World is a great example, where players must spend VPs to skip over certain
options on a Draft Track, creating an auction-like mechanic for valuing the
races available (AUC-08).
Typically, players will be more cautious about spending VPs when they are
not themed as money. In the context of an Economic game, players may not
even really think about money as a “Victory Point” currency. We are so used
to using it in our everyday lives that we inherently understand the concept
of investing for future payout. However, when they are represented as a VPs,
Honor, or other thematic element, they take on a different connotation, and
players tend to be more emotionally attached to them.
Understanding this underlying psychology gives the designer another tool
for shaping the player experience.

Hidden and Exposed Victory Points

Description
Victory Points (VPs) may be public or private information.

Discussion
The decision of whether to have the number of VPs each player has be public
or private information can have a big impact on the play experience. It is
particularly dependent on the method for ending the game, and the overall
amount of hidden and public information.
If a game has a set number of turns, so that players know exactly when
the end is coming, and most information is public, including VPs, it can
lead to over-analysis during the last turn, as players try to optimize that last
play. Alternatively, there can be situations where the last turn is meaningless
because the leading player cannot be unseated (in which case consider VIC-15
Short Circuits). Typically, this is considered undesirable by players, although
certain types of games and players can support this. If the points are hidden, or
if players are not sure what other players can do, through hidden information,
this tendency is alleviated.
As an example, the 1999 game, Vinci, had players controlling civilizations
that would rise and fall across Europe. Scores were open, and the number
of turns was fixed. Vinci was in general positively regarded; however, many
reviewers found the final turn very unsatisfying. Players scored points at

174

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

the end of their turn, and turns were deterministic. Players could calculate
exactly how to maximize their score, and often spent quite a bit of time doing
so, to squeeze out one more point. Years later, the game was reworked and
re-released as Small World. The main structural change was the introduction
of hidden scores, and a minor random element. These changes were sufficient
to alleviate the last turn issue, and give the game a much lighter feel, turning
it into one of the staples of the hobby gaming market.
Conversely, having too many hidden bonus points at the end of the game
can lead to an unsatisfying play experience. See VIC-06 for a full discussion.

End-Game Bonuses

Description
Players earn bonus Victory Points (VPs) at the end of the game.

Discussion
This is a popular technique for giving players strategic direction. Giving
players a specific goal to earn points early in the game gives new players an
idea of what they should be doing.
End-Game Bonuses can be either Personal or Public. Points from Personal
goals can only be earned by the owner, while Public goals may be pursued by
multiple players. In some games, goals are non-exclusive, and can be scored
by multiple players, while in others, only the player who achieves the goal “the
best” receives the points.
Public goals provide a natural interaction point for players and can be used
where there is not as much player interaction through the other mechanisms.
In their simplest form, public goals are a method for turning any puzzle into a
competitive game. In Dimension, for example, players use the same set of spheres
to build a pyramid that satisfies as many of the six public goals as possible.
Private goals help differentiate players and can give a strong direction to
their play. For example, in Ticket to Ride, the tickets tell players which cities
to connect, but points are awarded (or lost) only at the end of the game. This
gives players a literal roadmap of their goals.

176

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

There are a number of benefits of keeping personal goals hidden, like
making it impossible to precisely determine who is winning and adding an
element of deduction as players attempt to block each other. Ticket to Ride
with exposed goals would be a very different, and more frustrating, experience.
Another design consideration is when and how goals are assigned. Sometimes
they are random, and sometimes players must construct or choose their goals.
A concern for designers is that if goals are assigned randomly, later in the game
players may luck into points by being randomly dealt a goal that they have already
achieved. This is one reason earlier assignment of bonuses is generally preferred,
unless countered by a penalty for not achieving them (as in Ticket to Ride). Games
such as Race for the Galaxy may give players access to a random selection
of possible End-Game Bonuses, but players may choose to build them or not.
Concordia allows players to draft cards which will give bonus points in specific
categories. Having more cards in a given category increases the point value.
Terraforming Mars has an interesting approach to assigning end-game
goals. Players may use an action and spend money to unlock specific public
End-Game Bonuses. The amount of money required increases each time a
new goal is unlocked, so waiting until you are certain about what you want
to unlock means spending more resources. Only three goals at most, can be
unlocked, putting more pressure on players to decide which goals they think
they can win at.
Designers should also consider the ratio between points earned during the
game and points earned at the end. If the ratio is very large, and bonuses are
complex or hidden, it can be very difficult for players to know where they
stand. This increases the skill and experience required to play the game well.
For example, in Concordia, all points are earned from End-Game Bonuses.
To offset that issue, the game includes an optional intermediate scoring
step which is basically a practice scoring so that players can make sure they
understand the available bonuses, as well as get a better feel for their relative
position.

Race

Description
The winner is the first player to reach the end of a track.

Discussion
This mechanism is both a way of determining when the game ends and
determining a victory. Both typically occur at the same time as one or more
players cross a finish line or reach a goal.
Some of the oldest games in human history are Race games, including
Senet, Backgammon, Snakes & Ladders, and Parcheesi. They are intuitive about
the goal and it is clear who is in the lead at any point.
There are a variety of games that are mechanically Race games, but don’t
have the trappings of a physical race. Any game that has players trying to
reach a certain target quantity of Victory Points (VPs) is, in essence, a race
game. Catan is a race to get to 10 points. Empire Builder is a race to get to
$250,000,000.
Conversely, there are games that appear to be a Race, but that are actually
not. Typically, these involve betting on the outcome of a race, as in Royal Turf,
Downforce, and Long Shot. These are actually equivalent to VIC-01 Victory
Points from Game State, where the situation on the board feeds into a point
total.
More discussion on actual Race mechanisms are included in Chapter 10,
“Movement.”

Player Elimination

Description
The winner is the only player remaining in the game.

Discussion
Player Elimination is typically considered an anti-pattern, a mechanism to
be avoided. From a purely practical standpoint, elimination may result in
a player not being able to participate with the group for an hour or more,
leading to awkward social situations.
However, it can be effectively used in shorter and lighter games that may be
played multiple times in rapid succession. If being eliminated means that you
are out of the game for 5 or 10 minutes, as in Love Letter or Liar’s Dice, that
is very different than being eliminated early from a game of Risk or Monopoly.
Player Elimination can also be effective if it fits into the narrative and
theme of the game. For example, winning in Nuclear War requires all players
but one to be eliminated. However, when a player is eliminated, they are given
a special Final Retaliation turn where they can launch all the missiles that
remain in their hands at the players of their choice. This is both satisfying and
thematically consonant, and results in many plays having no winner at all.
A different social dynamic arises in team-based games with elimination,
like Werewolf. After being eliminated, players can still participate vicariously,
as they may still be part of the winning team. Werewolf also benefits from
being interesting for non-participants to watch.

BANG! extends this two-team concept by adding a third side that switches
allegiance. The two main teams are the Lawmen (led by the Sheriff) and the
Outlaws. The Outlaws win if the Sheriff is killed. The Lawmen win if the
Outlaws and the Renegade are killed. The Renegade wins if all the Lawmen
and Outlaws are killed. The Renegade’s strategy is to initially help protect the
Sheriff, and then turn on the Lawmen once the Outlaws are eliminated. Since
roles are hidden, this makes for a very exciting dynamic, even for players who
have been eliminated, as their team may still win.
Another variation on Player Elimination is End-Game Elimination. Based
on certain criteria, one or more players may be eliminated from the possibility
of winning the game. For example, in High Society, players spend money to
gain objects that are worth Victory Points (VPs). The player with the most
VPs wins, except that the player with the least money remaining cannot
win, so players need to track what other players are doing and avoid overspending. Similarly, in Cleopatra and the Society of Architects, players may
take more powerful actions by taking Corruption tokens. At the end of the
game, the hidden Corruption totals are revealed, and the player with the most
Corruption cannot win.
While these examples are deterministic, End-Game Elimination can
also be applied randomly. For example, in The Hunger Games: District 12
Strategy Game, during the game players may choose to, or be forced to, place
tokens into the Tribute pool. At the end of the game, one Tribute token is
drawn at random, and the player it belongs to is eliminated from a chance
at victory. This system gives players a chance to do risk-reward analysis and
is highly thematic with the source material. However, in general, it is not
received as favorably as a deterministic End-Game Elimination mechanism
as players may have many fewer tokens in the pool and still get chosen,
making them feel they lost due to an unlucky break rather than mistakes
they made.

Fixed Number of Rounds

Description
The game ends after a set number of rounds.

Discussion
This is a basic approach to determine when the game will end. However, there
are still some considerations for the designer.
First, players must track the current round, often with a marker on a track.
It’s not a big burden on the players, but it does require them to remember to
advance the token at the end of each round.
If possible, a more natural way of tracking the current round is advised.
An elegant approach is to have items used in the game come off of the round
tracker, instead of pushing a maker along it. In Castles of Burgundy, the new
building tiles that populate the board each round are divided into stacks and
placed on the round tracker. Those tiles are placed on the board each turn,
which is a step players are unlikely to forget, and players can glance at the
round tracker and see, based on how many stacks remain, how many rounds
are left in the game.
Similar techniques can be used for an end-game trigger. The Speicherstadt
has a deck with a fixed number of cards. When the cards run out, the game
is over. This eliminates the need for players to act to advance a marker. The
depletion of the cards happens naturally over the course of the game. The

Game End and Victory

183

number of turns and rounds is the same every game—but the players do not
directly track them.
For example, in Modern Art, the end of each round features the valuation of
paintings, with players placing markers for the most valuable paintings for that
round. However, there are only three slots for these markers, corresponding
to the rounds in the game. The valuation step will not be missed by players,
so this does not increase the rules’ burden on the players.
The other consideration is end-game edge effects. If the players know
that this is the final round, it may change their behavior, which may be
undesirable. One aspect of this is discussed in Hidden and Exposed Victory
Points (VIC-05).

Exhausting Resources

Description
The game end is triggered by a resource being exhausted. Players can affect
the length of the game by how these resources are used.

Discussion
The Exhausting Resources mechanism is a nice balance between driving
the game towards a conclusion and giving the players some control over the
pacing.
In the 18xx series of games, the game end is triggered by all money being
taken out of the bank. In Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, when the
final Age III cards are drawn, the game ends, giving players the option to
draw a lot or a few of the cards to manage the pace. Race for the Galaxy has a
pool of Victory Point (VP) tokens, which end the game when exhausted, and
Dominion concludes when three stacks are exhausted.
While these examples all have a shared resource pool, some games end
when an individual pool is exhausted. Ticket to Ride ends when one player
has 0–2 trains left. In Light Speed, the game moves on to final scoring after
one player has placed all of their ships on the table.
This technique is frequently used as a loss condition for cooperative games.
For example, in Pandemic, having to place a disease cube but having none

Game End and Victory

185

available in the pool will end the game in a loss, as will placing all the ghosts
in Ghost Fightin’ Treasure Hunters.

Completing Targets

Description
The game ends after a set number of targets or goals are completed.

Discussion
In one sense the Completing Target mechanism is related to Exhausting
Resources (VIC-10), as meeting X targets could be represented by removing
“mission accomplished” markers from a pool and having the game end when
those markers are exhausted. The difference in player experience is substantial,
though, and gaining accomplishments is thematically more coherent in most
cases than exhausting “mission accomplished” tokens.
Completing Targets is also similar to Race end-game conditions, where
the game ends when players hit (typically) a victory point goal. However, the
goals can be more than just the accumulation of points, such as curing all
diseases in Pandemic, taking enough keeps in Dune, or destroying the One
Ring in War of the Ring.
In all of these examples, the game is won by the player(s) triggering the
event that ends the game. However, this is not necessarily the case. For

Game End and Victory

187

example, in Race for the Galaxy, the game can end several ways, one of which
is by a player getting seven cards into their tableau. But the player who does
this does not necessarily win. Winning is determined by other means than
the game ending.
As there is no reason to end the game if you’re not going to win, this
type of trigger can lead to over-analysis. For this reason, designs that can
be triggered by a player action often include hidden points or bonuses that
can make it difficult to judge who is leading. Another design technique that
can be considered is giving a bonus for triggering the end of the game, to
incentivize players to take that action. This mechanism can be found in
Concordia and Azul and is often a factor used to balance issues like players
getting an equal number of turns, but some players knowing that the game
will end when they take their final turn and others now knowing it. See our
discussion of End-Game Bonuses (VIC-06).

Fixed Number of Events

Description
The game ends after an event occurs a specified number of times.

Discussion
The Fixed Number of Events mechanism is most closely associated with card
decks. A number of special trigger cards are shuffled into the deck. When the
last of these is turned up, the game will end.
Airlines implements this system by mixing five Score cards into the stock
deck. Each time a Score card is turned up, an intermediate scoring will occur.
The last Score card initiates Final Scoring and the end of the game.
A similar system is used in High Society but is not directly tied to scoring.
Instead, four special Red cards are inserted into the Auction deck, along with
11 Yellow cards. When the fourth Red card is turned up, the game ends.
This system can add a lot of variability and tension to a game, as players
know approximately when it will end, but not exactly. A possible downside of
this system is that the special cards may all happen very early in the game, or
very late, which creates long stretches with no scoring. It is possible in High
Society for the four Red cards to be the first four cards turned over!
To combat this, many games that incorporate this mechanism use an initial
deck construction method to ensure that the special cards are reasonably well

Game End and Victory

189

distributed. The Expanse, for example, has the players divide the deck up into
three piles, and shuffle two Scoring cards into each section. This ensures
a somewhat even distribution, without the players knowing exactly when
Scoring cards will be turned up.
Get the Goods controls the distribution by shuffling ten Scoring cards
into the deck, with scoring happening when the 4th, 7th, and 10th cards
are turned up. This allows tension to build as Scoring cards are turned up,
while still giving a high probability of a reasonable spread of Scoring cards
throughout the deck.
This mechanism does not require card decks. In Pandemic, players lose if
there are a certain number of Outbreaks. Players track these on a chart on
the board.

Elapsed Real Time

Description
The game ends after a set amount of actual time has elapsed.

Discussion
Games with the Elapsed Real Time mechanism have an overall timer that
is independent of the actions the players are taking. The key advantage is, of
course, that players know exactly how long the game will take, which helps
them schedule and plan. Also, having a timer naturally adds an element of
tension to the game.
The exact implementation of the timer varies. While some older games,
like Escape from Colditz, had players set any timer they had around the house,
or simply check a clock, most modern implementations use some electronic
means. The Omega Virus has the timer built into the taunting computer in the
center of the board, which gleefully tells the players as time runs out. Break the
Safe has a digital countdown timer, evoking many heist films. Atmosfear had
players play a videotape to time the game. Escape: The Curse of the Temple and
Space Alert have an external soundtrack that is played, that provides ambient
sound effects as well as advising the countdown.
Electronic voices and soundtracks also have the advantage of being able to
incorporate mid-game instructions for players.
Escape Room games, like the Exit: The Game series, also rely on elapsed
time, typically tracked by a smart phone.
This mechanism needs extra attention when used in competitive games.
The possibility that players may stall when winning, to run out the clock,
needs to be addressed. This was a weakness in Escape from Colditz, a onevs.-many game (see “STR-03, Team-Based Games” in Chapter 1), where

Game End and Victory

191

one player controlled the German guards trying to prevent the Prisoner Of
War (POW) players from escaping. In the original version of the game, the
German players had a strong incentive to stall and take as long as possible to
make their moves.
The Omega Virus tackles this issue by having an “everyone loses” condition
if time runs out, turning it into a semi-co-op (STR-05). Another option is to
have simultaneous play, which disincentivizes players from stalling.

Connections

Description
The game ends when a specified number of connections are made on the
board.

Discussion
The Connections mechanism can be both an end-game trigger and a means
of victory. It is related to the Race mechanism (VIC-07).
In basic Connection games, like Twixt, it serves as the measure of victory.
The first player to connect opposite sides of the board ends the game and
determines the victor. TransAmerica is won by the first player to connect all
of their cities into a single network.
There are many games, however, that end based on connections, but in
which connections don’t ensure victory. The most prominent example are the
Crayon Rails series, which started with Empire Builder. In Empire Builder,
players build rail networks. The game ends when a single player connects a
certain number of major cities together in their network, as well as passes a
certain threshold of cash. Both conditions are required for game-end and
victory.
Connection can also be used as a sub-game. In Android, players try to
create connections between different groups, which give in-game benefits.
In the 18xx and Age of Steam series, players place hexagonal tiles that have
tracks printed on them onto the board in different configurations. Cable Car
does the same with square tiles. Placing those tiles enables players to create

Game End and Victory

193

routes between stations allowing for delivery of goods and earning money.
Typically, these routes are shared by all players.
Connection games need to deal with several topology issues. Can players
cross the paths of other players? Games that do not permit it, like Twixt, often
become static and have an optimal strategy. It is more typical to allow players
to cross or even parallel other players’ connections by paying a penalty or
increasing resource cost to do so, and/or by requiring a special tile.

Circuit Breaker/Sudden Death

Description
The game has a fixed and known victory condition, and a special variable
condition that ends the game prematurely.

Discussion
Sudden Death conditions can be used for two purposes. First, they can help
end a game once one player is far in front, out of the reach of the other
players. This is referred to as a Circuit Breaker, and is commonly seen in war
games. For example, in Rise and Decline of the Third Reich and The Russian
Campaign, if one player controls a certain number of key locations, they win
immediately. In Twilight Struggle, if one player reaches 20 Victory Points
(VPs) on the Tug-of-War style Victory Point track (VIC-19), then the game
immediately ends.
The Circuit Breaker is good for ending a lopsided game, leading to a more
positive play experience (or at least a shorter one!) for the losing side. Playing
out an obviously lost game is typically not a fun experience.
This mechanism can also be used to add an alternate way for players to
pursue victory. In Liberté, the game normally ends after all faction blocks have
been placed. However, there are two special conditions that players can try to
meet (Radical Landslide and Counter-revolution) to win immediately. Space
Base includes a card that says “You Win.” If a player manages to complete

Game End and Victory

195

the task shown on the card, the game ends immediately and they win. This
technique can be used to open different strategic options for players, or to give
players that are behind the chance for a Hail Mary attempt to win the game.
When they happen, they can be exciting and memorable victories.
Most of the loss conditions for Cooperative Games are also Sudden Death.
This adds to the puzzle that the players need to solve to reach a successful
conclusion.
Somewhat related, Hearts has an alternate condition that adds a fun twist.
Players normally gain 1 point for each heart they take, and 13 points for the
queen of spades (points being bad). But if a player takes all the hearts and the
queen of spades, they force each opponent to take 26 points. This mechanism
works especially well, as it turns what is normally bad into something great.
