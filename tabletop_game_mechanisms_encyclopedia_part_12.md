that only one move is programmed, as opposed to the 3–5 that are common
in traditional Programmed Movement games. These systems also typically
do not have a board or spaces to regulate movement but are played directly
on a table top. While this introduces some of the analog issues discussed

Movement

in Measurement, the use of the templates keeps things better constrained.
However, rules for collisions also need to be developed.
The use of templates also allows for unit differentiation by defining which
templates may be available to them.
Lazer Ryderz introduces a variation on the system by incorporating an
Action Retrieval system (ACT-03) for when players are allowed to reuse
certain templates.
A related system, included here for brevity, is Diskwars, where the units are
discs. They are moved by flipping a certain number of times. The diameter
of the disc and the number of times it may be flipped define the speed. In
essence, the discs themselves are serving as the Movement Templates.

Pieces as Map

Description
The Pieces themselves compose the Map.

Discussion
These games blur the line between Units and Map, as the map is composed
of the individual units themselves. Because of this, these games are typically
played directly on the table surface without a board.
The two exemplar games for this mechanism, Hive and Vortex, use
hexagonal tiles for units. Hexagons are a natural choice for this mechanism,
as it gives more options for pieces to move.
Typically pieces must be adjacent to other pieces, so there is one single
connected block of units. Pieces are added to the other edge, or moved around
the outside. Pieces that are surrounded by others are usually locked in place,
with only those on the outside of the block able to reposition.
Units may have intrinsic abilities (as in Hive) or gain special abilities based
on adjacent tiles (Vortex).
Because all the pieces, both friendly and enemy, are in a connected block,
these games are typically highly interactive, tactical, and quick.

Multiple Maps

Description
The game takes place on Multiple Maps which are connected at defined
points.

Discussion
This mechanism is implemented in Iron Dragon, a rail game set in a fantasy
world. Trains may run through the main board, or transition to a special
Underground map. The two are connected at specific points, which can make
for interesting route building.
Khronos has multiple boards, but these are connected in time rather than
space. They represent three different ages of the same region, and actions that
are taken on older boards, like building structures, can ripple through into
the future boards.
Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is a trading game that may be played by up to
15 players on three maps placed at separate places in the room. Each board is
played individually—turns are not synced between boards—and players may
move from board to board under certain circumstances, taking their goods
with them in an attempt to make better deals. When arriving at a new board,
they are inserted into the turn order. Players move around each map visiting
individual stores for buying and selling, and prices fluctuate independently.
Having Multiple Maps forces players to approach the geometry of the
situation in a different way. It may present shortcuts or advantages that need

to be evaluated in the context of the cost to take advantage of them. It also
allows the designers to create more complex structures.

Shortcuts

Description
A shorter or quicker route exists that may not always be available.

Discussion
Shortcuts are a way for designers to warp the geometry of the board, to
give players other options. For example, in Clue, players may move directly
between the diagonal corners of the board. This system reduces travel time,
which is not a core feature of Clue.
Sometimes, shortcuts are only usable by certain characters, or with certain
equipment. This is commonly used in dungeon-crawl type games, through
the Secret Passage trope. Characters may need to use a skill to detect and be
able to use them or need a special key.
Some games will have alternate paths that are shorter, but more treacherous.
This is a way to present tactical options to players in what is traditionally a
basic Roll and Move format (MOV-02).

Hidden Movement

Description
Movement occurs that is not visible to all players.

Discussion
Hidden Movement is closely tied to many of the mechanisms discussed
in Chapter 6, “Uncertainty,” but there are specific considerations that are
reviewed here.
Scotland Yard is a classic example of a game with Hidden Movement.
One player, Mr. X, is trying to evade the other players for a set number of
turns. Hidden Movement games require the hidden players to track their
location somehow, and in Scotland Yard it is done by recording it on a pad.
This method is commonly used in these games, as it also allows for the
players to review the hidden players’ locations after the game is complete,
both for the fun of seeing “close calls” as well as ensuring that the rules
were followed.
This last item deserves to be emphasized. By its nature, Hidden Movement
requires actions to be taken without knowledge of the other players. So,
typically the rules relating to this activity should be as simple as possible.
In Scotland Yard, Mr. X uses Point-to-Point movement, (discussed in
Tessellation MOV-01) to move around the map, using different forms of
transportation. The connections between the points are color-coded to
match the transportation options, making it relatively simple to understand,

398

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

and hopefully avoid mistakes. An error in a Hidden Movement game often
cannot be found until after the game is over and can invalidate the entire
experience.
There are games that have more complex movement and rules in general
in order to support a specific play experience. The Normandy Campaign is the
first entry in the Double Blind trilogy. In these war games, each player has
a map of the play area, and keeps it hidden from the other behind a screen.
The front line is represented by a chain of tokens. Any movement of pieces
behind the front line (friendly territory) is not revealed to the other player.
If a player wishes to move into enemy territory, they announce the numbers
of the spaces they moving into, one at a time. If there are enemy forces in a
space, the movement is stopped, and combat is resolved. Then the front line
is adjusted, as spaces that are moved through transfer ownership. This series
obviously requires that both players be very familiar with the rules and uses
an honor system for following rules.
The game Flat Top simulates carrier battles in World War II, and both
players use Hidden Movement on private boards to track the location of their
naval task forces to try to find the enemy players launch search planes on
the main board. However, since simply placing search planes launched from
carriers directly onto the board would reveal the carrier locations, players are
allowed to use Hidden Movement for search planes until they want to reveal
them on the main board. They can’t search until they are revealed, but they
can move to a different location far enough from their carrier to try to mislead
the opponent about their origin point.
Since deception and deduction are typically part of the Hidden Movement
experience, most of these games have defined points or reasons when players
must reveal their location. Scotland Yard requires the player to surface on
certain turns. Specter Ops requires the hidden player to commit crimes at
certain locations, which reveal their location, as does moving in Line of Sight
of a hunter (ARC-08).
Another option for giving hints is used in Captain Sonar. In this game,
each team announces what direction it is moving in (e.g., North or West).
The other team records this information, and since subs cannot move through
islands or off the map, can gradually figure out where the opponent is located.
The Fury of Dracula gives time-delayed hints to the hunters using an Action
Queue system (ACT-06). Dracula plays a card showing the location he is
moving to, but that card is added to a queue. Only the last card in the queue
may be looked at by the hunters, so they see where Dracula was a few turns
ago, but not where he currently is. This has the benefit of not requiring any

Movement

399

note-taking by the player conducting the Hidden Movement and helps detect
rule violations.
Pyramid of Pengqueen offers a unique approach to detecting hidden
locations. Players place magnetized pieces on either side of a vertical center
wall. When two pieces are on the same space, they repel and fall off of the
wall.
Another way to implement Hidden Movement is what we call the Anchor/
Distance mechanism. In this, the unit that is moving is revealed in a specific
location. Then each turn, or as a result of an action, it moves one further
away from that space, increasing the Distance. However, the exact location
is not recorded or determined in any way. At some point, the movement is
completed or the unit is revealed. At that time, it is placed on the map a
number of spaces away from the Anchor space determined by the Distance.
This system is used by War of the Ring. The Fellowship hides, and then each
time it takes a Move action the Distance is increased by one on a movement
track. The opponent (Sauron) may try to hunt and reveal the location of the
Fellowship, or the Fellowship may declare its position voluntarily. When it
is revealed, the Fellowship figure is moved on the map from its last known
location to any space that is the Distance away from the starting location.
The specific movement of the Fellowship must them be traced, and if the
Fellowship traces its path through certain regions, like an enemy-controlled
stronghold, consequences like taking increased corruption or damage will
follow. In other words, on a turn-by-turn basis, the Fellowship’s exact
location is undetermined. Interactions with the Fellowship are tied to its last
known location, but an interaction which reveals the Fellowship also forces a
declaration of its last few turns of movement. One important consequence of
this system is that paper tracking of the Fellowship is not required, and the
experience is far less susceptible to human error.
In 4000 ad fleets move by “warping” from one location to another. This is
done by placing them into a plastic tray and recording where it starts. Then
each turn it is advanced along the distance track, until the player decides to
leave warp. At this point, the fleet may be placed anywhere that is the current
distance from the origin.

Area Control

ӶӶ
Wargaming is a thread that runs through much of boardgame design, and
indeed, modeling conflicts through games remains a popular genre. At the
center of games of conflict is the notion of controlling an area.
How a game represents this idea is tied to the overall scope of the conflict
depicted. Theater-level games that deal with continents and countries tend to
be more binary and abstract about control, while individual and squad-level
games may not even define it, though the force-projection capabilities of units
will nonetheless enforce control over different parts of the board.
Area control games are more common in the American design school,
but over time, European designers have brought indirect conflict and rapid
resolution concepts into the space.
The term area majority is sometimes used in place of area control, and
another term, area influence, is also used. There isn’t a reliable definition for
any of these terms. But here’s one way to think of them: Area Influence is the
highest-level category, which would cover all types of relationships between
players, their tokens, and the specific areas they inhabit. Area Majority and
Area Control would be two sub-branches of Area Influence. In practice,
however, Area Majority and Area Control are the dominant mechanical
forms we observe in games, and the distinction between the two is often
ignored. Thus, we’ve chosen the name Area Control to stand for all the various
mechanisms of control and influence that we’ll discuss.
Many of the mechanisms discussed here are a subset of Chapter 10,
“Movement.” However their use is specialized and common enough to
warrant a chapter of their own.

Absolute Control

Description
One player has Absolute Control of an area.

Discussion
Absolute Control games, which are frequently referred to as Area Control
games, have territories with a binary character: controlled by a single player,
or uncontrolled. Controlled territories typically only contain one player’s
units, and other players are barred from co-existing in that territory. This
type of control can be seen in Risk, where attempting to move into enemyoccupied territories triggers a battle. This is as distinct from games like Chess
or Onitama, where a piece might project force across other spaces, but can
never protect the space it occupies itself, and is simply captured when another
piece enters its space. This is further distinct from games in which multiple
factions can share a territory without triggering a confrontation, like Root.
This observation leads us to another element of area more generally,
which is that it’s important to know who controls the space, because the
space occupied provides benefits, gives access to certain abilities, or produces
resources. The reason to occupy the space is not simply tactical and positional.
In Axis & Allies, spaces produce industrial production credits that can be used
to buy new units. In Small World, territories may have different features like
hills or mines, which may trigger specific effects or abilities, including bonus
scoring.

Area Control

403

Many games allow players to control a territory even though they have
evacuated the units within it. Typically these are marked with a “control
token” or something similar to indicate ownership of the area, like Axis &
Allies. However, some games, like Diplomacy, do not do this, but rely on the
players to remember which spaces are controlled. In Diplomacy this is not
much of a hardship because control only matters to special Supply Center
spaces, and there are few of those. The last player to control a non-Supply
Center space has no impact on the game.
Another consideration is how areas change control. The most common is
occupation by units. However, some games allow control to transfer without
units, such as through diplomacy actions in Pax Britannica and Divine Right.
In the latter, neutral countries (composed of many spaces) may be persuaded
to join a player’s side, in which case all the areas pass to the control of that
player. Similarly they can revert to neutral status or control of another player.
Diplomacy only allows Supply Centers to change control every second turn,
which gives players more time and space to maneuver.

Area Majority/Influence

Description
Multiple players may occupy a space and gain benefits based on their
proportional presence in the space.

Discussion
An elegant example of European design sensibilities applied to American-style
conflict games is the area majority mechanism of El Grande. Each province
is worth a different number of Victory Points (VPs) that will be awarded to
the player with the most caballeros (soldiers) present in the province. Points
are also awarded to the players with the 2nd- and 3rd-most caballeros in the
region. Caballeros do not directly interact, and there is no conflict resolution
mechanism of any kind. Instead, the game implements a Multiple-Lot
simultaneous Auction (AUC-11) themed as a conflict game. The game is
not won with tactical brilliance or a lucky streak of die-rolling, but through
efficiency in winning auctions for VPs.
This idea of efficiency is clearer in an even older game from the late
nineteenth century, Reversi. In Reversi, both players will, in turn, play 32
double-sided tokens to the board, flipping tokens of their opponent’s color
when they lie in an orthogonal or diagonal line between the newly placed
token and one or more anchoring tokens. The game is only scored after all
tokens are laid down, with the player controlling the majority of the 64 spaces
on the board being the victor. One could similarly envision Go as an area

Area Control

405

majority game, though it is strategically more of an area Enclosure game
(RES-12).
In Twilight Struggle, players must not only have a majority of influence
in a country in order to obtain control, they must have an edge over their
opponent equal to the country’s stability number. Stable countries with
dependable governments, like Japan, have a stability number of 4, while wartorn, weaker nations who were pawns in the global contest, like Lebanon,
have a stability number of 1. Controlling a country grants a few benefits,
including doubling the cost of your opponent adding influence to the country
through normal operations. However, being on the short end of that influence
battle isn’t all bad. As long as you had presence in the country, you could
spread influence to adjacent countries. This is a good example of how different
levels of presence and domination of an area can offer different tactical and
strategic advantages.
The notable distinction of Area Majority games is that troops of opposing
factions can co-exist in the same territory. In Inis, not only can opposing
clansmen co-exist in the same space, there is even a victory condition which
calls for sharing spaces with factions in six different territories. Relatedly, the
combat mechanism of Inis allows for players to participate in a round or two
of combat, and then mutually agree to stop fighting, without withdrawing
any troops.
Civilization also allows for units from multiple players to co-exist in the
same space, as long as the total number of tokens does not exceed the food
value. If it does, conflict occurs, but there is ample opportunity for peaceful
co-occupation. Unlike Twilight Struggle and El Grande, there is no inherent
benefit from having more tokens in a space in Civilization, unless combat
breaks out. But it can serve as a base from which to expand.
While some games allow a fluidity to the states of control a territory may
exhibit, other games have moments where control must crystallize, and
resolve in some way. While turn-based approaches are common, in which
scoring happens at the end of the round, or at the end of some specific rounds,
other games tie triggering resolution to the size of the forces present in the
territory. In Smash Up, each base has a trigger number. Once the sum of
forces played to that base equals or exceeds the trigger number, the base is
scored. Similarly, in Retreat to Darkmoor, the legendary hero attacks a line of
fleeing villains when the sum of the threat values of the villains breaches the
hero’s stability number. In Darkmoor, only those villains surviving the hero’s
attack are placed in the haven, whose victory points they will score based on
majorities at game-end. For more on this topic see Chapter 4, “Resolution.”

It is worth noting that in a standard Area Majority game, where rewards
are granted based on the ownership of a space, ties need to be considered by
the designer. Some games use “friendly” ties, where all players tied for first, for
example, receive first-place points. Other use “unfriendly” ties, where players
tied for first are awarded second-place points. Other tie-breaking mechanisms
(RES-18) are possible, such as priority tokens, or simply not allowing players
to create a tie.

Troop Types

Description
To compete for or establish control requires troops, inhabitants, influence,
presence, or some similar metaphor for being in a place. Many games have
a variety of unit types, with different abilities, and sometimes, different
implications for area control.

Discussion
In some games, only certain units can exercise control over a territory. Axis
& Allies requires infantry or armor units to take control of a territory away
from an opponent. Fighter and bomber planes may not even land on newly
captured territory, which can create some interesting decisions for players who
are forced to decide between taking a valuable plane as a casualty of combat in
order to capture a territory, or having the more expendable infantry unit take
the hit, but be left with a plane that is unable to conquer the space. In Kemet,
the powerful monsters and creatures summoned by the power tiles are not
considered units, and cannot even remain on the board if their accompanying
troops are eliminated.
In the context of area majority games, the simplest distinction between
unit types is their power. Some units have a strength of one, others are more
powerful. Dominant Species has both a majority contest, based on total
population of a species, as well as a dominance contest, which is calculated
by evaluating the types of food a species can eat and the quantity of that food
that is available in the hex being scored. A single unit may lose the population
battle, but win the dominance battle. A more straightforward application of
the idea of varying troop strengths is in Belfort, in which Elves and Dwarves

408

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

start at a strength of one, but can be promoted to count for two points of
strength.
The idea of different unit types is another foundational concept in game
design. It is both so old that it’s hard to know where it first began, and is still a
regular feature of modern design. Units can vary in their movement abilities,
combat strength, cost, their ability to perform certain tasks or even to be
placed in certain spaces, and more. Whether we’re dealing with space operas,
like Twilight Imperium and Star Wars: Rebellion or the highly simplified
wargame-like system Command & Colors, we observe a broad variety of unity
types and methods for distinguishing them from one another.
In the context of absolute control, some differences in troop types are tied
to the uncertainty engine that resolves combat. Whether troops roll a die to
hit, or can only be hit by a certain die value, or all the other variations on this
core idea (Chapter 4, “Resolution”), the differences between troops are about
how they influence random outcomes. This is one of the means by which
designers moderate the impacts of output randomness. The types of troops
committed, and the expected value they generate in terms of hits they can
inflict on the opposing side, represent a wager, with the value of the territory
occupied representing the pot to be won.
In an area majority context, there is a narrower range of variation. There
are troops that are worth more than one point of strength, troops whose
value is hidden, troops who can override rules that restrict additional troops
from being added, or troops that provide tie-breaker benefits. Rarely, a unit
might actually eliminate existing units from an opposing player, as the
T-Rex, and Pterodactyl units do in Triassic Terror. In that same game, the
Raptor unit also forces opponents to move units to another territory. Cave
Troll is built entirely around the mechanism of special powers for units
that influence the struggle for majorities in various rooms of a dungeon.
Each player fields units that have abilities such as locking down a room in
the dungeon to prevent other players from adding units there, or swapping
units between rooms. In Glenn Drover’s Empires: Galactic Rebellion (which
is only the latest iteration of a game once published under the Age of Empires
license) a variety of units perform functions either related to, or entirely
additive to, their roles in the majority contest. A Diplomat will let you
bring another unit along to a planet to increase your strength there, while
a Smuggler will let you get trade goods.

Territories and Regions

Description
Maps can exhibit hierarchical relationships among their constituent spaces,
such that a territory might exist in a region, and various attributes and
parameters may be tied to the control of these areas.

Discussion
The concept of Regions constituted out of a number of Territories is common
in conflict games. One typical mechanism provides an additional reward to
players who control a set of Regions that compose a territory. This mechanism,
a kind of territorial Set Collection (Chapter 12) can be implemented based
on absolute control, like Risk, or based on majority control, as in EightMinute Empire: Legends or Twilight Struggle. Setting regional control offers
some natural hooks for designers to hang additional concepts off of. Making
movement between Regions more difficult or expensive enhances defensibility
of a region, once it has been taken. Factions can be assigned “homeland”
benefits when in their own Regions too, as in Risk Legacy. In essence,
regionalizing Territories provides another dimension by which to differentiate
Territories, much as terrain does.
Regional effects provide opportunities to bring a setting to life by providing
narrative and mechanical events that differentiate the Territories from one
another. For Intellectual-Property (IP)-based games like War of the Ring,
regional parameters ensure that iconic moments in the original story can
be recreated with greater fidelity. Strider can only be revealed as Aragorn

Area Control

411

and crowned king if he reaches Minas Tirith or Dol Amoroth. Similarly,
the Corsairs of Umbar can only attack their historically hated enemies,
Gondor, and cannot simply sail to any coastal region. 1960: The Making of
the President’s card-driven system helps the Nixon player carry the West and
the Kennedy player, the Northeast. The contest is decided mostly in the South
and Midwest. Though deviations are possible, the core identity and patterns
of the 1960 election are reinforced by providing different regional strengths
to the Kennedy and Nixon players, baked into the makeup of their unique
decks.

Area Parameters

Description
In Area control games, Parameters are assigned to regions that impact why
players might wish to control them and how they need to allocate resources
to do so.

Discussion
The most common Area Parameters are the rewards gained for controlling
areas. Those could be VPs, which are awarded to the majority owner in El
Grande, or to a single owner in King of Tokyo. Other common rewards include
resources, like in Nexus Ops, and access to special powers, like in Alien Frontiers.
As previously discussed, access to adjacent territories can also be considered a
special ability. Exploration games like The 7th Continent and dungeon crawlers
like Descent: Journeys in the Dark will pile on a variety of parameters onto the
tiles that make up their game boards—though admittedly, this is stretching
the notion of area control extremely thin, particularly in a co-op context.
Memoir ’44 has various bonuses and penalties for attacking and defending
in and out of certain types of terrain, as well as rules modifying movement
for units moving through terrain. It is a good example of the flexibility of
assigning Area Parameters.
Carcassonne extends the notion of Area Parameters by assigning parameters
to different features on each tile. These parameters include point value, and
rules for when and how they can be scored. Though we don’t typically think
of Carcassonne as an area control game, or even a bidding game, both of those

Area Control

413

ideas find expression in its game engine. Placing a pawn takes control, and
represents a wager on the overall value of that feature when (and if!) it finally
scores.
Another important Area Parameter is unit limits. These limits, sometimes
called stacking limits because they defined how many counters could be
stacked on top of one another in hex-and-counter wargames, establish a limit
to the size of armies. Sometimes these limitations are global, as in Heroes
of Land, Air & Sea, which has a 5-unit limit on territories. Other times,
the stacking limit is expressed as a matter of control limits: in Conquest of
the Empire, a general can lead a legion of up to 7 units. Some limits are
enforced based on terrain and unit type. The most common examples are
that naval vessels can’t enter land spaces, and conversely, land units can’t enter
sea spaces. Advanced Squad Leader and other wargames often assign units a
“stacking value,” and each space can hold a maximum stacking total, which
sometimes varies by terrain. Mountainous terrain often restricts mechanized
unit movement, as in Memoir ’44 where only infantry can move through
mountains, but artillery can be emplaced on mountains at setup.
Line of sight is another Area Parameter, but one that is more connected
to how units interact with one another across multiple areas, rather than
being the quality of an area being occupied. We will address it below in the
following section on Force Projection.

Force Projection

Description
Force Projection is the impact of the movement, attack, and other abilities of
units on the decision-making of your opponent.

Discussion
Much of area control revolves around how units can claim and possess areas.
However, achieving that control is a matter of how the various abilities and
powers of units are arrayed and used in combination. Chess is a good example:
in Chess, units occupy their own spaces, but the only relevant parameters tied
to that are that pawn movement into the space is blocked, and bishop, rook,
and queen units are blocked from passing through those spaces, and must
end their movements on capture. Where units are positioned in Chess matters
much for where they project force. A bishop, knight and rook may, from three
different places on the board, train a withering triple attack on an opposing
pawn. Similarly, a powerful queen piece might be harassed and forced off
into a corner because all the spaces she could land on are being threatened by
other units. Famously, a knight against the edge of the board can be corralled
by a bishop in a position exactly three spaces away, orthogonally. In such a
position, every space the knight may move to is threatened by the bishop.
Force projection as a mechanism is strongly tied to Movement (Chapter 10).

Area Control

Onitama uses Force Projection almost exclusively. In each game, five random
movement patterns are in play, and cards rotate in and out of the possession
of the players. Skilled players will be able to look ahead several moves and
predict the unfolding of the game board based on where units project force.
Many capture-based abstract games exhibit this quality, from Checkers and
Chess to Elementos to Hive. Photosynthesis has a unique implementation of this
mechanism. Trees don’t project force the way a spearman might. Rather, they
project force based on the size of shadow that they cast. As the sun rotates
around the board, a tall tree will shadow others around it, preventing them
from generating light points for their owners.
Force Projection is not uniquely related to area majority/control games.
Enclosure games like Blokus exhibit this pattern, and auction games have a
similar feeling in the way that each player’s remaining money is a potential
threat in every succeeding auction. The analogy between auctions and area
majority games continues to resonate in this context as well. Force projection
as we use it here is a spatial mechanism. The number of spaces an army can
move, the range of an archer, the area of effect of a wizard’s spell, or a sniper’s
line of sight mechanisms are what we’d call Force Projection mechanisms.

Zone of Control

Description
Spaces adjacent to a unit impact the ability of opposing units to move or
attack.

Discussion
The Zone of Control (ZOC) has been a staple of conflict games since the
1960s. It allows the designer to reduce the unit density and to still allow
players to form lines with gaps that enemies cannot simply move through
without consequence. It is a type of Force Projection (ARC-06), as it allows
a unit to impact other areas of the board.
In the basic ZOC, units must stop when moving adjacent to enemy units,
and are required to attack. Typically all opposing units that are in a ZOC
must be attacked, which can lead to one unit having to attack more than one
opposing piece.
This type of ZOC is sometimes called a Hard ZOC. There are also Soft
ZOCs, where pieces may continue moving after they enter the ZOC but
have to expend more Movement Points (MOV-04). In some games, this is
not permitted, but units that begin in a ZOC may leave the enemy ZOC by

Area Control

417

moving to a non-ZOC space, or may move directly from one ZOC to another,
but must immediately stop.
Some games only assign ZOCs to certain types of units, such as Cavalry
or Skirmishes, or deny it to units in a certain state, like Napoleonic units in
a Square, or unsupplied units.
ZOC can also be created more organically by allowing units to take
opportunity attacks against units that move adjacent to them, or past them,
or that begin a move next to them but move away. While not a ZOC in the
classic sense, it does impose consequences for moving units, and will shape
the battlefield.

Line of Sight

Description
Units may only see certain areas.

Discussion
Many tactical games need to determine if a unit can see another, typically
for purposes of attacking. This is referred to as Line of Sight (LOS). A
variety of mechanisms have been developed to deal with this situation,
with different degrees of accuracy and complexity. LOS is a type of Force
Projection (ARC-06) in that it controls which areas of the board a unit
may impact.
The simplest LOS mechanism is to have a range of a certain number of
spaces, and to trace the shortest path of spaces (hexes or squares, typically) to
the target. If there is any terrain that blocks LOS, the firing unit cannot see
the target. PanzerBlitz uses this method.
There are almost always multiple ways to trace paths from attacker to
target, so typically the attackers may choose which path they prefer. While
this has the benefit of simplicity, it also makes for some unusual situations,
particularly on square grids. Its use is typically restricted to hex grids.

Area Control

419

Games such as Advanced Squad Leader increase realism by having players
lay a thread between the attacker and defender hexes. Dots are placed at
the center of each hex to assist in this. If the thread touches any obstacles
that block LOS, like buildings or forests, the LOS is blocked. The increased
accuracy of this method comes at the cost of fiddliness in terms of moving
pieces out of the way, and adds the possibility of arguments, as the LOS may
just graze certain obstacles and it isn’t totally clear if it is blocked or not.
These systems need to deal with elevation changes as well, to account for
hills, gullies, and multilevel buildings. All of these add both complexity and
realism. Most games use a “layer cake” approach, with pieces being able to
see all spaces on the same elevation as them, and can only see lower levels if
they are on the edge of their elevation (a “crest” hex). Some games even add
rules for blind spots behind obstacles for observers at a height.
In Nuns on the Run, players are trying to avoid the nuns patrolling the
grounds. Movement is Point-to-Point (MOV-01), and LOS is determined by
placing a straight edge between the two points and seeing if it hits any walls.
As a help to players, the spaces are numbered, and the rules include a table
showing if two spaces (looked up by number) can see each other or not. Nuns
on the Run also has facing. Nuns can only see 180 degrees in front of them.
Other games like Advanced Squad Leader do not have facing.
Miniatures games often use a “model’s eye” view to LOS. Players lean
down to the table, and check to see if they can see the opposing models.
Laser pointers can be helpful here in making a determination. Yet, as with
the thread method, this can often lead to player arguments. There may also
need to be judgement about whether some elements of the model don’t count
for LOS. Warhammer Age of Sigmar, for example, specifies that decorative
elements added to a model like flowing capes and large crowns are not valid
for LOS. This allows players to exercise their creativity when painting and
decorating models. Warmachine/Hordes sidesteps this by having players use
standard cylinders to represent models when checking for LOS.
The tactical battle game Tannhäuser takes a simplified approach to LOS.
Spaces on the board are color-coded and grouped into “paths.” Characters on
the same path (same colored circles) can see each other. Some spaces between
paths have two different colors—to represent that they can be seen from any
space in either path.
LOS is a bedeviling aspect of game design. High-level conflict games don’t
require these rules at all, but squad-level combat games usually do, and these
games often have some area control aspects to them. LOS usually interferes
with force projection, so blocking LOS is a tool in the designer’s toolkit for

modifying the way in which certain units shape the battlefield and the options
players have for navigating it.

Set Collection

ӶӶ
Humans are pattern-seeking creatures, which perhaps explains why so many
games incorporate some version of set collection. There’s a nearly endless
variety of types of sets to collect. Some sets are thematic, like Noah’s pairs of
animals, or the Three Little Pigs. Some are abstract, like Poker hands or melds
in Gin Rummy, and some sets are arbitrary, like the compass, tablet and gear
science cards in 7 Wonders. Even game concepts like contracts or tickets
can be considered types of set. But no matter their variety and underlying
commonality, all sets are built on the idea of synergy: the value or power of
the set is greater than the sum of its parts.
The result of this characteristic of sets is that as players collect the
components of a set, they will naturally diverge in their valuation of the
remaining components. Picking up the fifth dumpling in Sushi Go! means
much more than the first tempura—but for another player, that tempura
completes their set and scores five points, while the first dumpling is worth
only a single point. This value difference means that inter-player competition is
no longer zero-sum. Players can set and achieve goals that are not in diametric
opposition to their opponents, and the indirect conflicts that result engender
a less aggressive dynamic that can appeal to players who may shy away from
direct conflict.
Set collection can readily support multiple dimensions, and this is
common to all but the simplest of games. Number-based sets can be collected
in numerical order, or in multiples of a single number. Add in colors or suits
for yet another dimension. These orthogonal dimensions create choices and
tension, as players consider which types of suits to collect based on their value,
distribution of their components, and what their opponents might be trying
to collect.
421

422

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

The rich math behind set collection makes it a great tool for designers,
but just as important for its popularity is the thematic consonance and
intuitiveness of set collection. In Ticket to Ride there’s no imaginable reason
why, at least from a simulation perspective, a set of four blue train cards can
connect Chicago to Omaha, and also Helena to Winnipeg, but not Winnipeg
to Duluth, or Dallas to El Paso. Surely, the actual inputs of labor, capital and
raw materials are similar, and it’s hard to think why, in practice, the blue
tracks are any different from the green ones. And yet, through set collection,
these issues present no challenge to players, their understanding of the game,
and their willingness to accept its conceits. Some tracks are green, and some
are blue. Game on.
That’s the real magic of set collection. It is an incredibly versatile mechanism
for abstracting a whole host of possible game activities. Sometimes, these sets
feel richly thematic and representative of the activities being simulated, and
other times the sets are merely a veneer. But our human love of patterns
and combinations means we’ll accept quite a bit of abstraction in our set
collection. Coupling this activity with clever scoring and collection dynamics
and you have one of the fundamental building blocks of boardgame design.
While set collection can be implemented with many different kinds of
components, by far the most common components are cards and tiles. For
the sake of simplicity, we will refer to set elements generically as cards, unless
referring to a specific game that uses some other component.

Set Valuation

Description
Set Valuation is the logic or underlying mathematical model by which
designers assign values to sets of game elements. Set Valuation can be in
terms of currency, resources, or victory points.

Discussion
To paraphrase Jerry Seinfeld, it’s one thing to collect the set, but something else
entirely to value the set. Many other chapters in this book, like “Economics”
(Chapter 7), “Auctions” (Chapter 8), and “Card Mechanisms” (Chapter 13),
discuss how resources are allocated and acquired, but in this section we’ll
discuss what those resources are actually worth. Implicit in this framing is
that sets are nearly always converted into some benefit and consumed, turned
in, or otherwise removed from play, even if only at game-end. Sets are not
typically semi-persistent: either you make them and spend or score them right

424

Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design

away, or they persist and are scores at game-end. However, some sets may be
held, and scored when a player chooses to do so for maximal effect.
In the introduction to this chapter, we described sets as being worth more
than the sum of their parts. A more precise way to say that is that sets do not
increase in value in a linear fashion. However, there are many shapes that
the value curve can take, and each of these shapes will incentivize different
behaviors.
The simplest valuation is that set elements are worth nothing on their own,
but the set, when completed, has a value. Ticket to Ride, and its traditional
forebear, Rummy, value sets in this fashion. A card may fit into more than
one set, but on its own it has only potential value—and often, it may be a
wasting asset too. In Ticket to Ride, routes will get claimed over time, and
cards of matching colors therefore decline in their utility. In Rummy, cards left
in your hand at game-end typically count against your score or contribute to
your opponent’s score, depending on the specific variant. This scoring system
creates something of a push-your-luck dynamic as to when to cash in a set
for a reward, and when to hold cards to attempt to increase the set size and
payout.
A less-punishing valuation provides that singleton cards have some basic
value of their own. Cards may also have unequal values, so that there are
more valuable and less valuable cards. Sushi Go! has some cards that are worth
points on their own, but are worth more in a set, like the nigiri cards that have
a point value that can be tripled when paired with a wasabi card.
Another aspect of Set Valuation is termination. Some games define sets
strictly as some number of elements, after which the set terminates. Catan
defines sets in this fashion: you need one wood and one clay to build a road.
No further cards fit into the set in any way, though another set of wood and
clay can build another road segment. Other games offer escalating sets that
terminate, so they have a minimum and maximum valid size, with different
payouts based on the size of the set. A similar mechanism is found In Ethnos,
where bands—sets of the same creatures—are awarded points and allow
markers to be placed on the board for area control (Chapter 11). Bands of six
or more all score the same amount, no matter how large they get, but larger
bands still gain their full on-board placement benefits. In 7 Wonders, there is
no maximum set size or set score for science cards of the same type, beyond
the maximum number of science icons of the same type in the deck.
When sets have a maximum size and/or score, players are incentivized to
diversify and collect multiple types of sets. When sets are not limited, players
are wiser to specialize. However, these base dynamics can be influenced

Set Collection

425

both by the specific valuation curve, and the existence of orthogonal sets.
7 Wonders science scoring is a great example. In 7 Wonders, there are three
types of science cards: tablets, compasses and gears. Cards of the same type
score the number of matching cards raised to the power of two, which is a
sharply accelerating scoring curve that incentivizes collecting only one kind of
science. However, the orthogonal set—that is, one of each type of science—
offers a counter-balance. A set of three compass cards is worth nine points
(three to the power of two), but a set of one of each science type is worth a
base of 1 point per card, and a set bonus of seven, for a total of ten points—
actually outscoring the geometrically increasing set of the same size. Only
when the monotype set has four cards does it begin to outscore diversity sets,
sixteen points to thirteen. Players leaning into a science strategy should seek to
specialize, but the most efficient scoring for three cards is a diversity set. These
varying incentives create interesting decisions and behavior patterns at the
table—even aside from all the other types of sets and scoring in 7 Wonders.
When sets can increase in size and value, a designer can use a variety
of progressions to score increasingly larger sets. We had discussed squaring,
which is one common progression that accelerates sharply, and is most useful
either for smaller sets, or for creating a shoot-the-moon or push-your-luck
dynamic, where a single large set can overwhelm other scoring strategies.
However, designers have overwhelmingly opted for a different sequence when
trying to preserve greater balance among options: triangular numbers.
The triangular sequence, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, etc. has achieved nearly the
status of a mantra or a koan among game designers. It is featured in an
enormous number of games and proves incredibly versatile at providing
escalating rewards for larger sets without overly incentivizing specialization
to the exclusion of all other strategies. Triangular scoring also has a strongly
intuitive property, which is that the second member of the set increases your
marginal score by two points, the third increases that score by three, and so
forth. If you’re playing a game with triangular scoring and you’re wondering
how many additional points you’ll score by adding the nth card to your set,
the answer is n.
Not all scoring progressions slope up. Terminating sets are the most extreme
