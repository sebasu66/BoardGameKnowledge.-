Feel free to write this number on the card with the Sharpie if it helps you remember.
2. Deal each player a hand of five cards from numbered deck.
3. Red suits (diamond and hearts) are negative valued. Black suits (spades and clubs)
are positive valued.
4. By adding and subtracting their card’s values, players are trying to get a hand that is
closest to the number—­without going over—­on the trump card played in that color.
(For example, if a black Jack card is in play, all players are trying to get a hand that
totals 12 points.)
5. The player with the number closest without going over in that color wins. (In the case
of the trump being a black Jack card, if the closest hand is a black 10, then that player
wins. A black 13 would not.)
6. However, a player may win the hand if they match the number in the opposite color.
(For example, if one player has a black 10, but another has a red 12, then the
red 12 wins.)
7. The dealer then selects one of their face cards and places it face up in the center of
the table.
8. The value of the card is the target number for the players. The suit of the card is also
the trump suit.
9. Players may choose to discard up to five cards and are dealt new cards to replace
them.
10. All players reveal their hands. If there is a tie, the player with the most cards in their
hand that matches the suit of the trump card, wins the card’s value in points.
11. Repeat play until all players have been the dealer twice. The player with the most points
at the end of the game wins!

Step 3: Play Test the Game
Play the game using the rules from step 2.
Once you’ve played it, you’ll notice that this game is fun but could be better. The first problem is the dealer has the most control over the game since they determine what the trump
card is. Giving a player that big an advantage is unfair to the other players.

145

Some of this advantage gets mitigated by letting each player be the dealer, but what’s keeping
each player from always playing the highest point card (the King)? If there is only one clear
choice, then there is no choice. Let’s change that. How do we do that?
We change the rules.

Step 4: Change the Rules
Here’s a suggested rule change. Instead of the dealer revealing the trump card on the first
turn, the trump card is revealed before cards are dealt out to the players. Play test this rule
and see how it changed the game.
When I changed when the trump card appeared:

What’s another rule that you would change? Write it down here:
My new rule is:


Step 5: Change a Number
Change a number in the game. It can be the number of cards a player is dealt (perhaps three
or four cards instead of five cards), it can be the number of points on the face card
(18-­19-­20-­21), or it can be the number of hands played. Go ahead and change a number.
The number I changed was:

What happened when I changed a number:


Step 6: Change the Objective
Another way to change the game is to change the objective. What if the goal was to get a
hand that was higher than the number on the face card? Then the player with the highest

CHAPTER 5

L e t ’ s M a k e a C ard G am e !

numbered hand wins. However, you could still have the exact number in the other color
trump because you always want a way to win even if you are “losing” the game. It just makes
things more exciting, and it lets the player feel like they have a chance to win even when
things aren’t going in their favor.
How did it feel when you made this change to rules? Did you like it better or worse than the
original game play?
I liked it (circle one): Better Worse

Step 7: Add a Mechanism
As you have already seen, there are so many card game mechanisms to choose from! Let’s
pick something from that big list earlier in the chapter.
I’m going to add the mechanism of betting. To add betting to a game, you need to add
something to bet with. You can use coins, tokens, candies, or whatever. Just make sure each
player has enough of the item. (If a player bets 1 coin per round, they should have a minimum of 5 objects per round—­which is about 25 objects per player or 100 objects for
four players.)
I’m going to add a rule that players can bet on their hand before all cards are shown. If
their hand wins, they earn double the points for that hand. This “commitment bid” can be
used only once a game by a player—­that way we need only a few of these tokens (one
per player).
Go ahead and play test the game with your new mechanism. How did the play test go with
your new mechanism? Write the results here.
The mechanism I picked is:

Go ahead and rewrite your rules using this new mechanism. How did it change the game
play? Did it affect the objective of the game?
The mechanism I picked changed the game in this way:

Step 8: Change the Theme
I find that plain ol’ playing cards can be dull-­looking, mainly because we’re so used to how
they look. Let’s spice things up with a theme. Since everyone is competing to get the same
card in the middle of the table, what if we were all playing as thieves trying to steal a
valuable gem?

Here’s where you can take those stickers and use them to cover the front of the face card. If
you feel like it, you can draw a picture of a gem (or a treasure chest or a statue or whatever
you like) on it. Or you can just write the word “GEM” on it instead. Make sure that you
include the target number (remember? King = 13, etc.) on the face of the card too.
My card game’s theme is:

You can make your game any theme! When I play tested this game design, my play testers
suggested the following themes:
■■
■■
■■
■■

A Tug of war
A person jogging a distance through a park
Feeding a baby dragon (the number on the cards was the food you feed it)
Goldilocks trying to find the “right” bed

Go ahead and write up the rules to your new themed card game here:

Let’s Share a Card Game!
Now that you’ve created our card game, share it with the world! Making a small print run of
card games used to be difficult and expensive, but it was often the only way a designer could
get their game into the marketplace! Merle Robbins, the designer of Uno, sold his game out
of his barbershop before it was licensed by International Games. Fortunately, it is much easier and cheaper to print a deck of cards these days!
Getting your game out into the world is an important step in becoming a professional game
designer. After all, games are meant to be played, so don’t be afraid to share your design with
the world! We’ve already talked about making a physical deck of cards, so let’s learn about
making a digital file so you can share your game!
To share your game, do the following:
1. Create the file digitally. Depending on how you want the printer to create it, you can
create each image either individually or in a nine-­card format as we talked about earlier.

149

150

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

2. Name layers individually. When making your digital file, make sure to name layers
individually. It’s quite easy to lose track of which layer is which!
3. Decide on the number of files. A choice you will have to make is whether you want
to have a single digital file for each card during production or have a “template” file in
which you construct each card. Even though it takes up more space on your hard drive,
I recommend the former. It makes it easier to make individual card changes and
save the file.
4. Some designers like using NANdeck, which can be found at www.nandeck.com.
NANdeck is a Windows-­based program that supposedly makes it quick and easy for
designers to create card decks. I’ve tried it myself and don’t care for it, but your mileage may vary.
5. Don’t forget the backs! Depending on how you prepare your cards, you will need
either a nine-­card sheet of card backs or the card back as a separate file.
6. Save your digital files. By the way, you will want to save your digital files as JPEG or
PNG files for printing purposes. Some publishers require your cards to be in PDF format (a pain in the butt, in my humble opinion) or as a TIFF.
7. Once you have all your files, compress them into a file such as ZIP format.
Don’t forget to include the name and version number of your game in your filename,
and don’t forget to include the rules or any notes on how your cards should
be printed.
8. Upload your file to the Internet for everyone to download! Share your new
card game with a friend or family member or post it on Board Game Geek to share with
the entire gaming community.
Congratulations! You are now a published game designer.

10 Card Games to Play
The best way to get better at designing games is to keep playing them. Here is a list of great

basic sets and starter guides available. There are many formats to play as well as a digital version, not to mention hundreds of websites and podcasts about the game. If you
get hooked, be prepared to spend money!
Dominion (2008)—­The first game of the deck-­builder genre, Dominion has expanded
into almost a dozen expansion sets. There’s a digital version too! While an “oldie,” it’s
still worth playing to understand deck-­builder basics.
Parade (2007)—­Avoid collecting cards and try not to earn points in this charming
Alice in Wonderland–themed game.
Guillotine (1998)—­Manipulate the line of royal cards that lead to the guillotine to gain
the most points when they are executed.
Uno (1971)—­Try to be the first player to discard your hand of cards in this classic
game. I always recommend that my students play Uno because it is a great example of
how to make a fast, casual card game. If you want to spice things up, you can use my
own house rules: 7s makes players pass their hand to the left; 0s makes all players pass
their cards to the left.
The Mind (2017)—­Without verbally communicating, players attempt to play their
cards in numeric order. Don’t be deceived by its simplicity—­The Mind swept up all the
awards in 2018.
Sushi Go (2013)—­This is a card game completely built around the mechanism of drafting
cards. Players pass cards around as they attempt to gain points and build matching sets
of cards. The “dumpling scoring mechanism” is one of my favorites in all of card gaming.

L e t ’s Ma ke a Par t y Game
WOOT WOOT! WHO wants to party?!? Then let’s make a party game!

But what exactly is a party game? It seems like almost any style of game can be considered a
party game. Guessing what a barely decipherable drawing is supposed to be? That’s a party
game! Trying to trick your friends into believing that you aren’t going to betray them? That’s
a party game! Making Grandma read two completely unassociated dirty phrases just to
embarrass everyone at the table? That’s the most popular party game in the last decade!

First Came Parlor Games
What is now called party games first evolved from parlor games, which were popular in the
17th and 18th centuries. Parlor games were played primarily in parlors (well, duh) by the

154

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

middle and upper classes who found themselves with increased leisure time thanks to
industrialization.
Many of these parlor games were originally outdoor games that were adapted for inside play
like Blind Man’s Bluff, Hunt the Thimble, and Are You There, Moriarty?
As more people started to become educated, games were invented that embraced wordplay
and wit such as The Minister’s Cat, AesoPs Mission, and Wink Murder. Perhaps you’ve played
some of these classic games. If so, enter your favorite here:
My favorite parlor game is: _________________________________________

Then Came Party Games
In America, somewhere between the 1870s and 1930s, parlor games fell out of favor. There
are a few theories for why this happened. First, with the rise and fall of prohibition, adult
parties focused on drinking and other. . . adult activities. Erudite games were out, and more
casual games like gambling were in! Another contributor was the rise of radio. Why think
when you can just passively listen? Movies, organized sports, and other distractions also
took players out of the parlors and into theaters, stadiums, and speakeasies.
Another reason might be architectural. Around the 1930s, architects replaced the once ubiquitous parlor with a new location in the house: the family room. These larger rooms became
the social hub of the house and a room designed for social events such as parties. With more
social events, a rise in more “mature” card games such as Bridge, Hearts, Gin Rummy, Cribbage,
and Poker were seen. You know—­the games your grandparents like to play.
A few family-­friendlier versions of these card games popped up during this time like Skip-­Bo
(1967) and Uno (1971), but for the most part, the more childish games that had been traditionally played in parlors were left for the kids to play elsewhere.
In the 1980s two games made a big splash in American social circles. The first was Trivial
Pursuit (1981)—­a trivia-­based game that catered specifically to the Baby Boomer generation.
Trivial Pursuit became so popular that adults would host parties centered around the
new craze.

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

The second was the How to Host a Murder series (1985)—­the precursor to live-­action, role
playing (LARPing) that combined a Cluedo-­style murder mystery, role-­playing complete with
costumes, and a dinner party. Trivial Pursuit and How to Host a Murder spawned a multitude
of imitators. Soon the market was flooded with these types of games.
Two other games rose to prominence during this period: Mafia (1986), a crime-­themed
social deduction game that had immigrated from Russia to college campuses around the
world, and Apples to Apples (1999), which first became extremely popular at church camps
thanks to it winning the National Parenting Seal of Approval award. Personally, I wasn’t
aware of these games at the time; I was too busy playing “adult” party games like Beer Pong
and Quarters. What can I say? It was the 80s and I was in college.
These and other party games persisted during this time with popular mass-­market titles such
as Jenga (1983), A Question of Scruples (1984), Cranium (1998), Moods (2000), and The Game
of Things (2002) being published by the “big boys” Hasbro, Milton Bradley, and Parker Bros.,
but they were mostly being sold to “kids and families” at retailers like Toys “R” Us.

155

156

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

Mafia evolved into the game Werewolf (1986), which inspired dozens of social deduction
party games including The Resistance (2009), Coup (2012), One Night Ultimate Werewolf
(2014), Secret Hitler (2016), and We’re Doomed! (2019).
After a period of cooldown, the party game genre skyrocketed with success of two card games
on Kickstarter: Cards Against Humanity (2009) and Exploding Kittens (2015).
Cards Against Humanity is an outrageous and uncensored version of Apples to Apples that first
found popularity as a print-­and-­play game and went on to become a Kickstarter hit. As of
this writing, the game is earning $40 to $50 million a year!
Exploding Kittens (2015), a card-­game version of Russian Roulette, earned $1,333,586 on its
first day and ended up selling more than 2.5 million decks for an estimated $50 million
in revenue.
Both games inspired a slew of imitators as party card games became more “adult” in theme
and content. Some of the more notable (or is that shameful?) games include Drunk Ass
(2013), Mobscenity (2013), Drunk, Stoned or Stupid: A Party Game (2014), F**K the Game
(2015), That’s What She Said (2016), and Cards Against Sobriety (2016).

The party game genre shows no signs of slowing down. Codenames (2015), What Do You
Meme (2016), Unstable Unicorns (2017), Just One (2018), and Wavelength (2019) are all worth
playing at your next game night.

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

There Are Only Four Types of Party Games
As I was designing my own party game, I took a hard look at all the other successful party
games on the market. I wanted to understand how they were similar and how they were different from each other. While they all used different mechanisms, I found that, in general,
there are only four ways players interacted with the game in relationship to each other. They
are what I call “One In, One Out,” “One In, Many Out,” “Many In, One Out,” and “Many In,
Many Out.”

One In, One Out interactions are in games where the active player takes one action such as
asking one question, miming something, or drawing a picture. The other players try to provide one (the correct) answer. These are primarily trivia-­centric party games like Trivial
Pursuit: Genus Edition (1981), Cranium (1998), Colourbrain (2017), and Blockbuster (2019).
You are either right or wrong in these games with there being no wiggle room for the answering player. However, while these trivia games are still popular in the mass market, they are
considered antiquated by the hobby gamer, who prefers to have more choices in their games.
One In, Many Out is used to describe games where the player has many choices of an
answer such as The Minster’s Cat or Wits and Wagers (2005). In the Minster’s Cat, the player

157

158

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

can answer with any word provided it starts with the correct letter of the alphabet and hasn’t
been used by a previous player.
A One In, Many Out game might allow players to narrow down their guess over a series of
rounds. This style is much more appealing to players than One In, One Out because it’s more
forgiving. It’s even better if you can find a way to visually represent the “band” of options like
the play board in Wits and Wagers, the lineup of cards in Timeline or the dial in Wavelength.

Codenames (2015) is another example in which the clue-­giver can tell the other players they
have several choices available. It is up to the player to determine which are the correct ones.

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

One In, Many Out can also be used to describe the number of choices the player has on their
turn. For example, in Twister, while the player has no choice which limb they must place
(hand or foot), they might have several choices based on their position on the mat and/or the
length of their limbs.
Many In, One Out is where players have a variety of ways to get players to give a single
answer—­whether it’s drawing, acting, saying multiple words, or even sculpting! Charades,
Pictionary (1985), The Game of Things (2002), Taboo (1989), Cranium (1998), Moods (2000),
and Pantone the Game (2018) are prime examples of this type of interaction.

I like this style of party game because they often give the active player an opportunity to
show off their creativity, talent, or wit. However, some players are intimidated by this. I tried
to address this in my own game, Pantone the Game, by having the players “draw” with colored
cards so they could use “I can’t draw” as an excuse for not playing the game.
This type of party game often utilizes timers to help reign in the artist or actor and create
some tension for both the clue giver and the guessers.
Many In, Many Out is where the clue giver has lots of choices or ways to express themselves, and there are lots of ways for the other players to interpret the clue. Apples to Apples

(1999), Dixit (2008), Cards Against Humanity (2009), Mysterium (2015), and What Do You
Meme? (2016) are much more free-­form and often require a judge or moderator to come to
a decision pertaining to the player’s guesses.
When starting to design your own party game, consider which of these interactions is the
right one for the game you want to make. Go ahead and write it down here:
The interaction of my party game design is:
____________________________________________________________________

Traits of a Party Game
Now that we’ve looked at how to allow the players to interact with the game, let’s look at the
traits found in party games. Often game designers are asked “How do you begin designing
your game? Do you start with a theme or a mechanic?” I have found that when creating a
party game, you can start with an activity.

Take, for example, the game Throw Throw Burrito (2019). The designer’s goal was to re-­create
the game of dodgeball but for indoor play. Other elements of the game, the cards, and when
to throw the soft foam burritos (because using real burritos would just get messy!) evolved as
the design progressed.
You’ve learned where a party game comes from, but what is a party game? Let’s look at the
defining traits of party games. Remember, not all party games have these traits, but the
majority of them do.

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

Trait 1: Keep It Simple
A party game is simple to learn. Designer Elan Lee likes to tell the story about how the
original rule book to Exploding Kittens fit on a single sheet of paper. The core rules to my own
game Pantone the Game can be explained in three sentences.
1. Select a character card.
2. Use color swatches to represent the character.
3. The other player guesses the character with as few hints as possible.
Designer Richard Garfield says that games have a complexity budget, and players of party
games have a lower complexity budget than, say, a strategy game. You should be able to
explain the rules as quickly as possible—­seconds, not minutes or hours. Partygoers don’t
want to wait around while someone explains the rules; they just want to play!
Don’t let the rules get in the way of the fun, and don’t let keeping score get in the way! The
fun is the main thing you should be concentrating on as a designer. If something is fun to do,
then make sure the players keep doing it!
A good test of the rules to your party game is how succinctly they can be told to the other
guests. If you can keep your rules short, you might have the makings of a good party game.

Trait 2: Few Components
Keeping things short means keeping things simple. This is why the second trait of a party
game is that they don’t use too many components (if any!). I’ve already talked about the
concept of handiness and how it can impact the play of your game. Think about it this way:
your party goers are too busy holding drinks and food to be holding too many components!
Make it simple for them to play your game and still enjoy the party.
Many party games use only cards such as Werewolf (1986) or Monikers (2015) or a cupful of
dice like Zombie Dice (2010) or Batman: The Animated Series Dice Game (2016). Twister (1966)
uses only a mat and a spinner, while The Minister’s Cat (circa 1800s) doesn’t use any components at all!

Trait 3: No Theme Required
Party games don’t require a story or theme. There are many party games that are considered “themeless”—­Charades (1550), Cards Against Humanity (2009), Salad Bowl (2004),
and Taboo (1989). These games emphasize players interacting with each other over trying to

161

162

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

tell a story. That’s not to say that there aren’t party games that utilize story—­Werewolf
(1986), Two Rooms and a Boom (2013), and How to Host a Murder (1985) come to mind—­but
often, a party game is based on a premise, rather than a story or theme. I’m using the term
premise how it is used in film theory. A premise is the initial situation that drives the plot. It’s
a “jumping off” point to get the viewers involved.
A great example of this in party games is Wavelength (2019). The premise is about a psychic
using a machine to guess what the other players are thinking, but whenever anyone describes
how to play the game, that premise is often ignored in favor of “you are trying to guess what
the other players are thinking.” And that’s okay.
Because I also design video games, I often think of the player’s relationship to a party game
in this way: a hobby or thematic game is like a third person video game where you are playing
a character like Batman or Lara Croft. You are invested in their story and their world.
By contrast, a party game is like a first-­person game where the player is “you.” It doesn’t matter what the story is because the game is about the narrative you create—­the story of you
and your experience when interacting with the game.
A theme can get players initially interested in buying a party game, but I find that once the
game gets going, often the theme or story is jettisoned in favor of the pure gameplay.

Trait 4: Accommodating the Players
Party games can accommodate many players. You never know how many people will
show up to you party,1 but the more players there are at the party, the more rambunctious
and fun the game will be! Some party games require a minimum number of players. For
example, Werewolf needs at least eight players to work. Why is that? The answer is math!
Let’s look at the rules of the game and how the numbers impact the gameplay.
In Werewolf, some players are secretly werewolves, while the rest are villagers. There is a night
phase in which the Werewolves “hunt” a villager and “kill” them, removing them from the
game. Then there is a day phase in which the villagers must deduce which of the living players
is the werewolf who did the deed and vote to eliminate them. The goal is for the villagers to
deduce the identity of and eliminate all the werewolves and for the werewolves to eliminate
all the villagers. Let’s see why this game requires at least eight players to play.

In my experience, I’ve found that two-­thirds of the people you invite to a party don’t show up! Why is that? Don’t
they know that my parties are always fun!?

If one player is a werewolf and one player is a villager and the werewolf kills a villager during
the night phase, then that’s not much of a game, right? The game doesn’t even get started!

If there are two villagers and the werewolf kills one of the villagers during the night, it’s not
much of a mystery who the werewolf is. And besides, when it comes to voting on who is
going to be hung, there will be a tie.

You’d think that three villagers and one werewolf would allow for some obfuscation during
the voting round, but remember, one of those villagers is already dead and no matter whether
the werewolf is hung, or a villager is accidently hung, the game will be over at the end of that
round! Not much of a game if it’s over in one round (unless you are playing One Night
Ultimate Werewolf [2014], which does exactly that!)

Things start to get a bit spicier when you have five players (one werewolf and four villagers),
but it makes for a very short game if the werewolf is discovered in the first round. The same
is true when you have six or seven players. You usually want a game like this to last a minimum of four or five rounds.
The first round is for everyone to learn how to play the game. The second round is for players
to start to formulate a strategy and look for behaviors in the other players. Things don’t really
start to heat up in a game of Werewolf until the third round, and if you had only four villagers, the game would already be over! This is why the game’s rules suggest that there should be
a minimum of six villagers and two werewolves!

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

The addition of the second werewolf makes things more interesting for the werewolves, who
must silently agree on their victim during the night phase, and exciting for the villagers, who,
even if they manage to find and eliminate one werewolf player, still must find another one,
which they might not have as much luck doing!

The last big twist in the game Werewolf is the addition of special characters who each possess
a special ability. The fortune teller can silently guess the identity of a player during the night
phase. The lovers try to protect each other from getting hung by the villagers, because if one
dies, the other dies out of heartbreak. The lycan turns into a werewolf if “killed” by one. And,
if the hunter is killed, they get to “shoot” one other player as a last gasp!
I am the Werewolf (circle one):

YES!

NO!

Ultimate Werewolf: Ultimate Edition (2008) has dozens of these special character roles in the
game. Despite all these unique roles, most players find that Werewolf isn’t that complicated
to play because players are learning these roles and their special abilities one at a time. This is
a great way to introduce new gameplay mechanisms into your own game design.
Even with all these players and all these extra rules and exceptions, an average game of
Werewolf can take around 60 minutes to play, which is another trait of party games. They
are quick to play and promote repeat play. Often, my friends will want to play two or
three games of Werewolf a night, rather than just one.
One of the best signs you can get from players of your game design is when they want to
immediately play it again. If that happens, you know that you are on to something good!
If you don’t know how many players your game should accommodate, I use the rule of thumb
of a minimum of four players. I think of it this way: One person isn’t a party. Two people isn’t

165

166

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

a party. Three people might be a party, but a party doesn’t really start until there are four or
more people. If you want to accommodate even more players, consider having players
form teams.
For example, you can play Pantone the Game with up to 20 players, but once you get past
10 players, I recommend breaking up into teams. If your design is flexible, there’s no top
limit to how many players can play at once. I’ve heard of games of Werewolf with more than
100 players!

Trait 5: Playable Anywhere
Another trait of party games is that they can be played (almost) anywhere. Parties can
happen anywhere such as a house, at a campsite, on a ship, or even in a bus. And a party
game should be flexible enough to be played anywhere too!
This flexibility is a good thing to test during the development of your game. Don’t just play
your game in your living room or your classroom. Try playing your game in a coffee shop or
(if you’re old enough) a bar. Try playing it outdoors or at a crowded party. Try playing it on a
camping trip or in a moving vehicle like a train or a bus. If the players laugh and yell even
with all the distractions and bumps and whatnot going on around you, that’s a sign that you
have a successful party game!2
That’s not to say that all party games should be played anywhere. Some games like Codenames
or Beer Pong or Jenga require a table or flat surface to play on.
Try using the “world” as part of your game design. Games like Two Rooms and a Boom (2013),
This House is Haunted (2014), Monikers (2015), and Speakeasy (2015) either encourage or
require players to move throughout multiple rooms of a house during play.
Other games like Pin the Tail on the Donkey (1887), Twister, and Don’t Step on It! (2017) come
with a play mat on which the game is played. Just because you are creating a party game
2

Just don’t play your game in a library or church or some other place where you might get “shushed!”

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

doesn’t mean you have to adhere to a single concept of a party game. Make your players play
the game the way that you want it to be played.

Trait 6: Interruptions Allowed
There are some things about a party that you just can’t control—­and that’s the people. Party
games should reflect the nature of a party—­groups form and break up, people leave, new
people show up, get snacks, take a break, etc. There’s nothing you can do about this as a
designer, except to allow your game to be interrupted by the players.
This is where party games are different from all other types of games in that the “magic circle” we talked about early is much more flexible in a party game. A player can leave a game of
Pictionary or The Game of Things or Taboo or Scruples, and it won’t make too big a difference to
the play of the game or its outcome.

You can accommodate this challenge by focusing the game on a moderator player with the
rest of the players forming a loose structure. For example, in Cards Against Humanity, one
player is “Card Czar,” a judge who asks the questions and reads the player’s responses. Even if
a player gets too grossed out by the other player’s answers and leaves the game, you can still
play. . .provided that not too many players leave the game.
The rules and goals of your game should be flexible for the game not to “break,” even if a
player or two leaves the game. Don’t let the rules get in the way of the fun. And don’t
let keeping score get in the way either. Players play party games to have fun. Winning and

167

168

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

scoring points is often secondary to watching your friends acting goofy or saying something
awkward or silly. It doesn’t matter who wins, as long as they had fun.
Some party games can be played for as long as the players want. Trivia games (like Trivial
Pursuit—­played without the board) or games where player’s response is judged (like Apples to
Apples or Cards Against Humanity) often end either when the players become tired of playing
the game or when the novelty of the game wears off. This isn’t the most desired way to end a
game as it tends to fatigue players and they might not be so quick to replay your game again
in the future.

Trait 7: Scoring at a Party
You could also end your party game when your players reach a predetermined score.
However, I find keeping individual score during a party game to be. . .a bit of a drag. Sure,
there are some games that have players track points by holding on to cards they have successfully answered or earned through judging, but I believe that the feeling of success is more
important to the player than keeping score.3
To avoid the problem of the “endless game,” consider creating a natural stopping point or
ending to your game. For example, the game could end once every player has had a chance to
have a turn to be the judge/moderator/card czar. Or you could end the game once all players
have been eliminated. The game could end after a predetermined number of rounds.4 It’s
more important to leave your players wanting more than have them get burned out on
your game.

Trait 8: Ageless
The last trait is that most party games can (mostly) be played by people of all ages.
Party games are often the “first point of contact” for younger players. If we want more players
to get into the tabletop hobby, then party games are the best way to start them off.
Another way to look at it is this: if your game is playable by people of all ages, then people of
all ages will play your game. More important, more people of all ages will buy your game.
Keep in mind that just because a game is a party game, that doesn’t mean that it’s for children. There are some party games that children should never play due to things such as the
subject matter or the inappropriate language on the cards. It is up to us adults to determine

3
Keeping score often works better when the players of a game are divided into teams. Team-­based play by its very
nature fosters a greater spirit of competition.
4
How many rounds is just enough? I always start by using the magic number three. The best answer to “When
should the game end?” is “Right before it gets boring.”

whether a game is appropriate or not for the younger players at the party. Take responsibility,
party people.

The Five Ps of Party Games
Hmm. We still haven’t answered the question “What is a party game?” A standard definition
is “a type of game played at social gatherings to facilitate interaction and provide entertainment and recreation.” Hmm. That’s a bit too clinical for my taste.
My friend, game designer Gil Hova, defines a party game as “a game that involves repeatedly
performing a simple and rewarding social interaction.” Repeatedly is one of the important
factors; social is the other.5
My own definition of a party game is “A game in which several players or teams interact using
social, knowledge, dexterity, or communication skills.”
Regardless of your definition of a party game, I believe that every party game’s design utilizes
what I call the “five Ps.”

Permission
Most party games are “social experiences in a box” that allow you to express yourself in ways
that you normally wouldn’t in polite company. You can act silly, sexy, scary, or strange. You
can let your imagination and creativity run wild. You can accuse other players of terrible
things and say terrible things about them—­all without the fear of judgment or scorn. The
magic circle of the party game provides a space for you to safely explore these things, allowing you to enjoy it and have fun with it.
However, some party games, like Cards Against Humanity, offer a deferment of responsibility. The game is essentially saying “It wasn’t me who thought up that filthy sentence; it
was the cards!” The danger with this is that there must be consent and buy-­in from all the
players. The game must provide a “safe area” for this type of behavior. If someone becomes

uncomfortable with the content or actions of a game, they should be able to opt out without
being questioned or embarrassed about it.
Another aspect of permission is the power of embarrassment. Twister, for example, uses
the embarrassment that you might feel about being in close or intimate contact with another
player to great effect. You might feel embarrassed about looking silly in front of others.
However, a big part of the fun of playing Twister is that feeling of embarrassment, which is
diminished because everyone playing is also feeling that embarrassment! The laughter that
arises from a game of Twister is just as much from embarrassment as it is from fun!
While embarrassment is a powerful tool that game designers can use in their game design,
you want to be careful of relying on it too much; it may drive a player away from playing your
game. Some partygoers might be keen to play Spin the Bottle (circa 1920) or Truth or Dare?
(1712), while others might dread the game but cave in to peer pressure.
If there is any chance that a player might feel uncomfortable during the game, then you
might want to consider the use of an X-­Card, a tool created by game designer John
Stavropoulos.6 The X-­Card is a physical card that you can pick up or point to at any time during the game to end an uncomfortable situation. All players agree to change the course of the
game if someone uses the X-­Card during a game. The X-­Card is most often used during role-­
playing games, but I could see where it might be useful during a party game.
Some gamers have issues with the X-­Card and prefer not to use it at all, citing that its presence invites using it unnecessarily. That it can cause disruption of the game. I believe that the
X-­Card is a tool that can be used well or poorly, just like any tool. In the end, if a problem
arises, it’s best to discuss and resolve the issue. No game system is a replacement for actual
compassion and conversation.

Predictability
I’ve already said that one of the most important things you can give gamers in your design is
variety, there is something to be said about the power of repetition.
Gamers often look for patterns in the game’s rules when trying to understand how to play a
game. Therefore, when you do the same thing (or similar actions) each turn, not only does it
allow you to take a quicker turn but it allows you to plan in-­between turns. The best part is
that once you understand these patterns, you can break them to create unique strategies and
take unpredictable turns.

You can find expanded notes about the X-­Card at highlevelgames.ca/blog/5-­reasons-­to-­use­the-­x-­card.

CHAPTER 6

L et ’ s M a k e a P a r ty G ame

Unpredictability, especially in party games, is great too! As a designer, creating situations
that create unpredictable results is fantastic, as this is often where the humor during the
game comes from. Unpredictability can come from a variety of sources—­from the surprise
of new information on a card to a guess based on your own knowledge, humor, or
experience—­something only you know or would have thought of. This randomness creates
surprise, which is just variety that you aren’t expecting!

The interesting thing is this randomness eventually can turn back around into repetitiveness—­
especially in games where running jokes can develop—­where you “call back” to something
funny you might have said or done earlier in the game. The classic game Salad Bowl7 strongly
relies on callback as communication becomes more and more limited over each consecutive
round of play.
As a designer, you want to capitalize on these unpredictable results and incorporate them
into your rules. The game Just One (2018) does this. If two or more players select the same
answer, those answers are cancelled out. This creates tension for both the active player (who
is worried that the same word will be selected by more than one player) and the other players
(who are worried that there will be fewer clues that help the active player guess the mystery
word). Within the magic circle of the game, that tension creates fun! Since all the players’
scores are tied to each other’s performance, everyone either benefits or fails.

Pace
When designing your party game, consider the pace in which it is played. A game can be
either fast ’n’ frantic or slow and thoughtful.

Fast ’n’ frantic games like Scattergories (1988), Taboo (1989), 5 Second Rule (2010), 20 Second
Showdown (2019), and Speed Charades (2019) are just a few party games that challenge you to
guess as many answers as possible within a short time. Part of the fun comes from the
embarrassment factor when someone panics in their rush to provide clues. These games usually come with sand or electronic timers, although you can keep track of the time using your
watch or phone. Just make sure to mention that in the rules.
While your game design might be slow and thoughtful, you still might want to enforce a time
limit on a player’s turn. If a turn drags on for too long, it will kill the momentum of the game.

Slow and thoughtful party games such as Codenames (2015), Dixit (2008), Pantone the Game
(2018), Concept (2013), and Spyfall (2014) require you to consider the clues. You must think
and analyze before giving answers. Wrong answers mean reducing points or forfeiting a turn.
Slow and thoughtful games often require you to act as a moderator or judge to determine
whether another player or team’s answer is correct. Sometimes you create the answer, while
other times it is found on a card or some other prompt. This is an important choice to make
as a game designer. Having your players create their own answers can slow down the pace of
a game. In the party game Cards Against Humanity, the game’s designers discovered the
length of the game shortened significantly when players used preprinted responses instead.
If your game design does require players to write down their own questions and answers,
don’t forget to include a pad of paper and a few pencils. Alternatively, you could provide dry-­
erase markers in the game like Just One and Telestrations do.

Presentation
As we have already seen, the lexicon of tabletop game design is filled with terms with multiple, often conflicting, definitions. Presentation is just one of them.
The presentation of a party game might refer to its premise, a loose story or theme that
helps you get into the mood of the game. For example, the game Mafia is about lawmen rooting out criminals, but that social deduction game can just as easily be about a village infested
with werewolves or witches, an artic base infected with a shape-­changing thing, or a spaceship carrying an unwanted alien passenger.
What I find fascinating is that while humans love stories, party games don’t have to be about
anything, other than the challenge presented to the players. What is the theme of Apples to
Apples, Just One, or Taboo? Who cares?! It only matters that we are having fun playing! Do
you want to give your party game a premise? Then great! It will help guide not only the players but the graphic design of your game.
You don’t have to be a graphic designer to design card and board games, but you do want to
have an idea of what the final version of your game might look like. Create a mood board
using Pinterest or even just a folder of images you’ve captured from Google Images that you
can use as inspiration for yourself and any artists that you hire to work on your game. If you
create a unique enough presentation, it could affect every game that comes after yours.

Take, for example, the distinctive black cards of Cards Against Humanity (CAH) with its stark
white Helvetica Neue 75 Bold font. That simple design choice influenced the visual design of
every party card game for the next 10 years.

173

174

YO U R T U R N ! T H E G U I DE TO G R E AT TA B L E TOP G A M E DE S IG N

CAH’s graphic designer, Amy Nicole Schwartz, talked about how the design came about: “The
design of Cards Against Humanity itself in a graphic design context isn’t groundbreaking.
But in a tabletop card game/party game context, it’s groundbreaking in its simplicity. The
visuals don’t get in the way of play. It’s a legible game—­you understand what you’re doing,
and a lot of other games are thrown together. They sometimes use cheesy graphics, sometimes the information hierarchy on a card doesn’t really aid in playability at all. The experience of playing the game was foremost in designing the product itself.”8
That information hierarchy Schwartz mentioned is an important aspect when you are
designing game components, especially in card games. The first aspect to address is “what
information is most important for your player to see?”

In the example of a Séance card, the most important information is the letter on the card.
Since the player scores points by spelling the word Séance, it should be the clearest thing to
read. Depending on your gameplay, you might want to make the card’s cost, attack, or victory
point value the largest thing in the graphic design.

You don’t have to always use size. Color, font, location, shape, scale, texture, or any of these
in combination will add visual interest to focus the player’s attention on the information.
Making this happen subconsciously for the player is better than not at all. Speaking of location, remember that we discussed card layout in Chapter 5, “Let’s Make a Card Game.” If
you’ve already forgotten it, go back and review it. Look at several card games to get ideas for
how you can lay out your cards. Find good and bad examples to help guide your decisions.

Props
Props are things that come with your game (or things that you have readily available in your
home) that you use to play your game. These can be some sort of toy or device to spice up
your game. If you were going to design a party game with a prop, what would it be?
My prop would be a: _________________________________________________
