media outlet. It was smooth sailing from that point. The military angle, it turned out, was
the easy part.
If you know some wargamers, or can spot those who could be (are analytic, practical and
good at turning the news into numbers), but aren’t, they are the ones who can make this happen. Unless you are the one, in which case you can get straight to work.

RANDOMNESS, PLAYER CHOICE, AND PLAYER EXPERIENCE
John Kaufeld

When people complain about boardgames, what do they complain about the most? Luck!
Many games at many tables around the world (but particularly in the United States) end
with a variation on the classic line, “If I just rolled a nine, I would have totally owned you in
that game! You can’t call that a ‘win.’ The dice just liked you better tonight.”
All games contain a certain balance between randomness and player choice, but different
levels of that balance appeal to different types of players. To be successful it in the market,
a game requires the right combination of features to appeal to its target audience. As long
as the game meets the needs of the intended audience, and does so in an entertaining and
engaging way, the game has a shot at success.
We see this idea demonstrated in the market with everything from simple, mass-production children’s games to high end European boardgames.
Bouncing into the Random World of Candyland
The classic children’s game Candyland, for example, is entirely based on chance. Player
skill has nothing to do with the outcome of the game.
After setting up the pieces and shuffling the deck of colored movement cards, players
simply flip over the top card of the deck, move their pieces, and wait to see which of them
will draw the right combination of colors to reach the finish line first.
Before the first player even drew a card, the game already selected the winner; it just
hasn’t told anyone the outcome yet. The act of “playing” the game reveals which player the
game selected. There is no decision-making, no strategy, and no player choice. If you substituted a dog, monkey, or pile of building blocks for one of the human players, the replacement
would still have exactly the same chance of winning as the human player did.

As a children’s game, though, this mechanic delivers a benefit for its audience. First, it’s
simple. It requires no reading, so young children can play. Because the board and cards are
color-coded, players can easily figure out where to move their pieces.
The mechanic also creates an interesting by-product: the ability to play the game alone.
By taking player choice completely out of the game and substituting a simple card-flipping
mechanic, the designer made Candyland into a completely functional activity for one young
player. A creative child can completely engage in a game “against” a couple of stuffed animals or other toys. She can entertain herself the whole time with imaginative commentary
as play goes on. Because the game gives entertainment value through this capability, the
game continues selling well today. By meeting a need for its audience and delivering value, a
game that completely ignores player choice and interaction becomes a viable, profit-making
product.
Peeking at the Realm of Pure Strategy
At the other end of the scale, we find pure strategy games. These games boil randomness
entirely out of gameplay, creating an experience that focuses on player choice, skill, and
interaction.
In games like Blokus, Quarto, Chess, and Go, players see the entire strategic situation laid
out in front of them. There is nothing hidden and nothing unknown, apart from the other
player’s strategic plans. Players use completely balanced groups of pieces against each other.
A player’s success or failure in the game relies entirely on his ability to plot out a solid
strategy and react to what his opponents do. No random event will suddenly appear out of
nowhere and turn the outcome of the game.
Cityscape adds a twist to the “pure strategy” concept by letting players set secret goals for
each row of buildings in their city. The goals add an element of surprise to the game’s outcome, although the playing style itself relies on pure strategy and player choice.
At the beginning of each round, players decide their goals for each section of the board,
and then record their choices by placing a standard 6-sided die into a scoring block. Only
they can see their goal dice during game play.
During a turn, players draw one block from a shared pool, and then place that block onto
one of the board’s sixteen spaces to build part of their city. Since the pool contains a limited
number of each size block, players sometimes find their choices limited. At the end of the
round, players lay their blocks down and show their choices to all players. Finally, all players
count their score.
Are these game designs somehow better because of their high strategy? Are games that
use a more random concept in their design automatically inferior? Again, you need to go
back to the experience of the player, because the player is the final judge on these questions.
Losing in a pure strategy game clearly, plainly, and somewhat painfully demonstrates
that a player made less successful choices than the winner. While that’s fun for highly competitive, thoughtful, strategic and serious players, not everyone shares that vision.
Tempering Strategy with Randomness (and Vice-Versa)
Many people look to games as a form of light mental challenge, relaxation, and a handy
excuse to get together with their friends. In those situations, most players look for an experience that mixes pure strategy with randomness, rewarding players who make good decisions, while giving people with lower skills a fighting chance for victory at the same time.
The vast majority of games on the market today fall into this broad category, although with
wildly different mixtures of their key ingredients.

Designing Tabletop Games

Even Eurogames known for their high strategy include some random elements to keep
the playing experience fresh and provide different challenges. In the highly-rated European
strategy games Power Grid and Puerto Rico, randomness touches the gameplay experience
like seasoning in a fine meal: you notice it and you know it’s there, but it only nudges the
game experience, not defines it.
Examining the Mix in Puerto Rico and Power Grid
The random element of Puerto Rico comes from the blind draws of plantation tiles during
each Settler round. Players need plantation tiles, along with matching production facilities,
to create goods that give them money and victory points in the game. Tiles representing
plantation fields for the five production crops come into the game in random order. This
limits player options and forces them to make the most of the available choices in any given
round.
Although the random element impacts each player’s strategy, it does not define that strategy. Players can still follow their own directions and make their own choices. For example, a
player might really want a coffee field this round, but if no coffee is available on their turn to
choose, they can shift their strategy a bit to make use of the many sugar fields that appeared
during the last draw, for example.
In Power Grid, randomness controls the supply of plants available for the power plant auctions. Players need plants to power the distribution grids they build in the game. Each plant
supplies power to a certain number of cities while using a specific type and amount of fuel
(powering up to three cities by burning two units of oil, for example). In addition, each power
plant card has an identification number which represents the opening bid to own the plant,
and figures into how players determine turn order. Those variables make each plant unique
in the game. This creates a lot of tension in the power plant auctions, because a plant’s value
depends on each player’s growth strategy, the quantity and type of fuels available, the type
of power plants owned by the other players, and how close players are to ending the game.
During setup, players pull nine “starter” power plants out of the deck, then shuffle the
remaining plants to create a randomized draw deck. Every game begins with the same eight
starter power plants in the auction supply. The ninth starter power plant card sits at the top
of the draw deck, waiting to enter play as the first new card drawn.
As players purchase power plants from the auction, they restock the auction supply with
replacement power plants drawn from the deck. Starting with the second draw, randomness
takes control of the power plant auction supply. After six to eight auctions, players clearly see
the effects of randomness in the game as the original plants disappear, replaced by progressively more efficient plants which randomly join the game.
But the designer did not completely leave random chance in charge of the auction supply.
The game’s auction system includes two mechanics that maintain the balance of power by
managing the availability of plants in the auction.
The first mechanic governs which plants players can purchase at auction. Of the eight
cards in the auction supply, only the four lowest-numbered plants are available for purchase.
Players can see the other four higher-numbered cards, but can’t bid on them yet. When a new
plant comes into the game from the draw deck, it goes into auction supply according to its
identification number. Depending on its number, the new plant might immediately be available for purchase or it might force a lower-numbered plant into the available for purchase
section.

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

The second mechanic works much more simply. At the end of each turn, the highestnumbered power plant in supply goes back to the bottom of the deck. Players immediately
draw another plant to replace it, using the regular restocking rules to position that plant in the
auction supply.
If a designer increases the random element in a game, she will often put the randomness inside some constraints to limit its impact. The constraints blunt the impact of random
chance, giving the players’ choices and strategy more power over the game’s outcome.
Can’t Stop Dealing with Dice in Settlers of Catan and Formula D
The much-vaunted Settlers of Catan uses two dice to drive resource production each turn.
Although dice are a common source of randomness in any game, Settlers constrains the randomness with a predetermined grid of production numbers placed on the board’s resource
tiles. The production numbers enforce a standard bell curve distribution on resource production.
Since the players can clearly see which tiles are more likely to produce goods, they can
make informed, strategic decisions about the placement of their settlements and roads in the
game. Their strategy drives those choices. The production numbers on the board serve as
extra information to help players guide their choices and achieve their strategy, but they also
constrain the impact of randomness on the game’s outcome.
The racing game Formula D (formerly known as Formula De) accomplishes the same thing
by using custom-numbered polyhedral dice. Each die in the game represents a different gear
in the car’s transmission. Although the dice are of standard polyhedral sizes ranging from
four-sided to thirty-sided, the numbers on each die use different ranges than normal.
For example, the first gear die is four-sided, but only displays the numbers one and two on
its faces. Likewise, the twenty-sided die that represents a car’s fifth gear only rolls numbers
ranging from eleven to twenty. The distribution of numbers in that range is exactly even, so
you stand the same chance of rolling an eleven as you do of getting a blazing twenty. The
custom dice protect you from complete chance because of their restricted range of numbers.
The classic Sid Sackson game Can’t Stop is entirely focused on rolling four standard sixsided dice, but it still gives players a lot of control over their success. This game constrains
randomness and improves player choice through its board layout and how players use the
die rolls on each turn.
The board is shaped like a classic stop sign, and displays a column of movement spaces
for each number in the range from two to twelve. The columns for two and twelve sit in the
shortest sections of the board, along the outside edges on each side. As you move toward the
middle, you find columns for each number. The columns are in order by the probability of
rolling that number on two six-sided dice. The center of the board belongs to the column for
the number seven, the most-rolled combination.
In the game, players roll four six-sided dice each turn. That takes care of the randomness
component, but what about player choice? Players set their strategy by splitting the four dice
into two pairs. The players put markers onto the board according to the pairs of numbers
they generated. Players can choose to lock in their score with the markers as they already
are, or they can take a chance and continue rolling. If they roll again, they must be able to
make one of the numbers from which they previously scored on two of their newly-rolled
dice, or they lose all of the points they scored this round.

Designing Tabletop Games

Because the players have complete control over how they pair the dice, they effectively
get to choose the probability of success on future rolls. If they feel lucky, they might choose a
low probability number like two or twelve, because the scoring tracks for those numbers are
much shorter than the tracks for higher probability numbers such as six, seven, and eight.
Regardless of the outcome, the players still get to make the decisions that drive their strategy
and the outcome of the game.
Is There a Single Right Answer?
There’s no “right” setting when it comes to the balance of randomness and player choice
in a game. Instead, it all depends on what the players enjoy and how the randomness elements fit into the greater design of the game.
The balance of randomness versus player choice in a game’s design dramatically affects
the player experience. Knowing your target players helps you refine the game experience to
meet their needs. The more a game entertains and challenges its players, the more players
your game will get. And that, after all, is the name of the game!

DICE AS DRAMATURGE
Chris Klug

“Well, I don’t know what to do, you tell me.” We were playing DragonQuest, an older penciland-paper RPG which I was helping develop for SPI. A good friend of mine was playing an
RPG for the first time ever that Sunday. He and I had forged our game-playing friendship
over Strat-O-Matic Baseball, a dice-and-cards centric baseball simulation, and he wanted to
try this ‘fantasy’ thing with me. He knew I designed games for a living, was willing to give
anything I was working on a try, but fantasy wasn’t normally his cup of tea.
This game session, however, was a particularly bad one to serve as his introduction to the
world of fantasy role-playing. The party had encountered a troll, the negotiations had gone
badly, one of the group had decided to take a swing at the ‘big ugly,’ and a couple of fumbles
on their part later, the only party member left standing was the character run by my newbie
friend, and all he was armed with was a dagger.
My friend (Todd by name) understood the dynamics of baseball sims; he understood
odds, and even though he didn’t quite know for sure what a ‘troll’ was, he had just seen it
wipe the floor with the other party members, and he also knew the character he played was
about as green a character as he was a player, it being the first game session for both player
and character. He tried to come up with a baseball metaphor to describe the situation his
character was facing, one that he and I would both understand.
“This is kinda like Koufax against Choo-Choo Coleman, right?” (Koufax is, of course,
Sandy Koufax, the all-time great Los Angeles Dodger lefty pitcher who mowed down batter
after batter during the 1960‘s, while Choo-Choo Coleman was a starting catcher on the 1962
Mets, they who still hold the all-time single season record for least wins as a team in a season. Coleman epitomized that team).

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

I thought for a second. “Well, while it may look that way, I think you have a better chance
to suceed than Coleman did.”
“That’s not saying much,” he whined a bit. Todd never liked to lose.
“In Strat,” I continued, “Koufax dominated lefties, and since Coleman batted lefty, he’d
have absolutely no chance of hitting a homer against Sandy.”
Todd looked glum. “Don’t I know it.”
“However, DragonQuest has a system that does allow you a chance, albeit a small one,” I
said.
“What’s that?” Todd looked up.
“We have a Critical Hit System. If you roll really, really well, you can do a hit that avoids
the troll’s natural armor and you can do a lot of damage,” I explained.
Todd brightened. “Well, that sounds like I should stay and fight this guy,” and he started
to shake the two D10s in his hand.
“Whoa,” I cautioned. “Before you choose to stand your ground, let me explain your
chances. First, you’re rolling D100.”
“You explained that already.” Did I mention Todd was impatient?
“Hang on. You need a 02 or less to do a Crit.”
“That doesn’t seem like much of a chance.”
“You are only a new character, remember?”
Todd just stared at me silently.
“Ok, so IF you roll an 02 or an 01, you do a Crit, which does max damage for that dagger.”
Todd thought a sec. “That still wouldn’t kill him, would it?”
“Nope.”
Todd was getting frustrated. “Well, so even if I do hit him with a Crit, then he’s gonna
take a swipe at me and I’ll end up like so much hamburger!”
I sighed. “More than likely.”
Another player, Steve, chimed in. “Wait, wouldn’t Todd then get a roll on the Critical Hit
Table?” That table was one of my favorite toys in DQ. In addition to just doing max damage
that avoided armor, when you generated a Crit, you rolled D100 and looked up a viscerally
descriptive additional result on this table. Most of the time, the table added flavor to the
result, such as “Your blade has caught in the target’s right elbow joint and been ripped from
your hand. You are now without your weapon but the target’s right arm is totally useless for
the remainder of the fight.” or “Your attack found a particularly vulnerable chink in your
opponent’s armor, the damage done from the blow is doubled.” Nasty stuff.
However, in addition to these descriptive results, some results were based on the type
of weapon used (crushing weapons might break a bone, stabbing weapons might injure an
internal organ) and these results were particularly effective but very rare.
“Let me see that,” Todd asked. He skimmed the table, skimming some of the more lurid
descriptions, and handed it back to Steve. “That seems pretty cool, let’s just have at it.”
“You sure?” I asked.
“Yup,” Todd replied. “And, after all, I can always just create another character, right?”
“Right,” I said. “Roll.”
Todd shook the two D10s in his hand. They were read sequentially, with the first die
(numbered one to zero) read as the ‘tens’ digit and the second die (also numbered one to
zero) read as the ‘units’ digit. So, rolling a ‘4’ and then a ‘6’ was read as a ’46.’ If the first die
read a ‘0’, that meant the second die was just read as the single digit, with a ‘0’ and a’7’ being

Designing Tabletop Games

read as ‘7.’ If, however, two zeros were rolled, that result ’00,’ was treated as ‘100.’ So, Todd
needed to roll a zero (‘0’) on the first die and a ‘1’ or a ‘2’ on the second die to generate a Crit
in the first place.
As he always did, he rolled to two dice one after the other rather than at the same time
(a habit that most players found annoying but this time added to the suspense). The first die
read ‘0.’ “Whoa, cool,” he said. Then rolled the second die and his face lit up. “Two!” Indeed
the second die read ‘2’ which meant he had rolled ’02,’ or a Crit. “Whoa, whoa, whoa!” he
yelled. “How much damage does that do?”
“Well, the max damage of the dagger is 8 points, so all of that counts against the trolls’
total hit points.”
“Which is?”
“17.”
Silence.
“And after this, he goes, right?” Todd was hoping I’d reply in the negative.
“Uh, yeah.” I tried to say that in as hopeful a way as I could.
“And that means he’s gonna kill me right?”
“Probably.”
“Oh, well.” Todd began to crumple the character record. Steve chimed in again. “Man,
don’t forget your roll on the Crit Table.”
“Whatever,” and Todd grabbed the two D10s and just tossed them carelessly across the
Battlemat. They stopped rolling.
We just stared. The two D10s came up “0” and “1”. Steve was quiet “I think that’s a good
thing.” I looked at the table. It read:
“01: If weapon is a stabbing type, the attacker has managed to lodge the blade in the eye of the target,
driven very deep with great force into the target’s brain, killing the target instantly. Target is dead.”
Todd screamed. Steve screamed. I beamed quietly, knowing that this singular event had
created a gaming memory for everyone at the table, and cemented Todd’s participation in
the campaign for ever more. To this day, when we see each other and we talk about gaming,
Todd doesn’t talk about Strat-O-Matic (well, not TOO much, anyway) but never fails to bring
up that Sunday afternoon at my gaming table in Elizabeth, NJ. The drama, the impossible
odds realized, the improbability of the event, all combined to cement the memory in all
those present. Forever.
___________
One of tools for evoking player emotion that modern computer RPGs have taken away
from game designers is the ability of the player to directly manipulate, understand and experience game systems themselves. The physical interaction of player and the game systems,
if those systems are designed well, induce emotion in the players just from the way they
work and how the players use them. In this essay, I’d like to discuss and analyze examples of
this effect: the effect dramatized in the actual events depicted above. Yes, while embellished
slightly (the event happened in the summer of 1982, almost thirty years ago, so the dialogue
is dramatized), the details of the event are as they actually happened. This event underlines
my premise, and allows me to discuss this player/game system interaction in detail, because
the easiest game system with which to show this effect is to use the way dice systems work
in roleplaying games (RPGs).

41

42

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

RPG dice systems have a particular bonus in the way they invoke player emotion, as
those dice systems determine success or failure of the player’s actual alter ego, his character.
In the best of those designs, dice not only provide randomized conflict resolution, they also
provide a foundation for the emotional experience; tangibly manifesting the world to the
players as they manipulate the world’s totems - the dice.
Like most things, game design is cyclical. The passions and likes of the gamer audience
wax and wane with time, often coming back to enjoy popular motifs heretofore out-of-fashion time and time again. My roots as a game designer are in the fertile turf of board/penciland-paper game design, and I migrated into computer/video design more to make a living as
a designer, rather than from a particular passion for that style of gaming. Don’t misinterpret
me; however, I enjoy playing World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, Railroad Tycoon and SimCity just
as much as the next geek, but there is something ‘visceral’ to me about boardgames and their
younger, geekier sibling, roleplaying games, that always have a soft spot in my heart.
Part of this fascination, to my way of thinking, resides in the physicality of the game
props and systems, including lovely printed four-color game boards, cards, pieces, and, the
focus of this essay, the dice. While one could debate with some validity the impact of images
appearing on the screen of a video game as opposed to the impact of printed game parts, the
dice to me have a particular fascination as they do not have a direct equivalent in the video
game world. Part random number generator, part talisman, these objects viscerally connect
the player with the game systems, precisely because the player manipulates the outcomes of
these systems by rolling the dice. Talk all you want about digital media being ‘interactive,’
I posit that there is no greater degree of interactivity than the kind a player gets when they
have the dice in their hand and are trying to manifest a particular result to appear, face-up,
on any particular throw of the dice.
One reason for the power of this activity, I believe, is a kind of ‘head fake’ where the
player, because she is holding the random number generator in her hand, believes that they
can affect the roll in some fashion. While the left-brains amongst us would claim they don’t
really believe this is possible, almost every game player I’ve ever met feels as if they can,
indeed, affect the roll. I happen to believe that you can affect the result, but that belief does
not affect my game designs and is a topic for another discussion.
Owing to this feeling of connection, the act of rolling dice carries with it an emotional
charge which, if the designer is aware of it, can be leveraged to deepen the game experience.
Additionally, if the designer is a master of this game prop, the actual use of the random
properties inherent in a random result generated for the audience to see can also aid in telling the game story.
In order to illuminate my point, this article will describe the mechanics of a simple thirtyyear-old RPG system, the D100 system used by Chaosium’s games, called Basic Role Playing
(BRP). It was used specifically in Call of Cthulu and RuneQuest, and the rules have shown a
remarkable resiliency even in this day of the ‘D20’ system made ubiquitous by Wizards of
the Coast. The rules are still in print and available here: (http://www.chaosium.com/article.
php?story_id=246). While possibly not the most elegant RPG dice system ever invented (Greg
Gorden’s exponential dice system he created for Mayfair’s DC Heroes might win that award if
I were voting), I used the D100 system for a very long time in my RPG campaign, I adapted it
(er, was ‘inspired by it’) for the dice system I created for the James Bond 007 game I designed
for Victory Games, and was always cognizant of the impact dice systems had on players.
BRP was very flexible (Chaosium used it for more than a dozen titles over its long life) but
when WOTC made the D20 system openly available in the 1990s, it was all-but abandoned
as a viable RPG system.

Designing Tabletop Games

The D100 BRP system was born in an era when D&D was the newly crowned king of the
gaming world. D&D’s original dice system, in case you were unaware, introduced many new
exotic kinds of dice to the world: D4s, D8s, D10s, D12s and D20s. These new (to most gamers)
dice were part of what gave D&D its appeal, and some of the ‘magic’ of that game was the
‘ooh, cool dice!’ factor for players. One of the things you could do with the D10’s, however,
was roll two of them and read the pair sequentially, thus generating an equally weighted
number from 1 to 100. If the first die read ‘0’ and the second die read ‘1’, this was read as ‘01,’
or simply ‘1’. If the first die read ‘0’ and the second die read ‘0,’ that was read as ‘100.’ First die
‘4’ and the second die ‘5,’ and you had ‘45.’ D&D used this D100 system mainly with random
lists of up to 100 items. Each entry on such a list would have a 1/100th chance to being generated, which facilitated long detailed lists of esoteric objects. Lots o’ fun.
While I’m not exactly sure whether the events occurred in this sequence, my memory is
that after D&D was released, the people working on RuneQuest took the ability to generate a
number from 1-100 and built their conflict resolution system around that pillar. While RuneQuest (hereafter RQ) included D4s, D6s and D8s (you almost had to include those kinds of
dice in role playing games published around 1978 in order to be taken seriously as an RPG),
none of those dice were used for combat resolution in BRP. Instead, they were all used to calculate the amount of damage done if you did hit. To see whether you did hit or not, you rolled
a D100. Your chance to hit something was expressed as a 1-100 number as well -- for example,
‘67.’ Thus, if you roll a 67 or less with your D100, you hit. Rolling a 68 or greater meant you
missed. This kind of system emulated the state of the art at that time in D&D, where they
used a D20 to resolve the ‘hitting’ thing, generating either success or failure.
Degree of Success
To this basic system, however, the RQ designers added what I later called ‘degree of success’ (I’m not sure whether they gave it a name quite like that). The dice system not only
determined success or failure, but how well or how badly the player succeeded or failed. Two
layers of success were added: ‘Critical Success’ (hereafter referred to as a ‘Crit’) and a ‘Special
Success,’ hereafter called simply a ‘Special.’ Failure had only one additional layer, that of a
failure so bad it was termed a ‘Fumble.’
The D100 roll needed to achieve these results were calculated as a percentage of the players’
original success chance: a Crit was determined by multiplying the Success Chance by 5%, and
a Special was determined by multiplying the Success Chance by 20%. Crits were better for the
player than a Special, and a Special was better for the player than a Normal success. Success
in combat was measured first by hitting the opponent, and then additionally by the amount of
damage done.
For example, if the player’s Success Chance was 60 (rolling a 60 or less on D100), 5% of that
was a Crit (rolls 01, 02, and 03), while 20% of that was termed a Special (rolls 01-12, with 01-03
being a Crit and 04 or above being a Special). If the player rolled a Special, more dice were
rolled for damage, and the blow was harder to Dodge (in fact, it needed a Special Dodge on
the defender’s part). If a Crit was rolled, the maximum possible damage was done and the
defender only avoided being hit by rolling a Crit Dodge. In that game system, a Crit was a
devastating blow indeed, because the character did maximum possible damage AND all the
defender’s armor was ignored.
Fumbles were calculated as were Crits, but the dice range was placed at the other end of
spectrum and was calculated from the Failure chance. So, if the player’s Success chance was,
say, 20 or less, his failure chance was 80, and his Fumble chance was 5% of 80 (or 4 chances out
of 100), thus the failure roll was 97-100. This may sound complicated, but there were look-up
tables to handle the calculations.

43

44

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

It is important to understand that the very fact that ‘success’ was placed at the low end of
the dice result possibilities and ‘failure’ at the extreme high end also expresses my theory. Players would desire to ‘roll low’ to get a good result and they would try to avoid ‘rolling high’ so
as not to get near a fumble.
That note actually brings us to the reason why this system was troublesome for some
players: the math. The feeling the game system delivered to players worked just fine, thank
you, but the simple mathemetical manipulations needed to get there were problematic. Intellectually, the system seemed fine; a 1-100 system gave the GM the opportunity for fine gradations in success chances (“hmm, I’ll give you a +8 to your success chance for coming up from
behind him, but he gets a -6 for his Sixth Sense, so that’s an overall +2 for you, your adjusted
chance to hit goes from 57 to 59.”) That seemed like an advantage, but in practical terms there
was a lot of adding and subtracting.
As a little generational observation, the system worked a lot better ‘back in the day,’ as
players of my generation handled the addition and subtraction in their heads with a lot
greater ease than do the ‘youngun’s’ of today do (perhaps not as used to having to do that
kind of math on the fly). I GM’ed a campaign using this system in the 2007-2008 timeframe
and players in their mid-20’s really enjoyed the visceral nature of the system (the ‘emotional
manipulation’ the system delivered as described in this essay) but they relied on us ‘oldtimers’ at the table to handle all the math. That campaign had a little bit of ‘oldtimer’ cool to
it; I GM’ed while Zeb Cook (of AD&D fame) played.
Anyhow, I digress. The point of the system is this: players really enjoyed rolling for the
goals they knew to be present and visible. “What do I need for a Crit and what do I need for
a Special?” were often uttered just as the players were shaking the two D10’s in their hand
prior to their roll. And, if the roll was just short of a goal, there was a very palpable feeling
of being ‘almost a crit.’ If the player needed a 15 for a Special and rolled a 16, cries of agony
rose from the table, even though the system resolved the 16 identically as a roll of, say, 47
(assuming both were a success).
Let me just amplify this a bit: having the dice system deliver a described result (Critical, Special, Normal and Fumble) not only enabled and encouraged the players to visualize
what those results might be in their noggins, it allowed the players to translate dice results
that almost reached one of those thresholds and enjoy the drama of the ‘not quite’ nature.
Knowing what they had to roll, and knowing how close (or far) they came, increased their
visualization of the gameplay.
Now, if the player rolled a Fumble, well, the pain and anguish were tangible. It was more
than simply the fact of failure; when the description of the fumble was read to the player
(example: “adventurer slips on the blood-covered floor and his weapon is thrust into the leg
of the nearest companion, impaling them”) this act of ineptitude begat a legend of its own
(assuming the players’ characters survived the evening, of course). These incidents created
much more than the math and damage done would simply generate numerically. They created drama.
While the D100 system functioned well enough as a game system, the drama that came as
a result of understanding (and pre-visualizing) the potential outcomes and how to maximize
success, combined with the always-present potential for outright disaster with a fumble (regardless of how high the player’s chance of success might be) as well as the glorious success
of a crit, gave every single roll a sense of the dramatic that the players enjoyed. All of this
drama came from the simple fact of life in these games: the game system was visible to the
players, they generated the random numbers needed to make the system work themselves,

and thus ‘created’ the game as they played. They did not just watch as a computer resolved
every swing and applied the damage. Designers of those systems didn’t need to search for
ways to make the players feel more involved; those players were involved from the word go.
Using Dice Systems to Tell a Story
In addition to the simple resolution of combat, the Chaosium systems have also used dice
to help players visualize the action in a visceral way as well as to deliver the world story to
them. I’ll describe both of those facets now.
RuneQuest Hit Location System
RuneQuest’s Crit system, combined with a Hit location system, delivered a distinct flavor
to the gameplay. The Crit system basically communicated that at almost any time, with a
series of very good dice rolls, anyone could kill anyone else. Thus every combat had drama
built in. Their Hit Location system, which was based on research done by one of their designers into the way sword fighting was done in Society for Creative Anachronism battles,
also added a degree of the visceral. But, it also altered strategy. In typical D&D battles, where
an opponent was viable until dead, every fight lasted until one side or the other reached zero
hit points (dead). With the RQ system, a viable strategy was to just ‘take out the legs’ of an
opponent, because once they went down, they couldn’t follow you any longer, and you could
move on to another opponent. Certain types of wounds were as good as a kill. The result in
play was that the battlefield was littered with wounded characters and monsters instead of
piles of dead. It just ‘felt’ different, and thus the kinds of adventures you created as gamemaster differed as well.
Demon Armor
In another variant of the BRP system, Elric!, certain types of armor a character could wear
were imbued with the power of a chaotic demon. This power gave the armor more protection
points than a set of comparable normal armor. The system stated that when damage was applied to a target from a successful hit, the armor protection rating was subtracted from the
damage first before it was applied to the target. So, if your character did 8 points of damage but
the monster was wearing 3-point leather, you did only five effective points of damage (8 - 3) = 5.
However, if a demon inhabited the armor, the exact amount of protection the armor afforded was determined at the moment of impact by a die roll. For example, a suit of leather
demon armor might protect for 2+D4 points. When an attack hit the armor, you rolled a D4; the
armor (for that hit only) might protect for 3 (2 + a roll of 1 = 3) or it might protect for 6 (2 + a roll
of 4 = 6). You couldn’t tell. More powerful demons used larger dice to determine their possible
protection, but also more chaotic demons had a bigger swing of protection values.
So, one demon might have an armor value of 5+D12, a range from 6 through 17. Another
demon might have an armor value of 5+2D6, also a range from 6 through 17. The first demon’s
range had an equal chance of a 6, an 11, or a 17. However, the second demon’s distribution,
because the 2D6 roll was a bell curve, had a much greater chance of a 12 (right in the middle of
the distribution) than it did of generating a 6 or a 17. Thus, the second demon would be viewed
as more ‘predictable’ while the first demon would be viewed as more ‘chaotic.’

The D20 System: Simpler, but less drama?
Once RPGs proliferated, the challenges of the genre for the gamer became the expanding
variety of systems. Just because you know how to play, say, West End Games’s Star Wars, didn’t
mean you know how to play SPI’s Universe, or GDW’s Traveller (even though all these games
were science-fiction RPGs). Players would play one system, begin to know it intimately, then
perhaps a new system would arrive and the gaming group would discuss the option of giving that system a try. But someone would bow out because they just didn’t want to invest the
time to learn something new. Game companies were aware of this, especially Chaosium, who
proposed all their games use a similar system so players might move from one game system
to another as painlessly as possible. All the Chaosium game systems (Elric, RuneQuest, Call of
Cthulu) had similar conflict resolution systems (married to slightly different skill lists).
As long as you were a fan of Chaosium’s product line, and stayed there, the system switches were relatively painless.
But many companies tried to distinguish themselves with innovative game systems. The
hobby market has faced this problem over and over. In response, Wizards of the Coast created
the D20 system. Well, they didn’t create it so much as make the system ‘open source.’ The D20
system was at the heart of D&D, and what Wizards did was say “hey, anyone can use the D20
system if they want to, all they need to do is acknowledge that the system is ours, and that
they are using our system, and they’re home free.” And many companies, seeing the economic advantages of using the system, adopted it. The advantages were numerous: RPG players
wouldn’t need to learn multiple systems, just one; adventures published for one system would,
with a little tweaking, work for other systems; and those companies wouldn’t have to invent
their own systems any longer, they could just co-opt the D20 system. But the sense of the dice
design embodying the essence of the IP of the game world evaporated with these advantages.
That facet of RPG game design lost its steam, and, in my opinion, also lost much of the possibility of dice systems evoking emotion in gameplay.
Computer Games
Today’s computer games hide all the calculations from the player. This can be an advantage, in that the designer can utilize calculations of much greater complexity than ever before.
This allows a greater range of game possibilities. But designers struggle to find ways to weave
back into gameplay some sense of the dramatic. Luck isn’t the only thing that drives a dramatic
conflict resolution system. Doing exactly the right thing at exactly the right moment is crucial
for great storytelling. But knowing what that moment is, and how slim your chances really are,
can be challenging for videogame designers.
I recently spoke to a colleague working on an MMO, where small, almost undeterminable
‘adds’ are the way most of those games are designed. This is almost required, as players desire
to accumulate pieces of armor and such as they play, and you can’t max out the system too easily by this kind of accumulation. The downside of this is that no ‘magical’ aid is very dramatic,
and at the end of the day everything just tends to fade into the background, and nothing seems
to matter. At least to this observer, nothing seems to matter.
My colleague complained about this very issue, as he is also a dramatist and a writer, and
yearns for those moments as well. His staff systems designer, an MMO veteran and someone
who revels in those minute differences, can’t see what the big deal is about my colleague’s
concerns. He worries about ‘balance’ and ‘max/min’ play styles, and in his job, I suppose he
should. But something is lost, and my colleague and I both sense it.

Designing Tabletop Games

Visible, rolled-by-humans dice and the ability they bring to add the unexpected, definitely
add drama to games. As someone who came of age playing games where I could tell how
tough or easy something was, I desperately miss that kind of drama when I play computer or
video games. I always try to figure out a way to add that back into play. Games sometimes can
be shallow experiences without that kind of drama.

DESIGNING FOR PUBLISHING
JT Smith

Designing tabletop games is a far more challenging undertaking than anyone first expects.
There are many factors to take into account that can quickly turn a seemingly simple project
into something much more complicated.
Just like writing a book, when designing a game you have to identify your audience: Who
are they? What do they know? What are their biases? How will their knowledge and biases
affect gameplay? How does it affect what mechanics you’ll use? How does it affect how you
write the rules? Just like a good book, knowing what to leave out is often more important
than knowing what to put in.
In addition to establishing your audience, you should anticipate the special needs of your
target players. Are they color blind? About 8% of males and 0.5% of females have some form
of color blindness. Is your target player a child? If so, you’ll have to get your game CPSIA certified. If they are in the infant to toddler range then you’ll likely need all paper components
laminated with plastic for the drool factor. Are your target players older than 40? If so, make
sure there is no fine print or they may have trouble seeing it. And the list goes on.
Games must also be packaged to sell. A sign of a newbie game designer is failure to take
into account the retail experience when designing the game. There are many reasons why
all game designers should keep this under consideration. Will the game be sold primarily
in brick and mortar stores? If so, there are specific form factors that those retailers prefer. If
the game will be sold at multi-lingual venues you should include multi-lingual text on the
outside of the box, and multi-lingual instructions. Did you take into account that 60 to 70% of
the retail price of your game will be divided between distributors and retailers? You should
also research the prices of other similarly sized games of the same or related genre to make
sure you are asking a reasonable price for yours.

All of these things are important, but there’s another factor that’s becoming more and
more important: designing your game for the publishing process, including manufacturing,
marketing, and distributing.
Traditional Game Publishing
It used to be that every game went through the same publishing and sales process. A
game would be picked up by a publisher, they would print 3,000 to 5,000 copies on an offset
press, and then they’d push the game out the door through their various distribution channels. If the game was successful, they’d print more copies and repeat. Virtually every game
you see in your local game store from Settlers of Catan to Ticket to Ride has gone through this
path.
The only variant in this formula is that some people choose to do a vanity run (selfpublish). Most of these fail due to lack of distribution. There are many reasons a distributor
decides against picking up a game from an indie publisher. Often, the games just aren’t very
good because indie developers didn’t invest time in playtesting. Most of the time, a small
publisher won’t have the means or knowledge to do the market research to see if their game
is actually a niche product. And don’t forget that buyers are creatures of habit who pretty
much always prefer buying a product from a name they recognize.
Regardless of whether or not you use a publisher or do a vanity run, the process for
manufacturing and distributing the game remains the same. You design high-resolution
artwork, print several thousand copies, and get custom game parts made and included in
the box. Then, you make deals with distributors and retailers to sell your game. Your out-ofpocket expense for manufacturing and distribution can be around 90% of the retail price of
your game, and you end up the proud owner of $5,000 to $50,000 worth of game inventory. If
you want to make sure this doesn’t happen to you, make sure you keep your manufacturing
costs in line with the retail price of the game. A good rule of thumb is that the manufacturing cost should be no more than 17% of the retail price.
The biggest benefit of this route has always been, and will always be, that you can do
pretty much anything you want. You can print game components to be as large as the offset
press will allow, which is usually pretty large. You can get custom plastic or wooden game
parts made and included in the box. You can design custom packaging to fit any specification. The sky is really the limit.
The only strategic considerations you have to take are whether to use plastic parts or
wood, and how few components you can use to keep the game playable, yet profitable. You
might also think about whether to use a four color printing process, or just a one/two color
process. These are the basic variables you can play with, and almost everything else is just
the cost of doing business.
The Rise of Print and Play
In the mid-1990’s, with the mainstream adoption of the Internet, a new publishing process, known as print and play (PNP), was widely adopted by indie game designers. Printand-play games are games that are published as PDFs to the web, sometimes for charge, but
usually for free. It is the player’s responsibility to print the game components on a home
printer, and use parts (pawns, dice, etc) from other games they already own.

Board Game Geek’s Canonical List of PNP Games

With this new medium came new design challenges. You want to make your game look
good, but you also have to keep the artwork low resolution so that your target players can
easily and quickly download it. You have no means of distributing parts with your game, so
you have to make do with what you think your players will have on-hand. You also have to
take into account that the player’s printer may only be black and white, and likely can’t print
on anything larger than 8.5” x 11”.
Print and play also brings new business challenges. PNP offers virtually no opportunity
to regain the cost of large production artwork, so as a game designer you have to decide
whether to do it yourself, pay for professional artwork, or make friends with an artist. You
also have to decide what you will charge for the game, if anything. Ask yourself if you are
you doing this because you want people to play your game, or are you doing it for money?
Many designers such as Scott Slomiany choose to go free and gain massive popularity, like
he did with his game Pocket Civ, which has since been turned into various computer and cell
phone games. Others put their print and play games up for charge and are able to make a
small profit, like those on www.wargamedownloads.com. Yet others fail altogether, just like
in the traditional publishing process.
Print and play has a nice advantage in that the web is a built-in distribution mechanism.
There’s no need to find a distributor, because it’s relatively easy and cheap to set up a web
site, although a bit more difficult and expensive to set up an e-commerce web site if you intend to sell your game. However, this also means that 100% of the profit from any sales you
make go directly to you.
In this new era of print and play, savvy game publishers soon realized that they had a
new means of vetting potential games. If a print-and-play game was getting a lot of attention,
game publishers could strike a deal with the designer to make a production version of the
game. Print and play helped level the playing field a bit by removing part of the gamble from
the publishing process. The publisher gained because the game could prove its popularity
