visit during Spring break.) Dylan is in high school and will soon be getting his driving permit. I wonder, how many more Christmas games will there be? When both of the kids have
left the house will I still have the motivation to stay up late on December nights, rushing to
beat an immovable Christmas deadline?
And what new technologies will I have at my disposal? Over the last fifteen years paints
and pencils have been replaced with a high-resolution laser printer. Saws and sandpaper
have been replaced with a precision laser cutter. Some year in the not too distant future will
I be making games with a 3D printer and programmable animatronic robots?
I know one thing for certain: I will continue making games. (Given my history that is
easy to predict.) I look forward to the challenges and changes coming up in the next fifteen
years. It is likely that one of those games will be a simple reindeer matching game with my
first grandchild.

HOW SETTLERS OF CATAN CREATED
AN AMERICAN BOARDGAME REVOLUTION
Ian Schreiber

In 1995, the game that would become Klaus Teuber’s masterpiece was shipped in Germany
by distributor Kosmos. A few German-language copies trickled to the hobby market in the
U.S., fueling demand that allowed Mayfair to produce an English-language version the following year. To date, it has sold more copies worldwide each year than in the previous, a
trend that is the reversal of the sell-millions-in-two-weeks-or-bust sales model of big-budget
videogames. To put things in perspective for any videogame fan in the audience, there are
about as many copies of Settlers of Catan in circulation as there are copies of Grand Theft Auto
3 and World of Warcraft combined.26
To many Americans, the marketing phrase “a boardgame that’s fun for the whole family” is really code that means “a boardgame that’s only fun for children, and we expect the
parents to suck it up and play anyway.” For many, Catan is the boardgame that first proved
to them that well-designed games can actually be fun for children and adults.27
This raises two questions. First, what qualities does Catan possess that allow it to bring
together players of widely varying age and skill? And second, if there were so many other
pre-existing games that share these qualities, what was it about Catan that made it the catalyst that essentially launched a hobby game revolution in the States?
About the Game
Before tackling these questions, it is worth a quick summary of the rules of the game.
What follows are not the complete rules, but it will provide enough of a picture for us to
begin analyzing the gameplay.

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

The board consists of a set of hexagonal tiles that are set up in a random configuration.
Each tile contains both a resource (one of five types: ore, lumber, clay, wheat, or wool), and
a number from two to twelve (corresponding to the range of values on a roll of two dice).
Players build settlements on the intersections between tiles. During the course of play they
build new roads to connect their settlements, and they can build new settlements or upgrade
their settlements into cities.
This game is played in turns, with turn order proceeding clockwise, as in many games.
On a player’s turn, three things happen:
• First, the player rolls two dice. All resource tiles with the corresponding number produce that resource, giving one of that resource to each adjacent settlement or two to
each city of any player.
• Next, the player may trade their resources. They can trade with the bank at a rate of
four for one (a terrible exchange rate by any reckoning), or they can trade with other
players for any exchange rate that both players agree to. Note that the other players
can only trade with the player whose turn it is.
• Finally, the player may spend resources. They can build roads expanding outward
from existing roads or settlements. They can build new settlements along their roads.
They can upgrade settlements to cities, which produce extra resources. And they can
buy progress cards, which offer a variety of special one-use abilities.
The object of the game is to be the first player to reach ten Victory Points (VP). Players
earn one VP for every settlement and two for every city that they own on the board. Players
can also earn two special bonuses, one for having the longest contiguous road and one for
having the greatest number of Army cards (the most common type of progress card), each
worth two VP.
Game Dynamics
When we analyze the mechanics, we can see some interesting properties of Catan:
• Measured randomness. There are random elements in the game, such as die rolls and
the shuffled deck of progress cards. However, the constraints of the randomness (odds
of die rolls and distribution of progress cards) are known to the players, allowing
them to strategically play the odds.
• Competitive, but not confrontational. On the one hand, players are in competition
with each other; only one player can win, and it is a race to reach ten VP. On the other
hand, the competition is mostly indirect. Players cannot destroy each other’s cities or
settlements or otherwise steal VP from each other; one player’s gain is not necessarily
another player’s loss. Players can harm each other’s standing in more direct ways (for
example, there are mechanisms for stealing resources), but these tend to be limited
and short-term losses. More often, players spend their time trading with one another,
working out mutually beneficial exchanges. Even in a competitive game, the primary
focus is on working together.
• Variety of play. The board is set up randomly each game. One game may have all of
the wheat clustered together in one area, leading to some players forming a wheat oligopoly. Another game might have ore only produced on rolls of two, three and twelve,
leading to massive ore shortages. Some setups have a small number of prime building locations for cities, while others have a larger number of mediocre building sites.
Because of this, no two games are exactly the same, and each brings its own unique
set of challenges.

Game Analyses

• Multiple paths to victory. There are many ways to reach ten VP. You can build a large
network of roads and pop up small settlements everywhere. Or, you can focus on a
smaller number of settlements and upgrade them into cities. You can go after the VP
bonus for building roads, or the bonus for buying progress cards, or even both. No
strategy is automatically better than the others; all are theoretically viable, but their
efficacy varies based on the current board and game state. Because of this, players are
encouraged to modify their strategy based on circumstances, leading to a more varied
play experience.
• Constrained play time. Due to the nature of the game, players are constantly advancing towards the final goal. Players can gain but never lose settlements or cities, so the
game is more or less guaranteed to end within a certain time range. Games typically
take between sixty and ninety minutes, pushing the upper end of a child’s attention
span.
• Minimal downtime. Players rarely have time when they have nothing to do. On other
players’ turns they are collecting resources and participating in resource trades. Even
when players have nothing to do (perhaps they have no resources, or they have all
they need), turns are short enough to keep the action going.
“Fun for the Whole Family”
These properties – measured randomness, competition without confrontation, variety,
multiple paths to victory, constrained play time, and minimal downtime – are common in
many “Eurogames,” not just Catan. These properties do not just appear randomly in games.
Game designers deliberately craft their games to have these properties, because it allows the
games to appeal to a wide age range.
Measured randomness provides enough of an advantage to a lucky player to keep less
skilled (typically younger) players from frustration, because a string of good die rolls can
always turn the game in their favor, so they never feel like they have no chance. The randomness also lessens the sting of defeat: the losing players can conveniently blame the luck of the
dice. At the same time, the ability to strategically plan based on one’s understanding of the
game will favor more skilled play in the long run, keeping the more skilled and competitive
players engaged.
With a decreased reliance on confrontational behavior and a major focus on trading and
negotiation, players are less likely to become frustrated with other players’ anti-social or
overly-competitive behaviors. This can prevent hurt feelings and ruffled feathers among
younger children, or harshly competitive adults. It also encourages good sportsmanship and
best behavior, as players are less likely to trade with or assist someone who is being unfriendly.
Variety of the game setup and the existence of multiple viable strategies give the game
a much longer shelf life. Play cannot devolve into players following rote patterns or always
pursuing the same strategies; the randomness of the game encourages players to have a variety of experiences. Repeat play is important, as it allows the game to be played regularly as
a family activity that does not get boring or stale for a long time.
Constrained play time and reduced downtime cater to young players with relatively low
attention spans, helping them to stay engaged. The game is also long enough to offer a satisfyingly complete experience to older and more patient players.

Not a perfect game
As with any game, Catan has its share of flaws. These generally seem minor to first-time
players, but may wear on an individual after repeated play (by which time, that individual
has likely discovered other Eurogames). For example:
• Uneven starting positions. Depending on the board setup, certain seats may be more
or less advantageous than others. For example, on a board where certain key resources
are clustered together (say, there is a Wheat hex with the number six, but all other
Wheat hexes have infrequent numbers like two or twelve), there may be one single
position on the board that is better than all the others. This would give an advantage
to the first player, who gets to place their initial settlement first. Conversely, other
board setups may have three or four prime building locations, giving the first player a
disadvantage: they gain little if any advantage from first placement, but they place last
when placing their second settlement during game setup, meaning that their second
settlement may be in a less valuable location than the other players. To be fair, uneven
starting positions do encourage players to trade and cooperate, since everyone starts
with access to different kinds of resources; but the starting positions can also give
some players the negative perception that they are at an inherent disadvantage from
the beginning.
• A positive feedback loop. Near the end of the game, players have expended their network of settlements and cities to the point where those in the lead are gaining large
amounts of resources each turn, and the game typically ends quickly once it reaches a
certain point. By contrast, the beginning game can sometimes feel slow, particularly if
the dice roll numbers for resources that few players have built on, or if a lot of sevens
are rolled (which allow players to steal resources from one another, rather than generating net wealth for everyone on the board). A player who falls behind in the early
game because their numbers refuse to come up on the dice can feel frustrated for the
rest of the game. Even in the end game, a player with six VP may feel they have no
chance to win when other players have eight or nine.
• Unbalanced progress cards. The progress cards vary from being a net loss (gain two
resources of your choice, but it already cost you three resources to buy the card) to
marginally useful (a free Victory Point) to a huge swing in the game state (force all
opponents to hand over to you all of their resources of a type of your choice). The unpredictability of the cards stops them from being a consistent strategy. On the other
hand, the few cards that can unbalance the game allow sudden swings that come from
a single event – making the cards feel more arbitrary than exciting.
Not the only Eurogame
Catan is not the only game, or even the first game, to embody Eurogame characteristics
(measured randomness, competition without confrontation, variety, multiple paths to victory, constrained play time, and minimal downtime). Indeed, players new to Catan often
quickly find their way to other Eurogames, sometimes newer and sometimes older.
Consider Can’t Stop, released in 1980. This is a dice game in which players attempt to
move their pieces to the end of tracks labeled with the numbers two through twelve. Players roll four dice, then split them into two sets of two dice, and advance their pieces on the
corresponding tracks. Players can only advance up to three tracks per turn, but can continue
rolling to advance along those tracks as much as they desire. However, a roll that cannot

Game Analyses

advance at least one track causes all gains on that turn to be wiped out, leading to a series
of push-your-luck decisions of risk-versus-reward. This game has measured randomness, as
the risk/reward calculations are pure mathematics, but a player can still have a lucky (or unlucky) roll. There is competition in trying to reach the ends of each track first, but very little
confrontation, as players cannot directly set back their opponents. There is variety, in that
certain numbers become unavailable as play progresses, making each game play a little different than the others. There are multiple paths to victory, both in terms of which numbers
to go for, and in how risky or safe a player chooses to be on their turns. Play generally lasts
about half an hour, and since turns always end in either some progress or none (but never
a net loss) the game is always approaching completion. Player turns go quickly, so players
generally don’t have to wait long between turns.
Or consider Bohnanza, released in 1997. As a game with the core mechanic of trading
with other players, it could be thought of as a heavily streamlined version of Catan. Players are dealt a hand of cards of different kinds of beans, and they are trying to collect up to
two or three different kinds of beans (the rest are of much lower value to them). Players can
trade freely with each other to plant their beans and harvest them for points. There are no
upgrades or special cards to buy as there are in Catan, nor is there a game board that affords
any kind of starting advantage, nor any kind of positive feedback loop; players draw a set
number of cards each turn, and continue playing until the deck empties three times.
Bohnanza offers measured randomness (cards are dealt randomly, but each card displays
how many matching cards exist in the deck, so players have the opportunity to do cardcounting and probability calculations at the table). There is competition but not confrontation (players mainly get ahead by making good trades, after all, so it is in everyone’s best
interest to be friendly to their opponents). There is variety during play (since players receive
different sets of cards from game to game). There are multiple paths to victory (players can
try to collect small sets of beans for marginal but steady gains, or large sets for larger but
more infrequent scoring; they may try for rare beans or more common ones; and they may
collect beans that everyone else is neglecting, or compete with opponents for the same bean
type). Play time is constrained (players draw cards every turn, so the game is guaranteed
to last for a set number of turns). Downtime is minimized (since players are always trading
with each other, even when it’s not their turn).
The rules of both Can’t Stop and Bohnanza are simpler than Catan, and the games play
faster. As each is easier to play and easier to teach, both games are accessible to a slightly
younger audience while keeping many of the same positive qualities of Catan. Keep in mind
that these are merely two examples out of dozens, perhaps hundreds of games that offer similar qualities. And yet, more often than not for those being introduced to Eurogames for the
first time, it is Catan that is the gateway to these other games and not the other way around.
Why Catan and not some other game?
All of the characteristics that make Catan so compelling can be found in many games.
What was it about Catan in particular that made it such an international sensation, if the
gameplay is not unique?
In fact, some Eurogames did come to the States in the 1980s and were commercially disappointing.28 The success of Catan, then, relies as much on its historical context as its game
mechanics.
Before Eurogames could reach a certain level of success, they needed a market of enthusiastic hobby gamers. For that to happen, a few other events had to happen first.

For the first half of the 20th century, boardgames were not considered a hobby in mainstream American culture. Games were a pastime, perhaps. They were a family bonding
activity. They were a way to pass a rainy afternoon. But with few exceptions, people did
not think of games as part of their identity or part of their regular weekly schedule. This
began to change in the 1960s with the rise in popularity of historical wargames (this period
also saw a rise in American-designed boardgames, many of which were published by the
same companies that produced wargames). The audience expanded considerably in the early
1970s with the release of Dungeons & Dragons (itself derived from the fantasy-based wargame
Chainmail). With the rising popularity of tabletop wargaming and later tabletop roleplaying, players were encouraged to form groups and meet on a regular basis to play the latest
wargame release or to continue their roleplaying campaigns. For the first time, games were
not just a one-off activity, but an ongoing and regular hobby. With the success of these new
genres of tabletop game, a hobby market for games emerged and expanded.
However, there was another condition required for any hobby game to reach the level of
popularity that Catan eventually did, and that was the ability to spread virally throughout
the hobby game community. In the 1960s and 70s, the internet was still a military project
and not the mainstream online social community that it is today. Tabletop game conventions existed, but drew crowds of thousands, not the tens of thousands of today. Particularly
with roleplaying games, players tended to play with the same group over time; even if a new
game was introduced into a group, there was not necessarily a large cross-pollination with
other groups, so the spread of new games was limited. While there were some retail stores
that were dedicated to hobby games and some of these served as local gaming community
centers, the hobby itself was still small enough that it could not support the kinds of sales
numbers that Catan eventually saw. For a breakout hit with multi-million-unit sales, another
game would first need to be released to expand the market and form larger, more fluid communities. The year this happened was 1993, and the game was Magic: the Gathering.
Magic was practically an overnight sensation. With its open-ended business model that
allowed players to spend however much they wanted, it became profitable enough that some
stores were able to exclusively support themselves with trading-card game products. While
D&D mostly required players to form a single closed group, the short play time and competitive nature of Magic allowed players to play with friends or strangers. Magic tournaments
were organized, bringing together gamers who might not have had occasion to play together
otherwise. The success of Magic also significantly boosted attendance at game conventions,
with 1995 being a record high attendance at both Gen Con and Dragon Con. As a result, local, national, and global communities organized around the game, often with game stores
themselves serving as cultural centers for players to meet and play.
When Catan came along with its near-universal appeal, distribution and sales channels
were available. Additionally, hobbyist game groups and communities had already formed
around games that could be individually played in a short time span; integrating a new
board or card game into an afternoon’s Magic play session was an easy transition.
Summary
In this chapter, we explored the success of the boardgame Settlers of Catan. In part, this
is because Catan catered to a previously unserved market of game players that were looking for a family game with broad age appeal. The appeal of the game comes from its mix of
mechanics. Children and casual players are satisfied by the game’s relatively simple rules,
limited play time, lack of downtime, and sufficient random events that allow small victories
and a chance of winning even to players who are unskilled. Sophisticated gamers can enjoy

Game Analyses

the complex player interactions and strategic depth. While these properties are true of many
games (and in fact, many games arguably serve these needs better than Catan), this particular game came along at just the right time historically, allowing it to reach a broad market.

26 As of 2009, there have been more than 18 million copies of Settlers of Catan sold worldwide (this is just the base

set in its various incarnations, not counting expansion sets, spin-offs, and digital versions). By contrast, there were
about 8 million units of Grand Theft Auto 3 sold and 11 million World of Warcraft subscribers.
27 Germany, meanwhile, had a backlog of decades of excellent games, which provided plenty of fuel for the Eurogame market in America once it became established.
28 Examples include Ghosts! (1980), Scotland Yard (1983), and The aMAZEing Labyrinth (1986). Many games from
the 80s were reprinted after Catan opened the distribution channels, and have done well in the post-Catan hobby
game market.

CONQUEST
by David Parlett

It’s funny how some people like games to be “about” something while others have no such
desire. The former go for games that might be described as thematic or representational, like
Monopoly or Settlers of Catan; the latter prefer abstracts like Chess, Checkers and Othello. I’m one
of the latter. For me, a game doesn’t have to be about anything other than itself. I think of thematic games as being theatrical: the players seem to be wanting not only to play a game but
also to play a role in a dramatic representation of some aspect of real life. Personally I’m quite
happy with being who I am, and who I am is somebody who enjoys rising to the challenge
of problem-solving in spatial and mathematical relationships. It’s obviously a personality
thing: I don’t much care for drama as such, and hardly ever go to the theater (though I enjoy
movies - so long as they’re not too dramatic!).
I’m one of the older generation of games enthusiasts. A games inventor since childhood,
I first started writing and reviewing for the late Games & Puzzles magazine in 1972, and
invented my first published boardgame, Hare & Tortoise, the following year. Immediately before coming up with that solitary success, I spent several months vainly playing about with
the idea of basing a game on dice - not rolling them so they fall at random, but flipping or
tumbling them by their edges from square to square so that you work out where they would
finish up and with which side uppermost. My first experiment was to place letters on their
sides and move them around in such a way as to form words. This didn’t work very well, so
I tried the next and perhaps more obvious device of keeping to the traditional arrangement
of spots and decreeing that you could roll a cube over as many squares as indicated by the
number on top at the start of your move. There was, if I remember rightly, a 10x10 squared

101

102

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

board and you each started with ten dice on your back row. The obvious objective was to get
one or all of your dice over to the far edge. But, despite much playing around with possible
ideas, I couldn’t get anywhere satisfactory with it, and moved on to something completely
different.
Two years later we received for review at the Games & Puzzles office a dice-rolling game
called Conquest, published by Denys Fisher Games and invented by Geoffrey Hayes (as we
now know, though in those unenlightened days inventors were not credited anywhere on
the published product). I pounced on this game immediately, played it with delight, and
asked to review it. My review appeared in Games & Puzzles #48, dated May 1976, and I am
still playing with the review copy.
To my chagrin, but equal admiration, Hayes had come up with a solution that had consistently eluded me. I quote the following description more or less verbatim from my review.
Each player takes eight large plastic dice of a distinctive color and places them on their
nine-long back rank of a 9 x 8 checkered board. The middle or ‘key’ square of the row is
occupied by a piece awkwardly referred to as a ‘key-dice’, which may be regarded as the
equivalent of a Chess king. The key-piece, marked with a single spot on every face, moves one
square at a time, and the object is to move it across the board so as to occupy the opposing
key square. An alternative win is achieved by capturing your opponent’s key-piece.
The point of the play lies in the way the dice-pieces are used. Each one is rolled (or ‘flipped’
or ‘tumbled’) from square to square so that each succeeding face is turned uppermost as it
crosses the ridge on to an adjacent square - all moves being orthogonal, of course. The distance it moves is determined by the number of spots shown on the top face at the start of a
turn. It must move in a straight line, but may make one (only) right-angled turn at any point
in the course of it. It may not pass over another piece, but may capture an enemy piece by
replacement if its legitimate move brings it on to a square so occupied. And that’s all!
The basic strategy of the game is, of course, to get your pieces working together like an
army or bodyguard to protect the passage of your key-piece across the board, while attacking and removing enemy pieces where possible in order to prevent your opponent from
achieving the same objective. Alternatively you may concentrate less on advancing your
key-piece and more on moving your army out to capture your opponent’s. In either case, skill
depends entirely upon the ability to position pieces correctly and move them in such a way
as to ensure that they finish with a suitable number uppermost. What that is, of course, depends on the position: in an open game sixes are strongest; in a close game threes and fours
are best; ones are nearly always positive weaknesses.
One’s first reaction to the game may well be of bewilderment - at first sight it seems
impossible to quickly think your way around a three-dimensional piece in order to work
out where it can land up and in what orientation. In fact, however, it is a knack that can be
learned in the course of your first few games. Once achieved, the game becomes one of pure
skill, though before you reach that stage the progress of the game does tend to be a bit - er dicey.
Presentation and durability are superb. I particularly admire the way the squares are defined by ridges while the pieces have grooved edges to key them in as they roll over, though
I wish the surfaces were not so slippery. The rules are not bad, but for a game so simple to describe, they ought to be better. I assume, for example, that once you have got your key-piece
on to your opponent’s key square you win immediately, but it would have been helpful of the
rules to confirm that your opponent cannot then snatch away your victory by capturing it at
once. It is a point which, without clarification, could lead to argument.

Game Analyses

The world today is so full of two-player abstract boardgames, most of which are Draughts
(Checkers, for Americans) with knobs on, that it is refreshing to come across one whose concept is so original that it can be explained in a few words. For this reason, and for its intrinsic
depth, Conquest deserves a solid future. I rated it six out of six.
So ended my review. Conquest did indeed go on to enjoy a future of sorts, albeit a rather
piecemeal and scrappy one. To my disgust, it was soon after rebranded for the UK market as
“The George vs. Mildred Dice Game”, in reference to a then popular TV domestic sitcom. It has
appeared in various countries and under various titles, including also Alea, Tactix, and, in
Germany, Duell. (Further details from BoardGameGeek.)
My brother and I have taken it up again recently, and my ten-year-old grandson enjoys it.
Which just goes to confirm, in my view, that a preference for abstract games is a personality
thing, and that personalities tend to run in families.
I’ll just end by adding a few regulatory refinements that don’t appear in the original rules
(I haven’t seen any later ones) but which we have found useful and desirable:
• To decide who plays which color and who begins: One player holds out a dice of each
color concealed in each hand. The other announces a color, for example “Red”, and
points to a hand. The chooser then plays the color actually revealed, and moves first if
(and only if) they correctly predicted that color.
• Having selected which dice to tumble, you should first announce its topmost number
so that your opponent can monitor and correct any mistake in movement.
• You may retract a move but only so long as you have kept in physical contact with the
dice you moved.
• As in Chess, you should announce “Check!” upon placing your opponent’s king en
prise. (There’s no fun in winning a game by your opponent’s lack of observation.) If
you don’t, you can’t take it on your next move. You can announce the check later, but
can’t take it till the move after that, if still possible.
• Most importantly of all (in our opinion): to win, it is not enough to merely move your
king on to your opponent’s king square - it must not then be immediately captured,
otherwise you lose.

FAIR ISN’T FUNNY! THE DESIGN OF COSMIC ENCOUNTER®
by Peter Olotka

Cosmic Encounter has been acknowledged among game designers for its ground breaking
design. We called it a simultaneous-revelation-social-interaction-game. What’s intriguing,
is that unlike the vast army of boardgames in existence, Cosmic Encounter has not been the
victim of copycat products. At the time of this printing, Cosmic has entered its fourth decade
at 38 years old and counting, with a new 2008 version from Fantasy Flight Games and an
Expansion set, Cosmic Incursion from FFG hitting the shelves in 2010.
A 2009 Boardgame Geek review from Nate Owens, a first time player, sums up the game’s
appeal as well as anything written in the previous four decades “…This is no museum piece.
Even if it’s a 32-year-old design, Cosmic Encounter feels as thrilling and cutting edge as anything I’ve ever played.”
Disclosure: Nate is not a relative and I have never met him. Anyway, the $$ I sent him was
a small sum, relatively speaking.
Creative people are always being asked: “How did you come up with the idea?” So let’s
talk about inspiration. As with lots of new designs (in any field), it’s nice to have no clue
about what you are doing. Preconception of what a game is can often be a debilitating factor
among many designers. “Hey let’s get some monsters and give them some stuff, and then
they can go beat up some other monsters. And my innovation is to make a sword that is
worth a gazillion flimbats. Oh and, the graphics will be really cool.”
Yawn.

New Alien: The Snob - power to yawn
It would be able to swat away intruders with the back of its hand - as long as its card was
the lowest.
Anyway, when I am asked, it makes me think of the five second elevator pitch: Risk meets
the Godfather Game in 1971. My partners-to-be and I used to play epic games of Risk. Over
time, the incessant clatter of dice (see my Risk essay in James Lowder’s Family Games Best 100)
cultivated a desire to have a diceless game. Just about then, I saw a picture of the 1971 Godfather Game ensconced in a violin case. I never played it, but was taken with the idea that it was
marketed, literally, outside the box. I was formally bitten by the game design bug, and have
suffered from it lo these many years.
In retrospect here are some of the influences on Cosmic’s design:
• Chess was weighed in strategically because the pieces had their own unique movement.
• Poker had a hand because it was the ultimate bluffing game.
• Star Trek of the sixties scripted Cosmic’s flavor with its self-deprecating stars lurching
around the set.
• Science fiction authors Asimov, Herbert, Niven and Pohl suspended our disbelief, and
we never recovered it.
As long as we are discussing the game, here is a brief retrospective of the team’s cosmic
journey. The Cosmic Encounter design journey started in 1971 with Bill Eberle and myself,
and expanded to four by the time Eon Products, Inc. was founded. We called ourselves
Future Pastimes as a design team. One of the keys to Cosmic’s design was the collaboration
and clash sparked by the personalities and skill sets of the designers. We did everything by
unanimous agreement. Think about that for a minute. Were we mad? Most definitely. But we
produced a cascading rush of rule breaking. “If you can do that than I can do this.”
“Oh yeah? Then I will....”
I brought the idea of doing a game that was different and science fiction based. Bill Eberle contributed seeing everything from unexpected perspectives. Jack Kittredge carried the
torch for logic and rationalism and precision. Bill Norton tossed in offbeat humor and whimsy and then on a whim, sold out for cash. Three way split.
If you are new to design you might want to experiment with thinking in the abstract
about how to theme your game.
Theme is more than window dressing, and less than fanatical immersion. To be true to
theme, a design should strive to capture the essence of the setting or construct by creating
a system in which players naturally adopt behaviors that fit their circumstances. Success is
when a player is surprised to act in a way that is not in keeping with their real life personality, as though it were normal.
In our case, we wanted a science fiction game because we couldn’t find any in 1971. Science Fiction has no restrictions. We were free! The Moody Blues played “Days of Future
Passed.” So we were Future Pastimes. Note: Alert gamer Greg Costikyan has cited the Lensman
boardgame made in 1969 by Philip N. Pritchard. Glad we missed it lest we had fallen in love
with it.
Since we are starting from the abstract and moving to the specific, let’s play the name
game. Game names are tough to come by. Our first take was The Universe Game. We went
through a collection of “not quite” names before settling on Cosmic Encounter. I think it still
needs work. It evokes longhaired hippies sitting under crystal pyramids. Of course the designers were longhaired hippies, who hated rules. So there you go.

And now that we have named it, we have to explain/sell it with a tagline which is very
useful for games which have bad names.
Cosmic Encounter has had in no particular order:
• The science fiction game for everyone
• A quantum leap in games
• The game that breaks it own rules
• Always Different, Always Fun
• A Game of Infinite Possibilities
There are probably even more taglines in the non-English version.
Crafting underlying principles is an important place for the designer to start. I mean, really start here. Draw up a list of principles to follow and /or elements for your game to have.
Then design with them in mind. Here were ours:
• No dice allowed
• Everyone had to be different
• Play would offer compromise and conflict
• No one would be eliminated
• Players could win together
• Each game would be different (re-playability)
• License to cheat. Pretty much all players in all games would just love to be able to
peek. Just a little. Woot!
• Almost all the early Cosmic aliens were hatched from a player wishing “If only …”
• I could see what she has (Mind)
• I could get a do-over (Chronos)
• I could get rid of this junk (Philanthropist)
• I couldn’t die (Zombie)
I think it can be profoundly liberating to make a list of things you want your game to
be and to not be, and then stick to them. Think about your likes and dislikes in the games
you’ve played, and then try to settle on what you want your game to feel like.
A major subsection of crafting your game’s principles has to do with for whom you are
designing. Who is your audience? If you were scoring attendance at a game convention; the
score was Males 90 – Females 10. We all know why. Too many games were humorless exercises in mayhem. It’s still true today. The gorier and war-ier, the bloodier and fouler, the better. Footnote: If you were in the 90% and were just trying to score, the odds were against you.
When Cosmic Encounter was introduced at the cons, despite the 90 - 10 audience, the Cosmic players would be 50% female. We figured that the boys should notice. Good design is
inclusive. Over the years Cosmic Encounter has been praised by many publications, from The
Gifted Children’s Newsletter to The Playboy Winner’s Guide to Board Games, which just shows
the range. Social interaction is an inclusive characteristic for a game.
When you get to mocking up your game for the first time, a whole bunch of surprises spill
out of the physical design. We call this “Cutting the Plant’s Vines.” In our very first tinker
toy-cottage cheese container-erector set-egg carton Cosmic prototype, we had a Plant Alien

107

108

Tabletop: Analog Game Design

with actual foam rubber vines. Each alien was festooned with egg carton cups serving as
planets. If the plant vine could reach your planet it could get a base. The machine had some
wire tendrils that were used in the event that it had to duplicate the plant’s power. We had a
dodecahedron the size of a tennis ball with two each of six colors on its twelve sides. If you
rolled your own color you had to roll again...and...again...and again...
These fussy and annoying mechanisms stopped the developmental progress of Cosmic
for more than a year. But suffice it to say that when we fast talked our way into Parker Brothers and forced them to play our game, all they could do was roll their own color over and
over.
Exit us, in round one of “What do we do now?”
Months later we unceremoniously cut the vines from the Plant and sent the dodecahedron to the archives. The result was a flood of new aliens and new ideas, which birthed the
current incarnation of our game. The moral of the story is to let go early and often.
New Alien: The Preacher - power to moralize
It could offer to let you on to a planet of its choice anywhere in the game.
I like funny games. Games can create a social structure that operates under its own constitution. Most games labor under rules that are designed to be fair. Otherwise why bother
playing? Right? Here’s the problem: Fair is not funny.
Let me put it this way: If you play a game for three hours and follow a complex set of
perfectly balanced rules which feel fair to all, and you eliminate your four opponents one
by one until you are the last one left, it’s not all that funny. And it’s particularly not all that
fun for the losers. Many players and some publishers have railed that things which happen
in Cosmic are “not fair.” In Cosmic Encounter, we give you that rail and allow you to stick it up
your opponent’s.... Especially if said opponent is whining that his alien has no such rail with
which to stick you. This whole process led to the design of the Sniveler, who has the power
to whine. Now that’s funny.
A component of “Not Fair” is “The Gloat.”
When a player makes a stunning upset from a hopeless position, or totally dominates, or
sets up an air-tight strategy, or finds a new wrinkle in an alien power, it introduces the gloat
factor. We would often measure new features which we added to Cosmic by their gloat factor.
The more gloat, the merrier (or the infuriating), depending on whose gloat is being factored.
Game development often gets short shrift, but it is the guts of design. Playtest. A lot.
Don’t be afraid to get rid of things that don’t work. Don’t grow attached to anything in the
game. Be ruthless. And, painful as it always is, we really do need others to weigh in. Listen
to the ones who make a good case for their proposed changes. And never reject any criticism
out of hand. If you do reject it out of hand, sleep on it. The flip side of accepting the critics’
complaints is to design what you like despite the skeptics. Ultimately I suppose it’s a blend.
Since Cosmic Encounter, despite its longevity, has never had blockbuster sales, here are
four cosmic measuring sticks which you can adopt for your low selling but brilliant game.
Losing Can Be Fun
When you hear that the players who lost start out by saying, “I lost but I didn’t care because it was so much fun,” it’s a reminder that in multiplayer games most people lose. So if you
can make losing fun......

I Lost My Game In The Divorce
Here we have the ultimate designer compliment. I mean, you know, the house, the car,
the dog, the Cosmic Encounter set! Footnote: The records of any divorces due to a momentous
spouse-to-spouse Cosmic Gloat have been sealed for the protection of the Cosmic designers.
Surprising The Designers
If, after you are well past the design phase, and you’ve been playing for a while, you
are still surprised by what happens in your very own game, I’d say you have a winner. It
means that your design creates situations that are not planned, but rather are generated by
the unique circumstances of any given game. While I was writing this I surprised myself by
thinking of two new aliens and decided to leave them in here. Just for fun.
The Retelling
This is a measure of a game’s appeal. If it gets a lot of this then it’s a success. (See “Not
Fair” and “The Gloat”.)
Final thoughts.
We in the biz like to think of ourselves as professionals. And I suppose we are. But if
you are reading this book there is a good chance that you might not quite have professional
status just yet. I say good! Focus on creating games that are unique. It’s very crowded out
there in copycat gamer land. Work hard at defining your own space. For most game designers, once bitten by the design bug, there is no choice about your career. You just have to do it,
so you might as well do it well.

THE GREATEST GIFT
by Ray Mazza

Let me introduce myself – I’m Ray Mazza, a recovering traditional game designer. I’ve been
afflicted with a game for more than six years now. This is the story of how I (kind of) published that game, and the words of wisdom I can speak from the experience, with a primary
focus on the creative thought process during the earliest stages of design.
The Beginning: A Brief Word on Games
Rewind to the year 1979. I’m only a few months old, lying in a crib, looking up at my
mom. She smiles, holding a blanket. And then, just like that, she disappears. Poof! Gone. I
look around and don’t see her. Then, suddenly, she’s back. I’m astonished! Holy crap! And
then she does it again. I can’t help but giggle when I see her reappear with her wide green
eyes and a jubilant smile. “Tada!” she exclaims.
For me, this is my first game. My mom is playing Peek-a-Boo with me by hiding behind
a blanket.
On to the year 1986. I’m seven. My mom, dad, sister, and I crowd around a table every
Wednesday for family game night, and play Yahtzee, Uno, Sorry, Careers, Fireball Island, Clue,
Scrabble, and Rummy, to name just a few. I also sometimes wake up at 5:00 am so that I can
sneak some Super Mario Brothers on my Nintendo.
I am now conscious of the fact that games are really fun. Although I probably said I wanted to be a dinosaur when I grew up, I think I subconsciously wanted to make games. Kids
do it all the time – they play with toys and engage in make believe and fabricate elaborate
scenarios and situations and rule sets for what you can and cannot do when you’re playing:

this fallen tree trunk over here is the star-destroyer-battleship and that tire in the sandpit over there
is the escape pod, and the escape pod is immune to laser fire but not immune to this stick which is the
“magical sword of destroying escape pods.”
Many of you grew up with similar experiences, as games have been part of our lives since
the earliest moments of our comprehension. They’re not just a thing we do on occasion for
fun – they’re ineffably etched into the way we live our lives.
Why Games are Important
For many people, games are the most natural form of social group interaction. If a party
doesn’t have at least one game, I dock it points. Games give an event context. There’s no
need to stand around and dig for conversation – a game creates it, and helps you get to know
people, or get to know them better – even friends and family.
Games are so social that by the end, you really learn who the other players are on a level
that you might not have reached so quickly had you been standing around having conversations like:
Guy: So where are you from?
Girl: Oregon.
Guy: That’s a beautiful state.
Girl: Yeah, the coastline is amazing. I hear you’re an English major, huh? What do you think
about Chaucer’s short poems?
Guy: A bit whiny, actually.
Girl: Mmhm. Some people say Chaucer first associated Valentine’s Day with romance.
Guy: Oh yeah? I read that the greeting card industry popularized Valentine’s Day.
This conversation is okay, but you aren’t really learning who the other person is. You
aren’t experiencing something with them, and that’s what games do. People lower their
barriers and reveal their true personalities when they play games. You find out that Grant
giggles like a schoolgirl when someone pantomimes being a banana. You get to experience
the terror of Paul when you don’t support his proposed trade embargo. Somehow it comes
up that Ira can solve a Rubik’s Cube in 12 seconds, and that Natalie wants nothing more in
the entire world than a pair of roller skates, but for some reason she just doesn’t go out and
buy a pair.
This is why games are important. Because as adults, we no longer just make them up
when we’re standing around. We need these games to help us play, socialize, and experience
each other.
Let the Games Begin: Brainstorming
One of the first games I designed was an interesting and informative exercise, as simple
as it was, so I’ll share it. At the time, I was enrolled in a Game Design course taught by Jesse
Schell at Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center graduate program. Assignment number 1? Design a new version of Hopscotch. One should learn to be creative with a
small game before attempting something momentous. Whether you’re designing a boardgame, videogame, or a child’s playground game like Hopscotch, many of the same principles
apply.

Game Analyses

Step 1: Quiet brainstorm time. I find it wildly productive to tie myself to a desk chair and
list out as many ideas around the game or topic as possible. For the first sitting, this is all I
do, and I do it until I wear myself out.
I noted anything and everything that seemed remotely interesting, different, novel, fun,
etc. Thanks to computers (wave of the future) I still have the list. From the mundane to the
insane, here’s a snippet:
• Use eggs as landmines or obstacles on each square. Combine with losing shoes.
• Different height squares
• Throw something that moves instead of a stone
• Hop on the beats of music
• Hopscotch Joust
• Build the course as you go. You toss your stone, and where it lands becomes a square.
• Each turn you can move remove a line from a square or add one (to join or split
squares).
• Dodgescotch (your opponent may throw one large kickball at you during your turn).
• Put huge, strong fans blowing adjacent to the board. They randomly come on. Wear
big flowing clothing and pinwheel hats.
• Add a monkey.
• High stakes Hopscotch (on the edge of a bridge or tall building... then it could become
a great spectator sport).
• Football Hopscotch. You have to play on the fifty yard-line during Monday-night football. Whoever has won the most Hopscotch games by the end of the football game
wins. Players must pretend they don’t see the football game.
• You get to make a rule every time you get two successful points in a row.
• Play on ice.
• Dizzy-Hopscotch. Add way for opponents to have an opportunity to spin you before
you hop.
• All players play at the same time on a wide board. It’s a race.
• Each player has an apple. If you toss your stone and miss your square, take a bite of
the apple. If you finish the apple, you get to advance one square. Get a new apple.
• Gambling. Play with quarters instead of a rock. All quarters remain where they lie,
i.e. – each toss costs you a quarter. Winner gets to keep the money on the ground/
floor.
• When hopping, hop to the far end with an empty glass, stand on one foot and fill it
from a punch bowl, and hop back. If the turn is successful, your opponent has to
drink whatever is left in the glass.
• Infinite-Hopscotch. Draw the Hopscotch board in a gigantic loop. Everyone hops
around the board at once, spread out, some in the opposite direction. Jumpers have
hard hats with a ball Velcroed to the top. Have one or two kids riding bikes around
with plastic bats. If they swing and hit the ball off your hat, you’re out.

In the end, I had 61 ideas spread across 3 pages of bullet points. That felt about right for
Hopscotch. Larger games could fill far more pages of ideas.
And yes, some of the ideas are unrealistic. It’s important to put everything interesting
that comes to mind down on paper, regardless of how insane it may be. Otherwise, you’re
cutting your imagination off. Ludicrous ideas can lead to some excellent, perfectly reasonable ones.
