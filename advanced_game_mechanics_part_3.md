violent conflict, and eventually a technology and production race to space. The
Civilization setup causes all these strategies and game phases to emerge quite naturally from its mechanics.

Civilization Gameplay phases Vs. historical periods
and Golden aGes
in Civilization, your civilization will evolve through a number of historical periods in
the game. it starts in a classical period and eventually will grow into a medieval period,
renaissance, and modern period. The game uses these periods to keep the graphics and
representation of your civilization in tune with your progress. The triggers that cause
you to move into a new period are rather arbitrary. They don’t emerge from the game
mechanics as the different strategic phases of exploration, development, and conflict
do. The historical periods are a fairly superficial addition that provides visual color; they
aren’t emergent game phases.
a golden age, a mechanism that can trigger a 20-turn span of increased production for
your civilization, falls somewhere in between a gameplay phase and a historical period.
The events that trigger a golden age are nearly as arbitrary as the triggers for the historical periods. however, the player does have more control over these events and can aim
to trigger a golden age on purpose. Golden ages do not emerge from the gameplay but
do affect the gameplay phase.

N OT E We use the
word structures to refer
to the various ways that
a game designer can
set up game mechanics
to influence or control
one another. a feedback loop is a structure,
for example, and so is
a trigger that sets off
an event when certain
conditions are met.

Imagine that you are asked to design the mechanics for a game like Civilization.
How would you approach that task? You will probably have to design and tune the
mechanics over many different iterations and prototypes. If you are clever, you keep
all the elements as simple as possible, but you create several relationships among
them. In that way, you can be sure that the game will be complex, but that is little
guarantee that interesting gameplay will emerge. To get it right, you will need to be
aware of the structure of these mechanics. Some structures will cause more emergent
behavior than others. Structures like feedback loops in the game mechanics are a
good way of creating emergent behaviors, especially if this feedback operates on different scales and at different speeds. Right now, this will probably sound somewhat
vague. In this and later chapters, we will explore these structures and feedback in
much more detail.

Games of Progression
Despite the importance of emergence in games, no professional game designer can
ignore the mechanics of progression. Many games contain a story to drive the gameplay, often told over the course of many levels. Individual levels typically have clearly
defined missions that set the player’s goals and structure the tasks they must complete to finish the level. The designer should plan the game and its levels in such
a way that the game creates a coherent experience for the player. Often this means

emerGence and PrOGressiOn

31

that designers use various mechanics to control how players can move through a
game. In this book, we call such mechanics mechanics of progression. Understanding
the mechanics of progression is key to designing games with great levels and games
with interesting interactive stories.

The topic of stories and games has been the subject of fierce debates between two different camps within the field of game studies. One camp, the narratologists, put games
in the tradition of other storytelling media, and they focus on the storytelling aspects of
games. The other camp, the ludologists, argue that to understand games you should start
by looking at the game mechanics and the gameplay first and foremost. For the ludologists, game stories are not an integral part of games. Angry Birds is a good example.
The game has a story, but the story is told only between levels, and the events within a
level aren’t part of it. The story and the gameplay have no effect on one another. in the
case of Angry Birds, the ludologists are right, but there are also games that make an
effort to integrate their gameplay with their stories—role-playing and adventure games,
in particular. When we talk about storytelling in games, we mean integrated stories that
provide more than just a superficial context for the gameplay.

The mechanics of progression are an important aspect of designing game levels.
They are a key instrument for the designer to dictate what game elements players
will encounter first, what resources they will start with, and what tasks they must
perform to proceed. As a game designer, you decide what abilities the player has,
and use the layout of a level, including the clever placement of locks, keys, and vital
power-ups, to control the player’s progress through the game. This way, players are
eased into the game. As players explore the game’s space and gain abilities and skill,
they will eventually have a storylike experience that consists of the events that take
place in the level, clues discovered throughout the game, or cut-scenes that are triggered at certain locations.

Tutorials
Game designers apply the mechanics of progression to create tutorials and level
designs to train the player in the skills necessary to complete a game. These days,
the number of rules, interface elements, and gameplay options of a modern retail
video game is usually larger than most players can grasp at once. Even smaller games
found on the Internet frequently require the player to learn a multitude of rules, to
recognize many different objects, and to try different strategies. Exposing a player to
all these at the same time can result in an overwhelming experience, and players will
quickly leave the game in favor of others. The best way to deal with these problems
is to design the levels in a way that teaches the player the rules in easy-to-handle
chunks. In early tutorial levels, players are allowed to experiment with the gameplay
options in a safe and controlled environment, where errors have few consequences.

narratiVe architecture
Using tutorials and level design to train the player illustrates one of the strengths of video
games: They can use the game’s simulated physical space to structure player experience.
Unlike literature or cinema, which are well suited to depict events in time, games are
well suited to depict space. in his paper “Game design as narrative architecture” (2004),
henry Jenkins calls this type of spatial storytelling technique narrative architecture and
places games in the tradition of spatial stories, an honor they share with traditional
myths and heroes’ quests as well as modern works by J.r.r. Tolkien (2004). simply by
traveling through the game space, a story is told.

Storytelling in Games
Many games have used storytelling to great effect. The Half-Life series stands out
as a particularly good example. The games from this series are first-person shooter
action games in which the player traverses a virtual world that seems to be vast but
which in reality is confined to a narrow path. The whole story of Half-Life is told
within the game. There are no cut-scenes that take the player out of the game, all
dialogue is performed by characters inside the game, and the player can choose to
listen or ignore them altogether. Half-Life has perfected the art of guiding the player
through the game, creating a well-structured experience for him. The practice is
often referred to as railroading; in this light, it is probably no coincidence that in
Half-Life and Half-Life 2 the player arrives on a train (see Figure 2.2). The disadvantage of railroading is that the player’s freedom is mostly an illusion. When players
go in a direction that was not intended by the game, the illusion can break down
very quickly. It takes a lot of design skill to prevent players from noticing the invisible boundaries that prevent the player from exploring in other directions.
Creating interactive stories for games is not easy. Traditional techniques such as using
branching story trees have proven inefficient. You have to create a lot of content the
player will not experience in a single play-through. Creating vast open worlds for
the player to explore, as is often the case in many of the Elder Scrolls games, offers
much freedom to the player but often means that the players lose track of the main
storyline altogether. To create a coherent, storylike game, a delicate balance between
offering players freedom and restricting their freedom through the design of your
levels is required.

example: The Legend of Zelda
Almost all the games and levels in the Legend of Zelda series are good examples
of games of progression. To give a detailed example of how progression works in
games, let’s examine the Forest Temple level in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.
In this level, the player, controlling the game’s main character Link, sets out to
rescue eight monkeys from an evil presence that has infested an old temple in
the forest. The mission consists of the player freeing eight monkeys, defeating the
mini-boss (the misguided monkey king Ook), and finding and mastering the “gale
boomerang” before finally defeating the level boss (the Twilit Parasite Diababa).
Figure 2.3 displays the Forest Temple level map. Figure 2.4 summarizes the player’s
tasks and their interrelation in a graph. To reach the goal, Link needs to confront
the level boss in a final fight. To get to that fight, Link must find a key and rescue
four monkeys, for which he needs the gale boomerang, for which he needs to defeat
the monkey king, and so on. Some tasks can be executed in a different order: It does
not really matter in what order Link liberates the monkeys. Other tasks are optional
but lead to useful rewards.

Zelda is not a pure Game oF proGression

The mission structure for the Forest Temple level has a few striking features. One
is the bottleneck formed by the fight with the mini-boss and the retrieval of the
boomerang halfway through the mission and the two sections of parallel options
before and after the bottleneck. The game space features a hub-and-spoke layout
(see the “Hub-and-Spoke Layout in Zelda Games” sidebar) that supports the parallel
tasks of the mission structure. From the central hall (where the big spider is fought),
the player can go in three directions. The pathway that leads to the right quickly
branches into three more pathways. Three pathways lead to captured monkeys and
one to the mini-boss. The last pathway is open to Link only after he has freed the
first four monkeys. After the player has retrieved the gale boomerang, he can reach
additional spaces in the first hub-and-spoke structure and a new hub.

hub-and-spoke layout in Zelda Games
The dungeons of Zelda games are frequently arranged in a hub-and-spoke layout. One
central room in the dungeon acts as a hub. From this location the player can venture
into different parts of the dungeon: the spokes. Players frequently return to the hub after
completing a particular task in a spoke. The advantages of a hub-and-spoke layout are
that it lets players choose which tasks to complete first (and lets them choose a new one
if the first one they try is too difficult), and hubs are good locations for save points or
dungeon entrances. Using a hub-and-spoke layout minimizes backtracking through areas
players have already seen. For a more detailed discussion on the hub-and-spoke layout
technique, refer to chapter 12 of Fundamentals of Game Design.

The gale boomerang itself is a good example of the lock and key mechanisms typical
of the series. This is used in many action-adventure games, as Ashmore and Nietsche
observed in their paper “The Quest in a Generated World” (2007). Lock and key
mechanisms are one way to translate strong prerequisites in a mission into spatial
constructions that enforce the relationships between tasks. The boomerang is both a
weapon and a key that can be used in different ways. It has the capability to activate
switches operated by wind. Link needs to operate these switches to control a few
turning bridges to give him access to new areas. To get to the master key that unlocks

ChAptEr 2

all games in the Legend of Zelda series combine mechanics of progression with emergent gameplay. combat, for example, features a lot of emergent mechanics in which
the players must learn and master many different fighting techniques and discover for
themselves which strategy works best against what enemy. as already noted, pure games
of progression are quite rare these days. however, the Legend of Zelda games do include
strong mechanics of progression: They have cleverly designed levels and a long story line
to structure the gameplay experience. as such, it is a prime example of progression in
games.

36

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

the door to the final room with the level boss, he must use the boomerang to activate
four switches in the correct order. At the same time, the boomerang can be used to
collect distant objects (it has the power to pick up small items and creatures) and
can be used as a weapon. This allows the designer to place elements of the second
half of the mission (after the mini-boss has been defeated) in the same space that is
used for the first half of the mission. This means players will initially run into obstacles they cannot overcome until they have found the right key—the boomerang.

discrete mechanics in Zelda Games
Zelda games mix discrete mechanics with continuous mechanics for physics. space in
Zelda is continuous, as are most physical challenges. however, a great many mechanics
in Zelda are discrete. The hearts on the health bar and the damage done by Link and his
enemies are discrete: a particular enemy will always cause the same damage to you, and
you will be able to defeat that enemy with a constant number of hits with your sword.
Likewise, the mechanics controlling progression are all discrete as well. You require a
small key to unlock a door, a particular number of monkeys to help you past a gap, and
so on.

N OT E We do not
have space to discuss
the hero’s journey
story-pattern in more
detail here, but there
are many resources
to guide you if you are
interested in learning
more about it. One
of the more popular
works is christopher
vogler’s book, The
Writer’s Journey:
Mythic Structure for
Writers (1998).

Using this particular layout and lock and key elements, the Forest Temple level in
The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is structured to generate play trajectories that
feel like heroic tales. When Link enters the temple, he receives a challenge to adventure as he finds the first of eight monkeys he needs to liberate. Shortly after this, he
encounters a large spider guarding the first hub in the level. Defeating this spider
grants access to many locations in the first part of the level. What follows are many
tests and obstacles, during which the hero Link meets new friends and enemies.
Halfway through the level, Link confronts the monkey king, but there is a twist in
the plot as he discovers that the monkey king is not his major adversary after all. He
escapes with a magic item, the gale boomerang, which unlocks the second part of
the dungeon and helps him defeat his real adversary in a final climactic battle. Just
as the same structure—the hero’s journey—never seems to grow stale for fairy tales
and adventure films, this structure can be found in many of Link’s adventures and
in many other games as well.
Each enemy, trigger, or lock serves as a simple mechanism to control access to the
next part of the story. Designing games of progression involves careful planning.
Remember that the physical layout of your level and the location of key items inside
it are your most important tools to control how players progress. You should use
these elements to create a smooth and coherent experience for the players. At the
same time, you must make sure that your players have had a chance to learn and
practice the skills required to complete a level, but most of all make sure that they
enjoy their own progress by letting them overcome obstacles that they were initially
unable to defeat.

To understand the difference between progression and emergence a little better,
let’s look at the structure of the mechanics that create the two different types of
gameplay. Games of emergence are characterized by only a few rules. In a game of
emergence, complexity is created by many connections and interactions between the
rules, rather than large numbers of rules. What is interesting with this type of game
is that the complexity of the gameplay leaps up after reaching a certain point in
the complexity of the rules. We already saw a similar jump in gameplay complexity
in the discussion of tic-tac-toe and Connect Four. Figure 2.5 illustrates that turning
point, which we refer to as the complexity barrier. Beyond a certain point, interactions among the rules create an effect that is sometimes called the explosion of the
probability space. In general, mechanisms that contribute to emergence in games add
many different possible states to the game. Large probability spaces make games
more replayable; as a player, you can be confident no two games will be exactly
alike. This adds to a game’s appeal, especially if the outcome of each play-through is
as unpredictable as the first.

FIGURe 2.5
The complexity barrier
is the region between
the two dotted lines.

Games of progression usually possess many rules but far fewer interactions among
the rules. The mechanics that control player progress through a level hardly interact with similar mechanisms in the game. Many of the mechanisms serve a single
purpose: to keep players from reaching a certain place until they have accomplished
some other task first. In effect, these mechanisms can be in one of two simple states:
A door can be open or closed, a key can be found or not. Mechanisms that contribute to progression rarely add many different states to the game, but they are easily
controlled by the game designer. The advantage of progression is that the designer
can dictate the order in which players will face challenges and learn skills and can

ChAptEr 2

Structural Differences

38

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

integrate constantly increasing challenges into an overarching story line. The overall experience is much easier to design in a game of progression than it is in a game
of emergence.
The shape of the probability space generated by typical mechanics of emergence and
mechanics of progression is quite different. Games of emergence have a probability
space that is large and wide, because the game presents players with many options,
and the game’s direction is often subject to factors outside the player’s direct control
(such as die-rolling). In contrast, the probability space of games of progression tends
to be small but deep. For a designer, it is easier to create a sequence of many gameplay choices—but with fewer options at each decision point—and still have a good
idea of, and control over, the possible outcomes. This is why games of progression
are usually longer than games of emergence and can deliver coherent stories. Games
of emergence, such as checkers, tend to be shorter. In a long game of emergence,
you run the risk that the player will make a small mistake early on that makes the
game unwinnable hours later—a design flaw. X-COM: UFO Defense, although an
excellent game in many respects, exhibited this property.
The mechanics of emergence are efficient at creating a large probability space. The
mechanics that control progression do the opposite, restricting the probability space
by limiting the number of options that players have at any one time—they cannot
proceed until a particular problem is solved. As a designer, the mechanics of progression allow you to carefully structure the player’s experience and deliver a well-told
story. They also enable you to control the difficulty of the game so that players do
not encounter challenges for which they are not yet prepared. Table 2.1 summarizes
these differences.

Although emergence and progression are considered two different ways of creating
challenges in games, many games have elements of both. By integrating emergence
and progression, designers strive to combine the best of both worlds: freedom and
openness of play through emergence and the structured storylike experience through
progression. Progression is normally used for storytelling, but it is difficult to create
a coherent plot if the player has great freedom of action, as in emergent games. In
practice, these generally alternate: An emergent level or mission unlocks a little story
progress between levels, followed by another emergent level, and so on. The Grand
Theft Auto games provide good examples. In those games, players may achieve victory
in a mission by a wide variety of means, but their gameplay choices don’t really
affect the story; it occurs only between missions. So far, not many games have succeeded in integrating the two different structures so that players experience them
simultaneously. There are many reasons for this:
Video games are still a relatively young medium. No one can expect all these
problems to be solved already.

n

As Noah Wardrip-Fruin argues (see the “A Mismatch in the Mechanics of Games
and Stories” sidebar), there is a disparity between the level of sophistication of the
mechanics of progression and emergence: Mechanics of emergence have evolved
much further and quicker in the past years than mechanics of progression have.

n

In the past, the lack of solid formal theory of what game mechanics are and how
they are structured made it difficult to approach such problems. One of the goals
of this book is to present a methodological approach to designing game mechanics
and to use this method to deal with these sorts of problems.

n

In addition, in the short history of video games there are a few interesting examples
of games that have come up with ways to combine the two structures. Let’s take a
look at one of the more recent examples.

a mismatch in the mechanics oF Games and stories
in his book Expressive Processing (2009), noah Wardrip-Fruin observes that the mechanics
that govern a game’s interactive story have not evolved as much as the mechanics to
handle movement, combat, and other aspects of the game’s (physics) simulation. simulation
mechanics are currently very evolved and detailed, but the player’s progress through a
story is simply tracked by setting up a few bottlenecks or gates to act as milestones. Once
the player fulfills the task associated with a milestone, the story advances. as Wardrip-Fruin
argues, the underlying shape of these story progression mechanics is not as interesting
as the underlying shape of the mechanics of the rest of the game.

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

example: From StarCraft to StarCraft 2
The original version of StarCraft is an excellent example of a game of emergence.
StarCraft helped define the real-time strategy genre. Like Civilization, the individual
game elements are fairly simple, but there are many interrelationships among them,
setting up a system of game mechanics that has many interesting emergent properties. During the single-player campaign, you play through 30 missions, which
nearly all have you build a base, manage your resources, and construct and upgrade
an attack force before obliterating your opponents. The progression within a single
StarCraft level is almost always the same, and because it is predictable, a given level
does not feel very storylike.
StarCraft also tells a story around the levels. In many ways, it is a good example of
storytelling in games, with a narrative that is more dramatic than most games of its
time. In fact, its storyline follows a structure similar to a classical tragedy, which is
definitely rare in games. However, the story is only a framing device around the
core gameplay. The player’s performance and choices have no impact on the plot,
apart from the fact that the player must complete missions to advance the story.
The story provides context and motivation for the game but is not an integrated
part of the gameplay.
When StarCraft 2 came out, more than a decade later, the story and its integration
into the game was probably the biggest change. StarCraft 2 changed little about the
core mechanics of the original game. You can still build a base, manage resources,
and construct and upgrade your force. However, the missions of the single-player
campaign are much more varied than they were in the original game. For example,
in the level “The Devil’s Playground,” the lower areas of the play field are periodically submerged in lava, destroying everything that is caught there (see Figure 2.6).
The mission’s objective is not to defeat an enemy base but to survive under these
harsh conditions and harvest a number of resources in the meantime. This creates
a different rhythm and progression from those of the typical missions in the original
version of StarCraft. Another good example is the earlier mission called “The
Evacuation.” In this mission, it is your objective to protect a number of civilian
colonists as they try to escape a planet overrun by aliens. To this end, you need to
escort four caravans of civilians trying to break through to the safety of a nearby
spaceport. You will build a base and an attack force but in this case, to protect the
route and civilians. Again, this creates a different play experience from the typical
StarCraft mission. In the single-player campaign of StarCraft 2, it is rare to find a
mission that progresses through the typical stages of the missions of the original
game. No longer can you simply build your base, carefully explore the map, and
attack enemy bases one by one. In StarCraft 2, you find yourself pressed by events
and scenarios that were predesigned—a classic progression mechanic. As a result,
the missions are much more varied and engaging, forcing players to adapt their
strategies and common patterns of play to new circumstances all the time. Because
they are not repetitive, they feel more storylike.

In StarCraft 2, the player has more control over the larger story line of the game. To
a certain extent, players can choose the order of missions and sometimes can choose
between two options. Although this integrates the overall storyline into the game
slightly better than the original StarCraft did, it is not as sophisticated as the integration between progression and emergence on the level of the individual mission.

Summary
In this chapter, you explored the categories of games of emergence and games of
progression. These categories are frequently used in game studies to indicate two
alternative ways of creating gameplay and challenges in games. There seems to be a
tendency within game studies and among certain game designers to favor games of
emergence over games of progression. This tendency can be attributed to the more
interesting structure of the mechanics that create emergence in games and the size
of the possibility space created by mechanics of emergence.
Games of emergence are characterized by relatively few rules, many interrelated
game elements, and a large and wide possibility space. Games of progression are
characterized by relatively many rules, fewer interrelation between game elements,
and a smaller possibility space that is usually narrow and deep.

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

Modern video games include elements from both games of emergence and games
of progression. However, integrating emergence and progression so that the player
experiences both at once is not straightforward. It requires keen insight in the
structure of the mechanics that create them. In this book, we will teach you a more
structured method for looking at mechanics. In the later chapters, we will return to
the integration of emergence and progressions and use these methods to shed new
light on the problem of integrating them.

Complex systems
and the structure of
Emergence

ChAptEr 3

In the first chapter, we explained how gameplay emerges from the game’s mechanics. In Chapter 2, “Emergence and Progression,” we showed that the mechanics of
games of emergence possess a particular structure in which relatively simple rules
create many different gameplay situations. In general, this also means that a game
of emergence has a high replay value. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between emergence, the structure of game mechanics, and gameplay in more
detail. We will see that for gameplay to emerge from them, the mechanics must be
balanced between order and chaos. This balance is easily upset, which creates a challenge for designers. In fact, designing emergence is something of a paradoxical task,
because one of the defining aspects of emergent behavior is that it occurs only after
a system is put into motion.
Emergence is not restricted to the domain of games. There are many different complex systems that display emergent behavior, and quite a few of these systems have
been studied in the past. The science of complexity, popularly known as chaos theory,
deals with emergent systems in other fields. In this chapter, we will take a look at
some of the advances from this discipline to learn more about the structures of complex systems that contribute to emergent behavior. But first we will discuss in more
detail the relationship between emergence and gameplay.

Gameplay as an Emergent Property of Games
We define gameplay as the challenges that a game poses to a player and the actions
the player can perform in the game. Most actions enable the player to overcome
challenges, although a few actions (such as changing the color of a racing car or
chatting) may not be related to challenges. The actions that are related to challenges
are governed by the game mechanics. An avatar can jump only when a jumping
mechanic has been implemented in the game, for example.

43

44

Game mechanics: advanced Game desiGn

It’s possible to program the game in such a way that every challenge has one unique
action that overcomes it. As we discussed in the previous chapter, classic games of
progression, such as text-adventure games, work this way—each challenge is a unique
puzzle, and each puzzle has a unique action that solves it. However, we also argued
that in most games at least some of the actions and challenges are created differently.
In Tetris, nobody programmed in all the possible combinations and sequences of
falling tetrominoes (Tetris blocks). The game simply releases tetrominoes at random.
In Tetris, the challenge is created by a combination of a random sequence of tetrominoes and the player’s previous actions in dealing with them. This combination is
different every time, and players have some level of control over the challenges they
face. The game requires very few actions to deal with the infinite variety of challenges
it can create. Solitaire card games do the same thing.
Other games implement mechanisms that allow players to act in unexpected ways.
In his 2001 article “The Future of Game Design,” game designer Harvey Smith discussed the need to set up game systems so that players have the opportunity to act
in a wide range of expressive ways (www.igda.org/articles/hsmith_future). To make
this possible, the game designer should move away from special-case solutions to
individual, predesigned challenges and toward simple, consistent game mechanics
that can be combined in interesting ways, even if this leads to some strange results.
Rocket jumping is one of those examples. Because an exploding rocket exerts a force
on nearby objects in most first-person shooter games, clever players have used that
extra force to jump greater heights and distances. Smith regards these emergent
player tactics not as problem but as an opportunity: He argues that more games
should be designed around the freedom and creativity that expressive systems allow.

consistency oVer realism
rocket jumping is an example of unintended, and rather weird, gameplay that is as
unrealistic as it is enjoyable. it illustrates the argument made by steven Poole in his book
Trigger Happy (2000) that in games it is more important to be consistent than to be realistic. Poole argues that to play a game is to immerse yourself into an artificial world created by game mechanics. Players do not want those mechanics to be perfectly realistic.
a realistic Formula 1 racing game, for example, would take players years of practice to
become skilled enough to race, and that wouldn’t be fun at all for most players. Players
expect all space shooter weapons to behave like the blasters in Star Wars, not like real
lasers where the beam moves at the speed of light and is invisible unless you are hit by
it. Players play games to do things that would be impossible or unsafe for them to do in
real life, and odd effects such as rocket jumps are all part of the fun. however, players
do expect game mechanics to be consistent. Players get frustrated when the mechanics
seem arbitrary, such as when a rocket can kill a tough enemy but fails to destroy a light
wooden door.

Games of emergence have a high replay value because the challenges and possible
actions that occur while playing are different every time. Every session is the unique
result of the collaboration between the game and its players. However, it is very
hard to predict whether interesting gameplay will emerge from a particular game
simply by looking at the rules. From our discussion of tic-tac-toe and Connect-Four
in the previous chapter, it should be clear that creating emergence is not simply a
matter of having many rules. The relation between the complexity of the rules and
the complexity of the game’s behavior is not linear. You cannot create a more interesting game simply by adding more rules. In fact, sometimes it is more effective to
reduce the number of rules to create a system that displays truly interesting and
emergent gameplay.

between Order and Chaos
The behavior of complex systems (see the “What Are Complex Systems?” sidebar)
can be classified as ordered to chaotic and anything in between. Ordered systems
are simple to predict, while chaotic systems are impossible to predict, even when
you fully understand the way the parts work that make up the system. Emergence
thrives somewhere between order and chaos.

When we refer to complex systems in this book, we do not mean systems that are difficult
to understand. The word complex is used here to indicate that the system consists of
many parts. as is often the case with the systems studied by the science of complexity, these parts are often quite simple to understand and to model individually. When
these parts are put together, most complex systems display surprising and unpredictable
behavior that can be difficult to explain just by looking at the parts separately. in the
scientific literature on complex systems, games are a classic example. The individual
rules of these games tend to be fairly simple and easy to understand, yet the outcome of
a game is unpredictable. in this book, we explore in detail the relationship between the
individual parts of a game and the game’s overall behavior.

There are two stages between the extremes of order and chaos: periodic systems and
emergent systems (Figure 3.1). Periodic systems progress through a distinct number
of stages in an ongoing and easily predicted sequence. On a large scale, the weather
system and the cycle of seasons behave like this. Depending where you are on the
planet, you have a fixed number of seasons each year. In some areas, the rhythm
of the seasonal cycle is very strict, and a particular season will start almost on the
same day every year. Despite some variance in seasonal temperatures and the date
when seasons start, the weather system is mostly in balance and progresses through
the same cycle over and over again. (Global warming appears to be changing the

weather system at the moment, but there is considerable debate about whether it is
a permanent change or part of a very long cycle.)

FIGURe 3.1
Four categories of
behavior of complex
systems

Emergent systems are less ordered and more chaotic than periodic systems. Emergent
systems often display stable patterns of behavior, but the system might switch from
one pattern to another suddenly and unpredictably. The weather system is a good
example. Although the cycle of seasons has overall norms in a particular area, predicting the weather for a particular year is difficult. The date of the next hard frost
or the amount of snow in winter is nearly impossible to predict accurately because
of the complex interactions of pressure systems, ocean temperature, and air temperature. It is still possible to make assumptions and create rules of thumb based upon
statistical norms, such as “plant peas on Good Friday,” but these will not be reliable
in every year.

experiencinG emerGence in a simple experiment
You can experience the four categories of complex behavior through a simple experiment. all you need is a water tap (although this experiment works better with some
taps than with others). When you open a water tap very gently, at one point it will start
dripping drops of water at a slow, regular pace. sometimes it is easier to reach this
state by opening the tap and then gently closing it. a closed tap is an easily predictable,
ordered behavior: no water flows. a dripping tap is in a periodic state. now, when you
gently open the tap further, it will start dripping faster and faster. however, at a certain
point, not very long before you get a full stream of water, the pattern of water flow will
become irregular. at this stage, you are moving the system quickly toward a chaotic state.
somewhere in between the chaos and periodic dripping you might be able to get more
complicated periodic patterns, such as two quick successive drips followed by a longer
pause. sometimes the tap will alternate between fast drips and a slow, irregular trickle.
Opening the tap further will quickly push the tap state back to a steady, ordered flow
of water.

In games, we can recognize patterns of behavior, and in many games we can recognize multiple patterns at the same time. Games of progression are ordered systems,
because all possible sequences of challenges and actions are predesigned. Although
the player cannot know what will happen next, a designer looking at the mechanics can determine it with certainty. In board games, taking turns creates a periodic
system but with more subtlety. The discrete unit of time (ticks) used in most massively
multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) affects the strategies of players.
The distinct development phases in Sid Meier’s Civilization (expansion, consolidation,
war, colonization, and the race to space) are clear examples of emergent behavior in
games. Finally, dice or random number generators, and other players, introduce a
chaotic element into games. To design an emergent game, the designer must ensure
that all these elements balance one another in such a way that the game’s overall
behavior falls somewhere in the emergence category.

Can emergence be Designed?

Normally we think of design as a process in which the designer knows what she
wants to produce and works to create it. Designing emergent systems is paradoxical
because designers may not know exactly what final state their system will produce
but will be designing the experience of getting there. However, as we explained in
Chapter 1, “Designing Game Mechanics,” certain structures in a game’s mechanics
will tend to produce particular types of results. Understanding these structures helps
designers create the effects they want, even if the process still requires a lot of testing.
This book is all about identifying these structures, recognizing them in your (and
others’) games, and leveraging them to produce the gameplay you want.
Before we set our focus back on games in the following chapters, let’s take a look at
a few classic examples from the science of complexity.

Structural Qualities of Complex Systems
The science of complexity typically concerns itself with vast, complex systems. The
weather system is the classic example. In these systems, a small change can have
large effects over time. This is popularly known as the butterfly effect: A butterfly
that flaps its wings on one side of the planet might hypothetically trigger a motion
of air that accumulates into a hurricane on the far side of the planet. Other systems
studied by the science of complexity include stock markets, traffic, pedestrian flow,
the flocking of birds, and the motion of astronomical objects. These systems are

Emergence can occur in complex systems only after they have been set in motion.
This explains why game design depends heavily on building prototypes and testing
the game. Games are complex systems, and the only way to find out whether the
gameplay is interesting, enjoyable, and balanced is to have people play the game in
some form.

typically far more complex than the systems found in games. Luckily, there are also
many other, simpler systems that also display emergent behavior. It is easier to study
these systems and try to distill from them the relevant structural qualities that contribute to emergent behavior.

Active and Interconnected Parts
At the boundary of mathematics, computer science, and games lies a peculiar field
that studies cellular automata (the plural of cellular automaton). A cellular automaton is a simple set of rules governing the appearance of spaces, or cells, in a line or
on a grid. Each cell may be either black or white. The rules determine what causes a
cell to change from black to white (or vice versa) and how the color of a cell influences the cells around it. Normally the rules for changing a cell’s color only take
into account the cell’s current color and those of its eight immediate neighbors (on
a two-dimensional grid) or its two immediate neighbors (on a line).
Mathematicians think of such a collection of rules as a hypothetical machine that
operates by itself without human intervention. This is why they are called automata.
A cellular automaton starts with its cells in a given configuration (some white, some
black) and then applies the rules to each cell to determine whether its color should
change. It does not change a cell immediately; it checks every cell in the grid first,
marks the ones to be changed, and then changes them all before the next iteration.
Then it repeats the process. Each iteration is called a generation.
British scientist Stephen Wolfram has created a simple cellular automaton that
exhibits emergent behavior. It uses a line of cells. The state (or color) of each cell
is determined by the previous state of that cell and its two immediate neighbors.
Because cells have only two possible states, black and white, this creates eight possible combinations. Figure 3.2 displays one set of possible rules (on the bottom)
and the resulting, surprisingly complex pattern that is created by printing each new
generation of the system under the previous one. It begins with one black cell and
all the rest white.
The images at the bottom of the figure state the rules for converting the color of a
cell. The leftmost rule means “If a black cell is surrounded by black cells on either
side, in the next generation, the cell will turn white.” The fourth rule means “If a
white cell has a black cell on its left side only, in the next generation, the white cell
will turn black.”
Notice that even though there is nothing random in the rules, this cellular automaton produces a pattern with distinctive and apparently random features.

Wolfram described his work in detail in his book A New Kind of Science (2002).
His extensive study has revealed three critical qualities of systems that exhibit
dynamic behavior:
They must consist of simple cells whose rules are defined locally. This means
the system must consist of parts that can be describe relatively easily in isolation.
In Wolfram’s cellular automaton example, eight simple rules determine the behavior
of each individual cell.

n

The system must allow for long-range communication. Changes in the state of
a single part of the complex system must be able to cause changes in parts distant
in space or time. Long-range communication is what makes the butterfly effect
possible. In Wolfram’s cellular automaton, communication between parts takes
place because each cell directly influences its immediate neighbors. Because those
neighbors also have neighbors, each cell is indirectly connected to every other cell
in the system.

The level of activity of the cells is a good indicator for the complexity of the
behavior of the system. In a system that has only a very few active cells, interesting,
complex behavior is unlikely to emerge. In Wolfram’s automaton, activity is understood as changes to a cell’s state: A cell is active when it changes from black to white
or from white to black.

n

Interestingly, some of these qualities can be ”read” from the rules that govern each
cell’s behavior. The fact that each cell takes input from itself and two neighbors
indicates that there is a good chance at long-range communication: All the cells are
connected. In addition, four of the eight rules in Figure 3.2 cause the cell to change
its color, which indicates that there probably is going to be a fair amount of activity
in the system.
Cellular automata show us that the threshold for complexity is surprisingly low.
Relatively simple rules can give rise to complex behavior, as long as there are enough
parts, activity, and connections. Most games are built in a similar way. Games
consist of many different elements that are governed by fairly simple mechanics.
Usually there are many possible interactions between the individual game elements.
Obviously, the player is an important source of activity within the system, but as
cellular automata show, emergence can take place even without human input.
Tower defense games illustrate these properties well (Figure 3.3). Tower defense
games consist of a number of relatively simple parts. Enemies follow a predesigned
path toward the player’s fortress. Each enemy has a particular speed, a number of
hit points, and perhaps a few attributes to make it more interesting. The player
places towers to defend his position. Each tower fires projectiles at enemies within
a certain range and at a certain rate. Some towers deal damage while others produce
other effects, such as slowing enemies down. Sometimes towers will boost the performance of neighboring towers. In a tower defense game, there are many elements
defined by local mechanisms (enemies and towers). Like cellular automata, these
elements are active (enemies move, towers respond to enemies) and interconnected
(towers shoot at enemies, towers can boost each other’s performance).
The level of activity and the number of connections between elements are good
indicators that can be used to distinguish games of emergence from games of progression. In a typical game of progression, all elements (puzzles, characters, and so
on) interact only with the player’s avatar and not with each other, and they become
active only when they are on the screen. The elements not currently visible on the
screen in a game of progression are usually inactive. Similarly, the number of connections among the elements is low. Game elements can interact only in a limited
number of predesigned ways. Obviously, this gives the designer a lot of control over
the events in a game of progression, but, as we have shown in the previous chapter,
it also results in more predictable games that cease to be fun when all the predesigned
options have been explored.

Feedback loops Can Stabilize or Destabilize a System
Ecosystems are another classic example of complex systems. Ecosystems seem to be
quite well balanced: The various animal populations within an ecosystem do not
change much over time. What’s more, nature seems to include all sorts of mechanisms to maintain this balance. This is best explained by looking at predator and
prey populations. When there are many prey, the predators will find food easily.
This will cause their number to increase. However, as more and more predators survive, the prey population will decrease. At a certain point, there will be too many
predators, and the situation reverses: Now the predators won’t find enough food,
and their population will decrease. Because there are fewer predators, more prey will
