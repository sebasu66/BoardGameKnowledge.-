komi in return for going second.16 In computer games, simultaneous play is usually
possible, so asymmetry in board position is often the main concern in games that are
close to symmetrical. In RTS games, for example, a common approach is to have slight
asymmetry for aesthetic reasons, but to make the positions as symmetrical as possible
otherwise (although in games with different races, the remarks above on extreme
asymmetry apply to the choice of race).
If the game is short (or has short atoms), playing multiple times is an easy way
to relieve the asymmetry. Note that atoms can have a very marked asymmetry even
when the game is relatively symmetric (e.g., bridge and football, where there’s an
offense and a defense at any given moment). For any game, even a longer game
without short atoms, say chess, asymmetries can be handled from a metagame point
of view by the campaign, within which enough games take place to wash out positional advantages.
Sports and Equipment
One special kind of asymmetry, akin to that of the extreme asymmetry seen in games
like Magic or Everquest but to a lesser degree, is the asymmetry found in sports equipment. In sports it is generally accepted that players or teams may bring their own
equipment within some limitations. (In other game genres this is not entirely accepted,
and some people object to games like Magic as a result. Another common point of
view is that equipment obtained entirely in-game, such as through normal play in an
MMRPG, is acceptable but that purchased equipment is not.) In many sports, the
positional advantage obtained through equipment is minor (e.g., basketball, athletic
shoe commercials to the contrary), but in some (e.g., bicycle racing, Formula 1) it’s
quite large. Stock-car racing (and, more recently, showroom stock racing) was initially
in effect a rule modification to auto racing that limited the positional advantage due
to equipment. Magic sealed-deck play is a similar development.
Further Examples
Almost every game has at least some amount of asymmetry, usually with advantages
accruing to players in certain positions.
Chess Going first provides a massive advantage at high and roughly equal skill levels,
and is generally washed out otherwise.

Bridge A full rubber of bridge is fairly symmetric. But players do bring a bidding
system to the table, which can be thought of as like a Magic deck or an RPG character.
During bidding, order matters a great deal (the same bid can mean something quite
different in first seat versus fourth seat). When the play of the hand begins, the positions are highly asymmetric: one player (dummy) is out entirely, and another (declarer)
is extremely powerful compared to the remaining two (the defenders).
Hearts In a game with players of varying skill levels, two players of equal skill may
find themselves in asymmetric positions based on their positioning relative to the
weaker players and to each other.
Poker Both the order of player action and the particular qualities and personalities
of the other players might suit two otherwise equally skilled players in different ways.
So in terms of positional asymmetry poker is much like hearts.
Scrabble Going first is a relatively modest advantage. Position compared to other
players (in multiplayer) is, however, very important. In particular, going right after a
weak player is extremely useful, because that player is more likely to give you good
opportunities to score.
Most sports The home-field advantage is small but significant. Advantages in order
of play range from nonexistent (basketball and hockey have symmetric starts) or
modest (each team has one kick-off at the start of a half in football) to extreme (going
second in baseball is very good, because you can react to what the other team has
done; since this is tied in with home-field advantage, it’s hard to untangle the two).
The pure in-game advantages of these asymmetries, however, can be washed out by
asymmetries from outside the game (e.g., the effects of crowd noise).
Races In most races, initial positioning is fairly important. Indeed, in auto racing
there is even a term—pole position—given to the preferred starting position. Many
races, especially shorter ones, have staggered starts to attempt to make up for the differences in starting positions. If the race is long enough, a marathon for example, any
initial advantage may be largely washed out. Further positional advantages may arise
from equipment (see above).
Single-player games When discussing single-player computer games, we mentioned
that some of them felt like “pure” one-player games (e.g., Tetris), and others seemed
like “one and a half” player games (e.g., Starcraft vs. the AI). With the language of
positional asymmetry, we can phrase this more precisely: thinking of the computer as
another player, a high degree of asymmetry means we have a “pure” one-player game,
and a high degree of symmetry means we have a one and a half player game.

Characteristic: Sensory Feedback

Playing a game is not just the meeting of an abstract human brain with an abstract
set of gameplay algorithms. The game’s conceit is one reflection of that; the interface
and aesthetics of a game are another. The game provides visual, tactile, and audio
information to the player (but rarely taste or smell), and the player inputs her choices
to the game somehow, whether it be by leaping to catch a ball, telling her opponent

Infrastructure

97

her letter choice in ghost, picking up a chess piece and moving it, or group selecting
RTS units with a mouse. This flow to and from the user is extremely important for
any game, regardless of genre, and it can be good or bad for the game depending on
how it is done.
Note that there are really two axes on which to measure the sensory feedback a
game has: how aesthetically pleasing it is, in and of itself, and to what extent it supports or inhibits gameplay. Aesthetic appeal and support of gameplay can sometimes
work against each other—to grossly oversimplify, aesthetic considerations often push
for a greater ornateness, and gameplay wants simplicity of interface. Examples of this
tension include fancy versus simple chess pieces, spare versus decorative cardface
designs in a TCG, 3-D zoomed-in versus isometric pulled-back views in an RTS, and
spartan versus ornate buttons and controls in a computer game. Thus in some sense
artists and game designers are natural enemies; they need to transcend this innate
opposition of concerns to get truly great results.
People tend to think of the word interface as applying to computers only, but in
the general sense in which we take it—all the ways the game sends and receives information to and from the player—every game has an interface.
Interface and aesthetics are both subjects worthy of books in their own right; we’ll
content ourselves with just a few comments and examples, organized by sense.
Visual
There is much appeal in well-done artwork in a paper game or good graphics in a
computer game (with a computer game, the artistic quality is often more important
than the technical sophistication measured by such things as polygon count17).
Examples of good visuals can be found in the following:
Playing cards The standard designs are not too busy, but they aren’t absolutely
minimalist either.
• Pokémon monster designs (say, on the GameBoy) Rather like playing cards, a nice
balance between simplicity and representation gives them an iconic character.
• Sports
Players can instantly react to the physical acts of others due to the wonder
of the interface that is real-life physics.
• Casino games
These typically have a very clean and sophisticated-looking presentation that is very good for spectation.
•

When the visuals in a game go bad, it is often because they have become too
complex, making it harder to read the game state (and thus making state heuristics
17. World of Warcraft is a fine example of this at work; most players think of it as having “great
graphics” even though, on a technical level, they are by no means cutting edge. The artistic
direction, however, is excellent. Web games are another example where one can see artistic excellence without cutting-edge technology.

more taxing to apply). The classic example of this is the fancy-themed chess set, which
may make a nice gift or conversation piece, but is usually less good to play with than
a more classic chess set. Note that this is partly a matter of standards—players are used
to the traditional pieces—but partly a matter of simplicity and cleanness of the look
of the pieces. Sometimes a game’s visuals are “upgraded” by making them more
complex, and thus actually worse; the transition in style from Pokémon to Digimon,
and the shift from art to photos in the first U.S. edition of Settlers of Catan, are examples of this.
Some cases where visuals are especially likely to obscure gameplay include
Newer games (older games have evolved a harmony between visuals and
gameplay)
• Games made with art as a focus (e.g., the decks of cards one buys in a museum, with
a different work of art pictured on each card)
• Gift items (e.g., a Simpsons chess set)
•

Computer games especially have an enormous number of issues to wrestle with.
They are newer, art is often a very large part of them, and computer interface is hard
enough already, even in applications like business software where aesthetics is not a
major consideration.
Audio
Computer games use sound very deliberately, including music, voiceover, and all kinds
of more or less naturalistic sound effects. But many physical games also gain aesthetic
value from sound, from the clinking of poker chips, the shuffling sounds of cards, the
roar of racing cars, the regular thudding of a tennis volley, to the brutal impact of
bodies colliding in boxing or football. The roar of the crowd at sporting events has
not only aesthetic value but also gameplay implications: it can affect gameplay (especially when very loud) and it can inform spectation.
It is easy to overlook the power of sound in a game. One can see evidence of it if
one plays a web game with the sound off (perhaps at work), and then again with the
sound on. Even if the game seems like “it doesn’t really need sound,” one often finds
that one unconsciously enjoys the game more with the sound.18
18. Game designers often like to think that they can judge a game’s quality even when it is in
an unpolished state—and indeed it is part of their job to be able to do so. But an honest game
designer who is paying attention can often find himself misjudging based on polish. (This same
phenomenon occurs with visual polish as well, but it’s harder to detect because one doesn’t
commonly turn visuals off and on.) It is very easy to find gameplay flaws in the no-sound
game—or to overlook them in the version with sound. This effect is particularly powerful in
games involving monkeys.

Tactile
The weight of chess pieces, the feel of shuffling and dealing cards, the tactile qualities
of poker chips—noncomputer games have always had a good deal of pleasure and
satisfaction coming from the physical feel of their components. Sports, of course, are
even more physical, although the sensations involved are both pleasant and unpleasant. Until recently, computer games have had very little tactile feedback, although
more recently force feedback joysticks, rumble packs, and special input devices like
the Dance Dance Revolution dancepad, the Guitar Hero controller, and above all the Wii
remote have begun to change this.
For another example, look at dice. Rolling dice is enjoyable to many people, and
some games, like craps, are little more than an excuse to roll dice. But rolling dice
isn’t visually alone that much fun, for example with a computer. Paper role-playing
games almost always use dice, and critical die rolls become a focus for player attention
and excitement. Perhaps because they can’t match the tactile input, computer RPGs
don’t simulate die rolling directly (although they borrow a great many other things
from paper RPGs) and instead put the random number generation behind the scenes,
probably because a direct translation of die rolling to the computer screen would be
an annoyance rather than an enjoyable feature. More recently, though, floating
combat text (where damage numbers spout up from the heads of the targets like water
bubbling from a fountain) has become more common in MMOs, notably World of
Warcraft. These numbers can be thought of as the analog to die rolling, an analog
more suited to the computer medium.
Olfactory
Although not a large part of computer games or boardgames and card games, smell is
a factor in sports. Aside from the obvious factor of the smell of humans exerting
themselves, there are outdoor smells (grass, earth, the woods after a fresh snowfall)
and the smells of animals and equipment (horses, cars, baseball gloves).
Even nonsports games may have some equipment-related smells, such as the scent
of newly opened packaging. Although the scent alone may not be that important, it
is part of an overall aesthetic appeal that can be strong for some people, especially
with games where one frequently opens new packaging: an expansion to a computer
game, or a booster pack of a trading card game.
Still, because smell in a game is rarely deliberately designed but is instead a side
effect of other decisions, there’s not as much scope for discussion as there is with the
other senses.
Taste
Taste is not commonly a factor in games, except perhaps in sports if things go drastically wrong. Some specific exceptions might include Fear Factor–style games, chocolate
Russian roulette, and drinking games.

Chapter 3

Control Feel and Kinesthetics
When you give input to a game, the game can absorb that input and incorporate it
into the game state in different ways. People can gain pleasure from the way their
interactions match or surprise their internal physics calculation engines. Sometimes
things are pretty straightforward: you pick up a chess piece and move it—although
even there the heft of the chess piece can feel better or worse. Placing stones on a go
board has a kind of tactile feedback. Playing pool, bowling, or using the Pop-o-matic
dice in Trouble all provide distinctive sensations based on how your body is interacting
with your environment.
With computer games, the most common “feel” is a sort of weightless responsiveness: click on a certain area or press a direction key, and you either go there instantly
or you head in that direction at whatever speed the game allows. But some games do
have a more distinct feel, such as the bouncing rhythms of Q*bert. So-called physics
games, from the classics Lunar Lander and Crystal Quest, to the many modern physics
games (especially common in the indie game movement) such as Armadillo Run, Bridge
Builder, Tower of Goo, Triptych, Crayon Physics, or driving a Warthog in Halo have very
strong feels.
Exercise 3.24: Before 1997 there were almost no examples of tactile feedback in
console games. After 1997 the number skyrocketed. What changed? What does this
say about the importance of this feedback?
Exercise 3.25: List the features of Monopoly that give good tactile sensations. Compare
this list to other boardgames.
Exercise 3.26: Give some examples of how sound can be critical in gameplay. Give
some examples where it hinders gameplay.

4 Games as Systems

If chapter 3 dealt with systemic ingredients of games, this chapter deals with emergent
systemic phenomena: properties of games that are more large-scale, and that typically
emerge from the rules rather than being included within them. The sections in this
chapter look at games as an abstract whole rather than looking at concrete individual
elements.
We begin with a discussion of abstract games (like rock-paper-scissors) and how
they may map onto more concrete games or parts of those games. We then discuss
the overall flow of the game: first from the point of view of the ebb and flow of victory,
whether accelerating (“snowballing”) or decelerating (“catch-up”), then from the
point of view of complexity (does the game become more complex over its course,
less complex, or does the complexity shift in some more complicated way?). Finally,
we talk about game balance, and how the strategic choice in the game—that is, the
experienced complexity of it—can collapse if the balance is wrong.
4.1

Characteristic: Abstract Subgames and Essential Games

Games are often disguised versions of other simpler games, or have other simpler
games within them. An example of the former is when one says of a political game
“it’s really just the chip-taking game.” An example of the latter is a rock-paper-scissors
relationship between units in an RTS: perhaps melee beats ranged beats flying, but
flying beats melee because the melee units can’t hit back.1 These abstract games may
be good or bad for the game in question (depending on how they are integrated into
the game, and whether they support or simply overwrite the other elements of the
game), but recognizing them is always a help for understanding the game.
1. For the computer programmers among our readers, the first case can be thought of as an “is-a”
relationship, and the second a “has-a” relationship. We might say of some game that it “is a”
chip-taking game, or that it “has a” rock-paper-scissors subgame within it.

Explicit Subgames
Sometimes a game is quite explicitly made up of distinct subgames. Mario Party and
Wario Ware are collections of minigames. In the boardgame Titan, the main game
involves traveling around the board building up an army, but when two armies fight,
a tactical subgame with its own distinct rules is fought on a separate map. In some
live-action roleplaying games2 rock-paper-scissors is used explicitly as a conflict resolution mechanic.
Games with subgames fall into three rough categories:
1. Games that contain subgames Titan, most MMOs (buying from vendors, e.g., is a
subgame), most Final Fantasy games, and many other examples.
2. Games that are subgame collections Mario Party, Cranium, Wario Ware, Barbu, dealer’s
choice poker.
3. Staged games Games that fall into stages so distinct, they are essentially different
games. Examples include bridge (bidding and play3), Magic drafting (the initial draft
of cards for your deck, followed by playing with the deck you drafted), or Skitgubbe
(accumulate cards in the trick-taking phase, then attempt to void your hand in the
rummylike phase).
There is a continuity between subgames on the one hand and metagame activities on
the other, especially with staged games. Bidding and play in bridge definitely feel like
subgames of one game. Magic drafting, Magic constructed (deckbuilding and play),
Warhammer (army selection, painting, and play), and D&D (character creation and
play) feel successively more like a game activity with an associated metagame activity.
But for any of these games, one can think of them as a (smaller) game with a pregame
activity, or a (larger) game that’s made up of subgames. Note that each of the subgames
of a given larger game will tend to have its own characteristics: length of playtime,
interactivity, costs, rewards, and so on, and thus may appeal to different parts of the
larger game audience.
Implicit Subgames
Although some games have explicit subgames, it’s more common, as in the meleeranged-flying RTS example, for the subgames to be implicit. Another example, found
in many TCGs and RTS games,4 is early-game units losing to midgame units losing to
2. Live-action role-playing games, or LARPs, are a form of role-playing game that is played while
moving about and acting out the game, rather than using a computer or playing at a table with
pencil and paper. The mobile nature of the game encourages mechanics that do not require any
special equipment.
3. Or, for a few playgroups, three phases: bidding, play, and postmortem analysis.

late-game units. Showing up a little later with a bigger army can win you the game;
planning to show up much later with a huge army is bad for your chances, because
you will lose to a fast army before your huge army is built. A related RTS rock-paperscissors is the rush-eco-turtle (aka rush-boom-turtle) relationship, where a fast attack
beats an economic buildup, which in turn defeats a defensive strategy.
These rock-paper-scissors subgames5 do not determine the outcome of the game
all by themselves; they are merely one element. Enough other things are going on
that it is easy to miss the relationship of the elements in the subgame, because
winning or losing a particular subgame can easily be washed out by losing or
winning other subgames. But to some extent winning or losing the game as a
whole can be thought of as winning or losing enough of the various subgames. Many
elements of design can be broken down by looking at the subgames as well—for
example, a balance problem in one of the subgames (like rush being too good against
turtling, or ranged beating both air and melee) can spill out to break the game as a
whole.
Another abstract game that appears as part of many games is the “resource commitment game,” which can be modeled as follows: two players each have 10 points,
which they simultaneously distribute into three buckets A, B, and C. Then they
compare, and whoever wins two out of three is the winner. So for example if one
player chooses 7–2–1 and the other chooses 4–3–3, the latter player wins the game
since she won both B and C. Any military game where multiple areas are important
and it makes sense to split forces potentially has this subgame. At a tactical level,
Diplomacy is very much like this (at a strategic level, it is of course fundamentally
political). Of course, in many military games having the largest army after the clash
is most important, in which case each player brings his entire force, and there’s no
such army splitting and thus no abstract subgame, at least on this axis. Similarly any
game where a player distributes points when designing a character, starship, or other
game unit potentially has this abstract subgame. Again, this subgame can disappear
if it’s in the player’s interest to invest all or almost all of his points in a single area.
If a designer wants to preserve this subgame, it’s important to watch out for this
problem.
One can think of sports and other physical games as having physical skill subgames
as well. For example, running a sprint, or throwing and catching, can be thought
of as subgames of football. Note that many computer games (but few boardgames
and card games) have some physical subgames, typically involving reaction time and
eye-hand coordination, and some physical games (pool, rifle shooting, darts) have
5. When we call these “rock-paper-scissors subgames,” we mean this in a general sense. There
may be more than three strategies, for example. Really these are Von Neumann games (see
appendix A).

Games as Systems

relatively few of the physical skills we associate with sports (again, mainly eye-hand
coordination is involved).
Essential Game
If the game can be viewed as a disguised version of some abstract game, we’ll refer to
that abstract game as the “essential game,” as in “this game is essentially a chip-taking
game.” Essential games are most often found in multiplayer games with a lot of targeted interaction: the voting games and chip-taking games discussed earlier.
Note that when people say some game is “really just X” they usually mean to be
dismissive. But having an essential game is not necessarily bad. What is important is
that the essential game does not make all the other game mechanics superfluous, but
instead integrates them into some kind of cohesive whole. Overly political games can
fail on this account: how good you are at the various submechanics of the game may
not matter, and instead victory is determined solely by the politics. Very often, the
essential game of politics can be hard to uncover due to the slow but interesting
process of the development of positional and directional heuristics. A game that is
essentially a chip-taking game at a perfect level of play can in practice be far from
that. Here casual play explains why there are so few “classic” games with a chip-taking
essence relative to newer ones. Over time a player community will often be able to
uncover the essential game, perhaps leading to its decline if that underlying game is
unsatisfying, but a casually played game only a few years old is unlikely to encounter
this sort of problem.

Characteristic: Snowball and Catch-Up

Many games, especially multiplayer games, have “catch-up features”: features whose
purpose is to help losing players catch up, such as the shells (missiles) in Mario Kart
that let you shoot at the drivers ahead of you. And many games naturally have a
tendency to “snowball”: once you start winning, you win more and more due to your
initial advantage, such as the ability of a winning Monopoly player to use her money
to buy even more advantage. In Chutes & Ladders, one can think of the chutes and
the ladders as a catch-up feature—the viewpoint is slightly problematic given that it
is not obvious the chutes hurt the leader more than the other players, or that the
ladders help the loser more than the other players (more on this later), but surely if
one player were twenty squares ahead she would vote to get rid of all the chutes and
ladders if she could, and the players who were far back would vote against her. And
any political game tends naturally to exhibit catch-up in the form of “pick on the
leader” and sometimes snowballing as well in the form of “eliminate the weak.”

Figure 4.2

Games as Systems

107

But if one thinks about catch-up and snowball features a bit more, it becomes quite
tricky. Suppose you’re way ahead of me. But the game has a lot of catch-up features.
Then I still have a chance to win. Well, then perhaps you are not so far ahead of me
after all. (For example, a twenty-square lead in Chutes & Ladders might be basically
the same as a five-square lead in the equivalent game without the chutes and the
ladders.) Or, if the game has a lot of snowball features, then you are even further
ahead of me than it seems. In either case, how meaningful are the ideas of “catch-up”
and “snowball” at all? If we both understand the game well, we understand that
you are however far ahead of me you truly are, and “catch-up” and “snowball” are
illusory.
There is partial truth to this idea that catch-up and snowball are illusory. But it will
take us a fair amount of untangling to sort out what is really going on. We will start
by looking at some more examples of snowball and catch-up. Then we will give a
more precise way of defining the terms, look at how those more precise concepts reveal
the illusion, and examine how that illusion relates to the perceived realities of games.
Armed with our new (and hopefully more enlightened) viewpoint, we will look at a
number of issues surrounding snowball and catch-up.

More on Snowballing
Any game in which your score (either in the sense of official score that determines
the winner, i.e., victory points, or “unofficial” score in the sense of a simple and easy
to use metric, such as money) equals your power6 tends to have snowballing. Monopoly
is a classic example; more money helps you to make even more, until you are unstoppable. In no-limit poker, having a high score definitely increases your power. Chess
can also be viewed this way, if you think of “score” as your lead in pieces. On the
flipside, in go a territorial lead does not typically help you make even more territory.
Players often trade away territory for power, in the hope that that power will allow
them to get even more territory later in the game.
In most sports, having a lot of points doesn’t really help you score more. You can’t
“spend” a touchdown you made in football to get a new player.7 Boxing is one of the
few exceptions (and indeed boxing is also exceptional in having an explicit snowballhandling mechanism: early ending of fights by the referee). In a PvP computer game
with experience points and leveling up, snowball is the rule: win a few fights early,
and you will be higher-level and win even more fights later on (Defense of the Ancients
being an extreme example). In an RTS like Starcraft, if one thinks of army size, or army
size plus economy size, as a kind of score, then one certainly sees snowballing.
Another natural effect that increases snowballing in some multiplayer games arises
from players’ reaction to randomness (although randomness itself is generally a catchup feature; see below). If a game has a lot of uncertainty, knocking out a losing player
can be beneficial to the winning players. His elimination means he doesn’t have a
chance to randomly get lucky later and defeat one of the leaders. Poker is a common
example: players who are ahead in no-limit poker are typically happy to knock out a
player in a worse position.
Snowballing is often considered bad by designers and players. Partly this is just a
natural feeling of unfairness: why reward the player who is already winning? A more
sophisticated point of view is to think of it as a problem in logical elimination. Nobody
thinks it “unfair” simply because a game ends and someone wins it. What’s bad is
when someone who has little or no chance to win is forced to continue playing for a
long time before the game is over. So a snowball feature that directly leads to the end
of the game might be a fine thing (and in fact might not be perceived as a snowball
feature at all, but simply as a mechanism for determining when the game is over).
6. Power meaning your ability to make the game go your way—your ability to affect the overall
game state.
7. “Having points doesn’t help you score more” is true here only to first approximation. Certainly
one could argue that there are psychological gains from being ahead that might lead to scoring
even more points: momentum, demoralization of the other team, and so on. But that’s nothing
compared to the advantages of being able to put hotels on all your property in Monopoly.

Less appealing is a snowball feature that pushes the game to a state where the winner
has an even higher chance of winning, with the game still nowhere near its
conclusion.
One way to limit snowballing is to unlink power and score, say by adding victory
points that are used to determine the winner but that cannot be spent or otherwise
used during the game. Sports and European boardgames commonly use this technique.
The price of limiting snowballing in this way is often a more complicated game (gold
and victory points as in many European boardgames rather than simply dollars as in
Monopoly). Race games have this feature naturally: you typically can’t “spend” your
lead in the race to buy anything, so your lead in the race is simply a specialized and
intuitive kind of victory point. In fact, many physical races have something like the
opposite of spendable victory points in that not only can’t the leader “spend” her
lead, she is often harmed by her lead position due to air resistance and the ability of
nonleaders to draft.
Although designers largely tend to look for ways to limit snowballing, there are
often good reasons to increase it. If games are dragging on too long, or the game suffers
too much from player-elimination issues, adding snowballing effects can be helpful.
Rewards for knocking out a player (as in Risk) are one example.8 These are strictly
speaking snowball effects—they make losers lose by even more—but it’s often better
to have a 0 percent chance to win (and thus be able to go get a cup of coffee) than
to have a 1 percent chance to win (and thus be forced to remain in the game with
almost no chance for victory). Games that use the “eliminate the winners” mechanic
(e.g., a footrace, or the card game known variously as Asshole, President, or Dai Hin
Min) are similarly snowball games—once you drop out, you are no longer in any
danger of being the loser.
More on Catch-Up
The dynamic of the rich getting richer means snowballing tends to appear naturally
in games. By contrast, catch-up features are more often deliberately included, and less
often appear as natural outcomes of game features put in for other reasons.
There are countless examples of deliberately added catch-up features in games. The
shells in Mario Kart fire forward, so the person in the lead can’t make use of them, but
people who are behind can fire on those ahead of them. And the Spiny Shell specifically homes in on the person in first place. Some racing games go so far as to speed up
the car of anyone who is behind. In Warcraft III, the upkeep tax on large armies is a
catch-up feature limiting the snowballing effect of large-army dominance.
8. As mentioned above, some games (like poker) have these rewards naturally so they don’t need
to be added. In Risk, though, the odds of an all-but-eliminated player coming back and winning
are fairly small, so encouraging the knockout blow makes sense.

As mentioned above, any game with voting or other political features will typically
thereby have catch-up, sometimes to the point of making “in the lead” a meaningless
concept for much of the game. If someone has a clear lead, it is in the interests of all
the other players to stop him. Note that this kind of catch-up is especially agential—
one playgroup may think it is fine to pick on the leader, but another may impose
limits on it (similarly for political snowballing—various groups will be for or against
knocking out weak players, say). But politics is surely a net catch-up feature, since
picking on the leader in some form is all but universal in political games.
In general, randomness may be thought of as a kind of catch-up feature. Although
a random event may not differentially help losing players over winning players,
change in the game state is still appreciated more by the players who are losing than
by those who are winning.9 Reset buttons are one example: if a player is losing in a
race game, she is happy to play a card that says “everyone goes back to Start,” or that
scrambles everyone’s position around randomly. Note that although scrambling everyone’s positions at random is in some sense “treating all players equally,” it can only
help the person in last place and only hurt the person in first. Even a seemingly equitable random jolt like “each player rolls two dice and moves forward that many spaces”
is probably better for someone who is behind.
Expansion and Contraction of Win Probabilities
Saying that “each player moves forward a random number of spaces” is a catch-up
feature is perhaps counterintuitive (although the fact that the player who’s behind is
in favor of it is evidence in favor of this viewpoint). And we still haven’t addressed
the question of how meaningful catch-up is once you take it into account: if I’m way
behind you in Chutes & Ladders, but I might roll a 4 and land on a ladder and wind
up ahead of you, then I’m not really so far behind you after all, am I? To address these
issues, let’s try to be a bit more precise about what catch-up and snowball really mean
by creating a simple mathematical model of the progress of a game over time.
At any moment in a game, we can write down each player’s chance to win. Typically those chances will start out more or less equal (for a fair game), change somewhat
over the course of time, and then gradually shift toward 1 (for the winner) and 0 (for
everyone else).10 If we write the various chances for each player in a row, say for a
9. Indeed, a basic strategy common to all games with a certain minimum amount of skill is to
look for highly variable lines of play when losing, and to try and make the outcome as simple
and straightforward as possible when winning. Bridge is perhaps the supreme example—when
losing, assume various low-probability distributions of the cards in an attempt to find some
chance to win; when winning, try to find a line that succeeds no matter how badly the cards
are distributed.
10. Readers with some knowledge of mathematical modeling will realize that, like most models,
this one comes in a discrete-time and a continuous-time variety. We ignore such issues here,
although with its emphasis on events, our model is essentially a discrete one.

four-person game that lasts ten turns, we might see something like (0.25, 0.25, 0.25,
0.25) at the start of turn 1, (0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.35) on turn 4, and (0.9, 0.03, 0.03, 0.04)
on turn 9. We’ll call this list of numbers a state vector. Note that the sum of the numbers
is always 1.
If there’s no chance11 involved at all (i.e., the game is completely determined), then
the vector will look like (0, 0, 0, 1, 0)—all 0s for the players who have no chance and
1 for the player who is certain to win.
In a two-player game, if I am 70 percent likely to win at a certain point (perhaps
it’s a simple race game and I am eight squares ahead), and then later I am only 60
percent likely to win (perhaps you’ve rolled well and I’m only five squares ahead
now12), then you have caught up. If instead later I am 95 percent likely to win, then
that’s a snowball situation relative to the earlier game state.
What we’re really looking at is the spread of the state vector: as it spreads out, the
game is snowballing toward its conclusion. If the player who is behind catches up,
the vector will be less spread out. The standard way of defining spread is by the variance:13 the expected sum-of-squares deviation from the average. The average is just the
sum of the values divided by n, so for a state vector that’s 1/n. Thus for a state vector
( p1, . . . , pn) the variance is
[( p1 – 1/n)2 +

...

+ ( pn – 1/n)2]/n.

This number represents how far the state ( p1, . . . , pn) is from the “most caught
up state” (1/n, . . . , 1/n). Naturally, the state (1/n, . . . , 1/n) has the smallest
possible variance, namely 0. The largest possible variance14 belongs to vectors like
(0, 1, . . . , 0)—the most extreme snowball states.
So we’ll define a catch-up event as one that decreases the variance of the state
vector, and a snowball event as one that increases the variance.
It should be mentioned that ending state vectors like (0, 1, . . . , 0) represent a game
with a unique winner. Some games, however, end in draws, thus ending with minimum
11. By “chance” we mean uncertainty in the outcome of the game, not overt chance elements
like cards or dice. In this sense, even a game of chess has chance—in fact, quite a large amount
of chance between two evenly matched players, for whom the state vector in the early game
might be something like (0.47, 0.53). See section 5.1, on randomness.
12. Note that the number of squares until the end of the race factors into the probability estimate
of each player’s chances, in addition to the number of squares one player is ahead of the other.
For concreteness, you might like to imagine the race as two players taking turns rolling a single
die, with the winner being the first player to reach 100 total points.
13. The square root of the variance is called the standard deviation, and is another common
measure of spread. The variance is more convenient for our purposes—it’s easier to compute
with—but it conveys essentially the same information.

rather than maximum variance. This also happens in games with scaled victory conditions, for example poker, where the ending state of the players can be any redistribution of the total buy-in one likes.
Note that hurting the player in the lead and helping the player who is behind are
exactly the same thing in this model: if we go from (0.7, 0.3) to (0.6, 0.4) we have
both hurt the leader and helped the follower. Any increase in one player’s chances
must represent a decrease in the chances of some other player(s). Similarly, in a snowball event, the leader does better as the person behind does worse.
Thinking about games in this manner abstracts away a great many features, but a
surprising amount of the flow of the game can be read from the time history of a
player’s chances to win. Some examples:
Here’s a three-person game that progressed in a typical fashion (figure 4.4). One
player (the thick black line) started out with a 1/n = 1/3 chance to win, fell a bit
behind, started winning, and then continued to widen his lead until the end of the
game.
In the two-player game represented in figure 4.5 our player took a modest early
lead, but eventually lost the game.
Figure 4.6 shows what a player’s history might look like in a highly political game
(perhaps the chip-taking game), where none of the early choices matter because an
apparent lead results in getting “picked on.” The player represented by the thick black
line may have gained a lot of points early on, or he may not have, but none of that
affected his chances to win. Each player had about as good a chance to win as any of

the others throughout most of the game. The winner of this game was determined
entirely at the end.
This same graph might also describe a game with extremely strong catch-up features—for example, a race game where cars behind the leader are given a significant
speed boost.
In this unhappy game (figure 4.7), our player (the solid black line) was beaten
down about halfway through the game. At that point, she had almost no chance
to win, but she wasn’t actually eliminated until the very end of the game. (Perhaps
it was a race game in which she was so far behind that she had no real chance
to win.)
Catch-Up: What Is Apparent and What Is Real?
One might ask the question of what part of catching up is real and what part is illusory. Imagine a game with an easy first-order state heuristic like a race. The game has
a “catch-up mechanic” that helps people who are behind. Players enjoy playing
because they feel like they can catch up if they fall back and remember pleasurably
the number of great comebacks they have seen. But if players understand how this
mechanic works, they should adjust their heuristics and when they evaluate their
chances to win (i.e., use their new state heuristics) they will find there is no catching
up from behind in the race—in fact there is no falling behind and never was, at least
to the extent they once believed. It just means that a large lead on score really represents a small lead in chance to win.

Real catch-up features can come in two types. The first type is features that put
some limitations on how big the variance can get (until the very end) and how fast
it can get there. The second type is features that tend to reduce the variance in ongoing
games by having events that either end the game in favor of the leader or reduce the
variance going forward. For a simple example, consider a duel, with two duelists shooting in turn, each with a 60 percent chance to hit (which ends the duel). At the start,
the first shooter has a greater than 0.6 chance to win, but if he misses, the other
shooter is now ahead. Many games have features that work in this manner: the player
who is ahead must press his advantage and attempt to win quickly lest the other player
catch up.
It’s true that for games with a unique winner, it is common that catch-up is the
apparent catch-up that comes from imperfect state heuristics, not necessarily “true
catch-up” (if one thinks of “true catch-up” as variance control).15 But that’s okay. It is
important to remember that since it is rare for players to have perfect state heuristics,
it may be true that there is no reason to draw a distinction between a “true” versus
“apparent” catch-up feature. When a catch-up feature is put in, by and large what is
happening, as we have stated, is partially actual variance control and partially catch-up
relative to a particular heuristic—for example, the lead in Mario Kart. The feature’s
effect is one of muddying the heuristics, but as long as those heuristics don’t change,
for all practical purposes the effect is real—the player who thinks he is far behind
thinks he is catching up. The danger lies in players developing new heuristics, perhaps
seeing that there is no catch-up but instead only a nonintuitive ranking of the leaders,
and placing themselves back into the state the designer was attempting to avoid—
namely player dissatisfaction with their ability to come back from behind.
Catch-up features can still do good things:
Sometimes skill can be used to apply the catch-up feature if you are behind (or avoid
it if you are ahead).
• Catch-up features allow a nice first-order heuristic (score/position without the catchup feature considered) and a more advanced second-order16 heuristic. Since climbing
the heuristic tree is a big part of the enjoyment of games, that’s no small thing.
• Catch-up features keep more players in the game in the sense that they have a reasonable chance to win. In other words, catch-up features slow down the spread of the
•

15. And we’ll generally just say “catch-up” from now on, since there’s no point in making the
distinction any longer.
16. Strictly speaking, it may not be first-order and second-order. It may be third-order and seventh-order, say—“first-order” and “second-order” are a stand-in for “lower-order” and “higherorder.” Heuristics don’t have absolute numbers associated with them in any case; at best one can
say that a certain heuristic is more advanced than another (typically by taking the other one
into account, along with additional information).

state vector. The catch-up feature may also put a cap on the variance of the vector
until just before the end. (To see this is true, just consider a game with some catch-up
feature, and delete that feature partway through the game; now the players’ chances
to win are as far apart as they would seem with the simpler heuristic, which is further
apart than they would be with the more complex heuristic, i.e., with the catch-up
feature implemented.) In fact this may be the most important true catch-up function—
that at no time until the very end will any player have too great a chance to win.
Features like this often work better if player heuristics do not fully take this lack of
variance into account, so that players feel exciting “comebacks” are common.
• Catch-up features with the “maybe it fires, maybe it doesn’t” coin-flip type event
(the missile that hits or misses) make the point lead more random-seeming, make it
change more, and make the typical game more exciting for most players. Pushed to
extremes, this can backfire with some sophisticated players, who realize that the point
lead is such a bad indication of the true game state that they lose interest in it—a race
where nobody cares who is in the lead is probably not an enjoyable game. Worst of
all is if there is no useful state heuristic left whatsoever.
• Catch-up features can have the real quality that at any time the state vector has too
high a variance, the game will either end or shrink the variance. This effect is very
important since generally the harshest problem of having a small chance to win isn’t
losing itself, but rather playing a game where one has too low a chance of winning.
There are catch-up features that consistently deal with this problem by ending games
or making them fairer. Either way is often a gain for the player behind, especially in
a noncompetitive game.
Despite all these positive features of catch-up, it is worth remembering that it is often
easy to see the bad in snowballing, but not the good (control of game length, better
player-elimination characteristics), and the good in catch-up features, but not the bad
(poor positional heuristics, relative irrelevance of early-game choices, opportunity for
kingmaking because the last-place person has more power, overly long games).
Miscellaneous Catch-Up Topics
Now with more perspective under our belts, we can tackle several issues involving
catch-up and snowballing.
